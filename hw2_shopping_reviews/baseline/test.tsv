1	Human Hurricane!: Would you like to sleep in the same room as the human hurricane? Well that is exactly what Peter Hatcher has to do. He also has to live with his archenemy Sheila Tubman! Could anything be worse, yes Peter's little brother Fudge plots to marry Sheila Tubman grose! But now things are looking better for Peter, he gets to play baseball with Big Apfel who plays in the major leagues! And his best friend Jimmy Fargo is coming to it may not be that bad! I recommend this book to ages 4 and up
2	A Mom: I bought this with all kinds of expectations....the parts are not easy to attach. The attachments slideout easily when using and you have to start over.It is also very "loud"...after I was frustrated with using it I put it away and then a few months later I tried to use it and forgot how things went together....and realized how un-effective the whole system was...I end up using it for the car and keep putting the nozzle back in every few minutes...as it continues to slide out. I would have never bought this had I known how it worked overall....
3	Good Read: I judge all books that I read by a simple parameter - If I can get at least 1 worthwhile thought, piece of knowledge, or idea from any book that I read - then it was well worth it. This book gave me a few great concepts - with the most notable for me being "You can ALWAYS do more than you THINK you can". I am sure Richard Machowicz attained this thought process from his Navy Seal days...but I have used the concept frequently since I have read the book to help me attain higher results in a variety of situations than I may have previously. For me - that's a winner.
4	It's awesome: DVD set is exactly what you'd buy at any place like FYE but costs substantially less. Arrived right on time as well. The show itself is even more awesome than I remember it when it was originally on TV.
5	Great Movie!!!: This definatly the best Godzilla movie yet! The little B&W clip at the end of the movie was pretty cool to put in, but I've heard that the Japanese ending (with a FULL rolling credits screen) is a lot better. Anyway, if you WOULD buy this movie from Amazon.com because I ordered mine from Blockbuster and had to wait 2 weeks without a dollar discount!
6	BEST OF PARLIAMENT: This is a tight introduction to one of the greatest funk bands in music history. This first album by PARLIAMENT, is probably their most underated. The stand-out tracks are the title track, "The Goose", "I Can Move You If you Let Me", "All Your Goodies Are Gone" and "Whatever Makes My Baby Feel Good". If you are collecting Parliament's old works, definitely pick this one up!El-715
7	yuck for me, but others like it: Not my cup of tea at all. It is extremely spicey and the taste lingers. I bought it for a stomach soother because of morning sickness. I like ginger but not this, it was way too strong. I tried prego pops and drops and they have ginger in them just not as much. So if you're not a real ginger lover...aka can eat ginger straight w nothing else, try something else.
8	Fine, fine scholarly work: C.M. Reed has written a wonderful account of the true nature of trade in the Ancient Greek world. Myths and beliefs of Greek Maritime activity are completely debunked in this wonderful analysis.
9	Genius....pure genius: Baseketball is about a group of friends who form a winning team and experiences the trials and tribu.....ah who care! This is a Parker and Stone moive! It's crude. Its childish. It's disgusting. It's Homophobic. It's awesome! This movie will make you pee your pants laughing. But it's not for anyone looking for any kind of clean comedy. It's raunchy just like verything else that Trey and Matt do. A must have for any Southpark fan.
10	HORRIBLE GAME!!! FRUSTRATING!!!!: Unfortunately I had already purchased this game, then read all the negative reviews and figured that I would chance it...what a mistake!!! This game is impossible and is a waste of money! The concept was good but the design needs to be reworked or scrapped altogether. Do NOT buy this game...if you really need it you can have mine!
11	desappointed: Actually ,this book can't be reading... print quality is too bad, it's a pity...A purchase which is unnecessary...we wasted our money.
12	Frontline Plus: I live in the country and my dogs are out in the woods and weeds alot and this is the only brand that works the best for ticks and fleas.
13	VX-6000 doesn't work well with Vista Business: I couldn't get this to work from day one with microsoft vista business and their tech support gave me inaccurate solutions. I ended up getting a logitech pro 5000 webcam that works flawlessly
14	Not as good as I hoped: It does not pick up sound from across the room well. I bought it for a class but have not been able to get it to record well enough to help.
15	Perfume, Smerfume: I'm not much of a perfume wearer, but I got this for a present and I try to spray some on when I remember it's on the dresser. It smells really nice - light and floral, but it doesn't seem to last very long. After an hour or two, it has usually faded away.
16	Bourne Identity - the real version: A must see for those who liked the trilogy of Bourne books. True to the story (for the most part) their is no resemblance to the movie with Matt Damon. It is a pity that no one sought to follow up this movie as they did the others.
17	NO!: This was not a good purchase. The program came with 2 books, one was written in Russian! I have no idea what it's about!!!!!The other book was generic instruction, in English, but nothing about how to use this course. I was lost from the beginning. EVERYTHING of apparent value was written in Russian! I don't read or write Russian. This was a waste of money for what might have been a good course. Beware.
18	funny and serious and lots in between: A lot of books of poems are full of just funny poems, or only serious poems, but this book has a great mix of both! I can find poems for all my feelings here!
19	Not so happy: I'm dissapointed ,the alter lace was very long, i have to tie it in a knot. It is also loose on the back.I hope that it will shrink some after washing it. It's not worth my time to mail it back, so i'll keep it and make the best of it.
20	Terrible: I am sorry but this album is really really really bad. It is not really that artistic. It is just a bunch of people talking throughout the whole album to a certain beat.The only thing that I can say that is remotely positive is the animations.Besides that I wouldn't recommmend this album at all.
21	Super Sonic: Does the job very well. Good for boarding school dorms to avoid waking up other studentsAd says that it is a dual power model. It is true, but for 220v 50 cycles power a different power transformer is required. Unfortunately the ad does not say that nor does it give you the choice of power transformers. This is despite the fact that the product can be mailed overseas. Mine was mailed to New Zealand and was sent a US power transformer. Even when you have a suitable power transformer it may not keep correct time. This is because there is a switch to change from US to European power frequency. This switch is located underneath the 9 volt battery but it is not mentioned in the instructions.
22	Wonderful Purchase: I have no complaints about this product. It currently resides in my lab and everyone plays with it. Thank you.
23	Very disappointing is an understatement: I am a very big fan of this group, but I lost a lot of respect when they suck money out of my pocket and a bar band sounds better then the original group. Please guys except the inevitable and retire. Before you crash and burn. I would never listen again if it was a concert price I paid and not just a DVD. The only example I can give that suits the situation is a police officer should retire before he shoots the teller instead of the robber because he cannot see to aim the gun at the right person. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD, listen to the music of the past and be happy. They were a fantastic group and hopefully you can hold that memory and not the one I now have listening to this DVD. P.S. I only listened to two songs before I shut it off.
24	MAKE LOVE, NO MATTER YOUR AGE: I am a in my late twenties and this book is worth. There are secrest to make love as many times in one day and everyday.
25	Bob's Red Mill Golden Flax Meal, 4 pack: The golden flax meal is supposedly better for one's health. These come in a four pack, so I freeze alluntil needed. The one that I initially open goes into a clear freezer bag to retain freshness and iskept in the freezer. If flax meal ever smells rancid throw it out.Bob's Red Mill always delivers when it comes to product freshness and variety.Amazon's purchasing, delivery is always perfect.
26	Had pre-ordered, but then cancelled after ABC cancalled the series: There aren't many good scifi shows and movies that are aired on TV these days. "V" was one of the good ones. The SyFy channel airs lousy "B" rated cgi movies and shows about 80% of the time. Only good shows that are aired now are Eureka, Warehouse 13, Haven and if I don't fall asleep, Alphas. When ABC cancelled "V", I cancelled my pre-order of the 2 season of "V". Not to protest ABC decision to cancelled this great show, but I don't like buying something that will not have a good ending. In my opinion, "V" did not have and will not have a good ending. I bought the entire series of "Lost" because it was a great show and it had a good ending which was planned long before the finale.So here's a message for the yahoos at ABC. Shame on you.So go ahead guys, click on the option, "No" when asked was this review helpful. I don't care what you think. I'm glad I gave my two cents to those yahoos at ABC really stink!
27	Great extension cord: Very nice simple extension cord for two players, in one rewindable cord. The lights on the hub (which extend out to the players) are nice, but a added gewgaw. The cord and the hub are built tough, though the little handle for rewinding is a bit small and flops closed too easily. Minor complaint, though. For simple playing, this is the best extension cord I've seen. Glad I bought it.
28	Another great Pyrex: This is exactly what I was looking for: small prep bowls made of Pyrex. My dishwasher doesn't always get all the dishes spotless, but it's usually the Pyrex and Corelle dishes that come out the cleanest. Since I could be making sauces and have oily ingredients in those bowls, easy cleanup is key.I was also hoping that these could be my extra, alternate ramekins, but they're much smaller than the ones I have, so I'm not sure it would work for that purpose. Nevertheless, I highly recommend these!
29	Indian Music and dance: Okay, so I admit, I know nothing of real legitimate truth about India or it's people and this movie did nothing to increase that knowledge. But I do get a laugh-out-loud kick out of Americans who imitate the Indian accent. (I hope it doesn't offend anyone.) The only real hillarious part of the movie, for me, was when "Mr Toad" and Asha switched accents and some mannerisms on the ferry. First time I watched the movie, I laughed out loud during this scene and it scared my dog who was sleeping on my lap at the time. (Which made me laugh harder).I can't say I learned much about India nor were there any real eye-opening plot twists or turns.This movie is a good one for a relaxed afternoon when you don't have anything else to do but chill out on the couch with a dog on your lap.
30	BEST TEA N THE WORLD: I was introduced to this tea ten years ago by a friend in Ireland. It is THE best. I've tried other Irish/British premium blends......nothing is as rich and smooth as Lyons. Love it.
31	Great movie - powerful, but why no stereo or surround sound?: Kubrick's strongest movie ever made. The DVD is a great extension of the VHS version offering clear video. The sound is also cleaner but why no stereo or surround effects? Seems like absolutely nothing is coming out of the rear channels. If you can't wait, buy it. If you can, hope that a criterion version comes out later.
32	It was a Wonderful Book!!!: Yes, I would recommend this book to my friend because I think anyone who loves to read about history would love this book. And also anyone who loves to wear ball gowns would love to read about all the costumes Scarlett wears in this book. Over all anyone could love to read this book.
33	Sticky Label Can Be Removed: Yes, the glue for the label is not acceptable, but it can be removed. Lighter fluid and a lot of elbow grease will remove the tacky adhesive. The supplier should use some other type of adhesive, no excuse. That being said, the cookie sheet is wonderful. I knew the label would be an issue, but I ordered the cookie sheet anyway, and it is of good quality and bakes evenly and well. Fits perfectly in the Breville oven.Alana
34	The other version is ultimately better, buuuut....: This version of Samantha Mumba seems like an indefinitely out-of-date, unpolished, unhip counterpart of its worked-over more recent version which has far more attractive, colorful cover art and the polished radio pop remixes of "Baby Come Over" and "The Boy." Which version you will prefer, however, relies heavily on your taste. This disc leans far more towards R&B and hip-hop, while the reworked version with the yellow and red cover is pretty much pure pop. I prefer the other version because it's just more fun and twice as infectious, but like I said, it depends on your taste. The original version of "Baby Come Over" is actually cool in its own way-I could picture it on black radio, while the fizzy pop remix fits white pop radio best.
35	One star is generous for this book....: The trite plot, poor writing, and tired cliches make this book one of the *worst* books I have ever read. Lines such as, "At whom are you pissed?" are laughable at best. Every character speaks in the same manner, bland and false. Ugh!
36	Just didn't fit: I picked these up on a Gold Box special for $40. Figured it was worth a shot at that price.Pros:* They do cancel the noise. Not quite as nice as the Bose but the price was much better. I couldn't hear anyone outside my office as I usually do. The 2 stars was for this.Cons:* The overall sound quality was poor.* I tried all the different earpieces and found all of them to be very uncomfortable. I cannot imagine wearing them for any extended period of time.So I sent mine back. I guess I will have to give up on in-the-ear earphones.
37	Excellent and Exciting: This is the last book of a three part story, which I hated to end. I loved this book and hope it becomes a movie one day. When I first started reading the Trilogy, Book 1, I wasn't sure I liked it but I stuck it out and then started thirsting for more and now its over and I just have such fond memories of the characters. Excellent reading!
38	At least it wasn't hardcover this time!: Wow, what a disappointment. I was not really thrilled with the last Dark Hunter book, and was hoping this one would get back in the swing of things. So far I've had the book a week, and still have not been able to get through the whole thing. I'm almost done though, so maybe the last few pages will get better.I think SK has fallen into the pattern that a lot of series seem to fall into. After a few books, a major, tragic hero emerges from the secondary characters, and everyone wants to read his story. But once that book is done, the series is over, so the author stretches things out to keep us buying, dropping little hints of his story to tantalize the readers. Unfortunately, in the quest for Acheron's story, SK seems to have run out of good material in the meantime.
39	Only watch it around friends...so you can laugh and disect how bad this crap really is!!!!: This is absolutely one of the worst THINGS I have ever seen. It is so terrible that I almost couldn't stand anymore. The acting is terrible, the characters are terrible cliches, the setting is dumb, and the story is absolutely atrocious. This film bottom line sucks. I bought it for a penny here just because of its reputation. Also because usually my friends and I go to the dollar stores at the mall to buy $1 movies that are really bad so we can quote them and laugh at them. It sucks so bad...the seller should pay you to take it off of his hands. I keep it in my backpack and bring it out in school as a conversation starter, along with the film Surf Ninjas, another really bad film...look it up. [...]
40	Better than history class: Entertaining and informational. A really good balance. I found this book an effective and interesting way to relate to history.
41	A fine adventure film with WW II as the backdrop.: A very good and diverse cast of characters. Eastwood plans a gold heist. The production values, cast and story line make it a very watchable movie. I've seen it many times and always stay to the end.
42	Should be recalled: We got this bike from Walmart for an active 4-year-old boy. He loved it. But one training wheel kept loosening; it would not stay tight. So we tested it a lot. After only 3 days of riding, a pedal broke off. When I tried to put it back on, I noticed a sharp metal splinter on the edge of the screw assembly. I cut myself on the sliver, which then broke off. Couldn't reattach the pedal. And the metal splinter would be very dangerous had our 4-year-old tried to reattach the pedal instead of me. This bike should be recalled. BUYER BEWARE!
43	what a crock!: I fault myself. This is one smart lady! Bottom line...This does NOT work. I wish I had thought of it. Waste of money.
44	Cant get enough!: Mike is a funny guy and this is a great DVD collection, nuff said! The case is good quality and the disc was in excellent shape, no complaints
45	Standard Reference Work: This book is part of a series of books that has been coming out now for many years. They consist of an article section, a trends in cutlery section (with lots of artfully done photos, and a directory section of the cutlery collectible trade and custom makers, etc. I have the whole run and look at them now and again for reference.
46	BEST PRODUCT I'VE TRIED!!!!!!: i ALWAYS READ REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASE A PRODUCT, BUT I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN ONE BEFORE. I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS ON THIS SITE AND I'M SO GLAD THAT I DID. I'VE BEEN USING THE DERMAWAND FOR 2 WEEKS NOW AND I SEE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE TEXTURE OF MY FACE AND THE BAGS UNDER MY EYES ARE GOING DOWN. I HAVEN'T NOTICED THE WRINKLES GOING AWAY YET, BUT I LOVE THE WAY MY FACE IS LOOKING. MY NEW DRIVERS LICENSE PICTURE TELLS THE WHOLE STORY (JUST GOT IT YESTERDAY) I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! SINCE TURNING 40, I'VE TRIED AT LEAST 13 PRODUCTS OFF OF THE INTERNET, AND THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED! THANK YOU!
47	Spend a Little More and Get an Illustrated Copy...: I checked out Racketty-Packetty House from the library. It was a sweet story and my 7 year old daughter loved it. She read it in one sitting. Her reading level is 5th grade. This edition is a thin paperback with pretty small type and no illustrations. I did expect that for $2.50, but I had hoped for a little larger type and a few black and white illustrations. There aren't any. So, I wouldn't recommend this edition. The stories and vocabulary in this book are great for advanced 2nd and 3rd graders, but not with this size type.Instead, I'd recommend this edition of the Racketty-Packetty House:The Racketty-Packetty House: 100th Anniversary EditionThe illustrator who illustrated this book also illustrated the Cobble Street Cousins books by Cynthia RylantA Little Shopping: Ready-for-Chapters (Cobble Street Cousins), which I'd also recommend for young girls this age range. They're very sweet early chapter books.
48	Terrible......: Terrible system. Mine actually worked for two years and then died. But their customer support is terrible and I'm looking at a $600 paperweight.......terrible.
49	False product advertising: Product does not work in households with fiberoptic lines and does not work world wide on phone line, you need to have a wireless connection. After spending so many hours trying to get it to work, I just gave up and returned. It's not worth your time!!!!
50	The Town is Hopelessly Damned: Another overwrought French film which suggests to the viewer that life stinks, especially for the working class, for whom, apparently, there is no joy or beauty. So you might as well kill yourself or kill the perceived source of your anguish. I really learned nothing about the complicated social fabric that is Marseilles or how the troubles that afflict these French might be addressed. I think this movie appeals to people who enjoy being manipulatd and are happy to leave the theater saying "Mon Dieu! That was wrenching!"
51	Nice & relaxing: Bought this CD to use at a wedding, but listen to it so much more at home. It really relaxes while listening to some great music. It is also so fun to have other U2 fans try to guess what songs are playing when they 1st hear the CD. I have really enjoyed my purchase.
52	Fraud: First clue the women pictured on the DVD cover are HOT and not in the movie. The movie is about four college friends, two of whom have a bet to see who can bag the most milfs. Three of these friends would have trouble getting to second base with a blowup doll. In the beginning they get shot down by everyone, yet somehow find women drunk enough to have sex with them. There is one good looking woman in the film. She is not a milf she is a student. Don't get excited. You are led to believe you are seeing her exposed breast after someone bumps into her at a party and her breast slips out of her halter. They actually used a boob double. The mystery boob is only shown in a closeup. I gave this a one star rating because I don't think they allow a zero star rating. The only redeming quality would be if you have never seen a woman's naked breast before you will in this movie. I already tossed my copy. Beware.
53	Boobs and Blood - Little Else: Nothing much beyond nudity and nonsense. Bloods and Boobs, little else. A little humor, production quality and special effects were redeeming, but really a waste of time.
54	Plastic seems a bit flimsy: The gate is a bit long and the panels feel kind of cheap. Mine was shipped to me damaged and i had to get a replacement. Overall, ive been using this product for a few weeks now and it does its job. I recommend this product if you have a big indoor space for your kids/pets or its a good playpen to take with you outside. Its a bit on the heavy side so pls becareful
55	Controversial and powerful: President Marie Arcola is a character who is put into a timely situation of judge and jury. And as Americas first woman president she not only has to deal with threats of international magnitude, she also must deal with the demons of abortion laws, gun control and threats to religious thinking. If you can read between the lines of this story, you will see this author is trying to open our eyes to America with a woman president. If you listen to the news and read the papers, we are about to have a woman president in real life. Is Lady President a warning or a blessing?
56	There is no way this could make the Olympic Team: This game is horrible. It only has six different events, and the graphics are not that good. the playability is not that good. it is extremely hard to control the board and skis in the alpine and slolom as well as the snowboarding event. the ski jump is very bad. don't buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!
57	planer: I used the plane only once, to plane some antique 1 by 12s and it worked fine. Amazon had a great price, and it seems to be a good product for light and moderate usage.
58	Bones: The most addictive show on TV: I hadn't ever watched this show before January 2011. That's when I got a temporary roommate with a 65 inch TV who sucked me back in to watching TV instead of reading books and playing on my iPad. I discovered several really good shows, but Bones topped them all. Of course, I wanted to see what led up to the last season cliff-hanger, so I picked up all the earlier seasons. I wasn't disappointed. The show was good from the pilot, but it seems that this cast and crew have a goal to make each show and season better than the last one - and they succeed almost every time,
59	Horrible Harry ant invation: I do not like this book it made no sence and was confusimg.It was about a kid that got ant duddy and lost it by letting ant's go. I would not recamend this book.
60	An integrated work of art.: First the bad news: the introducers such as Steve Martin are annoying and add little to the movie.But the good is very good. And all the segments are connected to each other and form a integrated work of art -- not just visually, but in terms of ideas. And make no mistake, it is a wonderful piece of art. They arranged some of the music into shorter-than-composed bits? Hey, symphonies do that all the time. The important thing here is the synergy between the sound and the image.If you can't see what's going on, try watching Seven Brides for Seven Brothers first. That will spur some ideas.Fantasia 2000 is a perfect example of Disney's best work. It's appropriately rated G, but is filled with so many ideas that people of all ages and backgrounds may enjoy it in many different ways.Better than the first? No but just as good in its own way.
61	The Best Film Ever: I love this movie. It is my all time favorite film. Many pf the people that I know that have seen it don't get it, and therefore don't like it. I think it is a beautifuly made film showing us how we see beauty in the world. The perfect american family on the outside but on teh inside is where the real beauty lies. When we think of beauty we all see the rose petals and the beautiful girl but this movie shows us the real beauty in everyday life. the way one event can change a man's life forever, a bag floating in the wind. It asks us to look at life at a different angle and find the beauty there, and everywhere.
62	Blindsighted: Ok, not a page turner. Not blindsighted at all by this book. Wish I had bought it for fifty cents at Goodwill, then it would have been worth the money. I am hard to please, so if you like books that are a fast easy to forget book, then you might enjoy it. Land fill. Glad it was a Kendal book.LOL
63	Terrible reuse of episodes from Season 3: This "movie" was absolutely terrible! It's just a combined re-edit of four episodes from Season 3 of Tripping the Rift. MY two cents: skip this and purchase Season 3 instead!
64	Way Overhyped.: I bought this game after trying the demo, thinking the demo was a sneak peek at what would be an even better final commercial product. What I didn't realize was that nearly everything in the commercial product was already seen in the demo. The same bland environments (3 total) The same enemy (nothing but guys in black body armor) No real in-game plot. No puzzles, no non-weapon equipment. Very little suspense. As soon as I saw a flashlight that needed recharging every 15 seconds, the lack of friendly fire (shoot at an ally and the bullets don't hit them), and gratuitous use of explicit foul language and blood, I knew what I was in for, because those are all things a company throws in when a game isn't well-rounded enough. The enemy AI and physical performance were interesting, but that's mainly all this game has to offer. And for a game that demands cutting edge hardware, the graphics still are bland, repetetive, and overall disinteresting. I wish I had waited for the Bargain Bin.
65	confused: So if The Wonder Years hasn't been released on DVD yet, why are there so many copies for sale on EBay? Are these people selling DVD's that they burned themselves and isn't that illegal?
66	WOW! Such a Variety of Sound!: I bought this CD for one song and was surprisingly pleased to like almost all of them. They have such a mix of music and lyrics that it is hard not to relate to most of them. I want to order this CD for all my friends. It really puts you in a good mood. It was definitely a great buy from Amazon.com. I hope you all decide to buy this CD and enjoy it as much as we do!
67	book: One of Peck's set that I thoroughly enjoyed reading! He is a wonderful story teller and has great chacters! It arrived as desired.
68	Awful: I rented this book on CD for a long drive and it was so bad, that my daughter said "Mom turn this off it is stupid". I agreed but we finished it anyway. It was the worst Fern Michaels book ever. So ridiculous you had to laugh. I gave the two stars because it took time to write. That is the only reason. Don't waste your time.
69	The Emperor's New Clothes: You know that feeling you get after you read a great review and then the product sucks? You feel tricked and used, and you wonder if there is a genuine difference of opinion of if somebody had a friend or relative on the reviewing staff. I live in New York. Have you got any idea how many fabulously talented singers are in this town? Then Amazon has to go and praise this tepid tinkle-bar canarie. It's offensive to all the truly inspired and inspiring singers out there.
70	HARDEST GAME ON EARTH: I don't consider myself the best gamer on earth.. but i have some experience... this game surpases every level on hardness i've seen in my life... (save for the ninja gaiden ones)but it's great =D
71	What a pleasant surprise!: Our 6-year-old grandson took me into his bedroom and locked the door. "Do you have a book to read?" he asked. "Yes," I said, "I have many." "Well, you must read this book, and as soon as you finish, you must bring it back." He handed me "The Beejum Book." I was not especially looking forward to reading a children's book, but I began that evening. Soon I was reading passages aloud to my husband, astounded at Ms. Howell's clever weaving of valuable lessons into her amazing tale. I rationed my readings, extending the pleasure as long as possible. When I came to the end, I handed the book to my husband. He read it straight through. The tale is wonderful, the lessons for all.
72	Great CD (but 2 thumbs down on Clint Eastwood): I really love jazz. I enjoyed seeing the movie "Midnight", as far as the CD goes- it's good, all except for Clint Eastwood's version of 'Ac-cent-tchu-ate The Positive'. Overall a great tribute to Johnny Mercer- "Savannah's Own".
73	UFO's helped me physically understand God: Thank God for bringing this book to me. God could have chosen any number of ways to reach me, but he chose this book. It was just the start of my journey to know God's word. But, the start is an important part. For someone who has no spiritual understanding, things that people would be able to see with their eyes, like UFO's and technology, are an important part of coming to learn the rest of the story.Now that I have come to accept Christ as my lord and personal savior, and have delved into the bible, there are things that I see differently from the author. Some aspects of it could have been written with more detail.I did not find the book to be hostile to Christianity. He may disagree with some religious practices, but bible verses support his disagreements. For the non-Christian can reader, it is good to distinguish between Christian practices and the way of the heathen.
74	Great collection for young fans: I bought this collection for my 8-yr old who recently became Harry Potter obsessed. The books come in a colorful, neat package that appeals to young readers. I was glad to find the first six books in one collection. It's a very affordable option to buying them separately. The books keep her interested in reading with fantastic characters and storylines. A great buy!
75	I'll take an "overbearing...paean" like this anytime!: As I listened to that beautiful voice singing with and from her heart, I couldn't help but recall the old Johnny Mathis ballads that inspired generations of young lovers. How refreshing it is to hear Ms. Streisnad bring out those same emotions in "boomers" so many years later. To me, there was nothing "overbearing" (as found by your reviewer) in her delivery, unless one considers honest emotion and warmth to be overbearing. I rejoiced in hearing a woman in her 50's celebrate in song the love and happiness she feels for her husband. Bravo, I say; dim the lights, uncork the champagne, put some logs in the fireplace, light the fire! Oh, and restart and replay the CD.
76	A great 250-page novel - too bad this one is 600 pages!: Tom Clancy had it all. His first four novels were terrific, and I literally stood in line to buy each new volume. Then, Mr. Clancy somehow made the grave mistake of believing he was above editing. His last four or five books are readable, but barely. Red Rabbit is unquestionably the most overwritten book I've ever read--which is to say Clancy could have used ten words when he used 40. Red Rabbit is WAY too long, and the plot drags along in places in a way I've never seen in a book from a major publishing company. The backstory on Jack Ryan should have been interesting, but this boring manuscript makes me seriously wonder why I would ever buy another Tom Clancy book again. If you love this author's early work, avoid this book--it will singlehandedly destroy the Jack Ryan franchise for you forever.
77	Outstanding Nutcracker: The picture didn't do this nutcracker justice. It is beautiful and I would highly recommend this to any collector or lover of nutcrackers. This is going to the be the centerpiece of our nutcracker collection.
78	Huge Improvement In Their Sophomore Album: I was a fan of From Here On In.I played the record many times, and I do enjoy it. However, it's hard to deny that at times the songs didn't get lost and a bit flattened out by the production so that they'd blend a bit too much into one another.This time, the production is much lighter and the band is able to shine a bit more. South are able to create a beautiful wall of sound and it gives the album a feeling of being drenched in a sort of hopeful melancholy.The album has a bit harder-edged sound. It's just enough to punctuate certain moments and let the songs really shine. The songwriting is greatly improved, and you'll be humming along in no time.Personal favorites are Motiveless Crime and Loosen Your Hold.
79	Canisters: I was looking for this shade of red for my kitchen......and it was the perfect color. The only thing I didn't care for was the fact that each canister had a different design......would have preferred all one......but it doesn't take away the fact that the color is great!
80	very frustrating: The difficulty in getting my movement to register with the game makes the whole game pretty useless for me. To keep the leg strap from sliding, I have to tighten it very tight, which seems unwise (restrict the flow of blood to muscles you're working? Bad.) In many of the arm-movement exercises, my arm movements aren't registering well with the game at all. I spend at least a third of my exercise time not actually exercising, but adjusting and attempting to get the game to know what I'm doing.Since I don't have trouble with any other Wii games' knowing what the Wiimote or nunchuk are doing, this seems to be a Wii Active specific problem.And I'm not really getting much use from the game. Only frustration.Your mileage may vary.
81	Disappointing: Although there are some interesting moments on the path to human enlightenment, the author spends too much time on gratuitous chase scenes. They slow the narrative. However, I do like the efforts the characters make to push fear away by emanating the energy of love. These are realistic, useful practices.
82	Bad pilling: These sheets are fine enough, but I expected more. I guess you get what you pay for. Bad pilling after third washing. Also, the "sand" color I ordered is a bit yellow for my taste.
83	It's a fake!!: I met Dr. Laura a couple months ago and when I asked her to sign this book, she pushed it aside and said, "Get your money back. I didn't write it." I wondered why it was published by a different company from the one she has always used (Harper Collins). So, let this be your caveat. Don't buy it. Although, I have read it and it ain't that bad...
84	Great clock, OK radio: I like the large readout, and the way it resets itself when power blips during the night. It is also very accurate, and the dual alarms work well. The one weak point with it is the radio tuner. The dial for volume works well enough, but the dial for tuning is not very precise. It takes quite a few tries to lock in the station you want, and if you are not very careful, you end up bumping the tuning dial when you are trying to snooze/turn off the alarm, so great clock, OK radio.
85	Good Beginning, Slow Middle, Awful Conclusion: I'm not really into horror books, and haven't read but a couple of King's. I loved "From a Buick 8" and "Lisey's Story". This one, though, seemed to be written at about a sixth grade level. You really had to suspend reality to get through this one. How did people in different places hundreds of miles apart come up with the same terms, like "phoners", and "pulse", etc.? And I don't believe for a second that Clay, when he finally stumbles across his wife, would shove her out of his way like she'd never meant a thing to him. My biggest problem with the book is that King never tells us what caused the pulse, who did it, why they did it, was his son ever ok, did the world re-build itself, and on and on. I actually checked the binding of the library book because I was sure the last pages were torn out! I don't need an author to connect all the dots . . . just the POINT of the whole thing!
86	A Boring score!: It's seems like Dolores Claiborne, but there is no melodic. Dolores Caliborne is better. I'm very desapointed for this score. ''Main titles'' and ''End credits'' are quite good...
87	Fun adaptation of classic stage thriller!: Carol Lynley looks like she's having a ball in this fun, creepy version of the stage play about a bunch of would-be heirs stuck spending the night in a house of horrors. If your kids are planning a slumber party, or you're in the mood for Drive-In fare, this is an entertaining choice for your movie viewing!
88	break out cd!: This is one of the best CDs from Yellowcard. After debuting in 2001, they've finally reached stardom with Ocean Avenue. Branching out from the normal punk sound...Yellowcard uniques themselves from the masses with Sean Mackin on the violin. This cd has a wide variety of music that every punk fan would enjoy. <3
89	Not a medical thriller: This is a good book to read, is a thriller, but not a medical thriller, the book will keep you reading all the time, but whether it could be true or not the end is not a good one, of course you just can't kill everybody (animals and humans) at the end but I consider that the book must have another end.
90	Not what I expected, but: .. but Beautiful.Functional.You'll need to get them really clean, you know, get all the sandstone particles off so they feel smooth, and don't scratch. Then, they work better than cork coasters -- well, I got them when it was turning cool, so we'll really see in summer, with humidity turning the outside of glasses into mini waterfalls.But, I'm really amazed at how they absorb.I just wish the colors were more brilliant -- dull compared to the picture here.
91	Another movie pretending to be more than it is...: Watched an hour and couldn't watch anymore. Nonplussed storyline and empty characters. Usually I love John Cusack, but this was BORING!
92	This product could be old: Even though the seller is the manufacturer, it would not stand behind the freshness of the product shipped by providing the product manufacturing date.This very expensive product loses efficacy when old.And if manufacturer hides the product freshness, what else are they hiding from me? A bad ingredient? This stuff goes on my skin, I simply can't trust them.
93	Too bad SOE doesnt care about its customers!: You would think that a company would take into consideration the thoughts of its players. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the designers of the Star Wars Galaxies team (SOE= Sony Online Entertainment). They will charge you for expansions and then turn around and remove 80% of the professions that you have spent months developing. They do this with NO warning and will not refund money. They do not support the needs and desires of the playing customers. If there were ever an example needed of what not to do with your online customers, SOE could write the book.
94	I'll 2nd " Mediocre also rans......" review: Out of 17-18 tracks per CD- i might have found 3-5 i liked but no more than that.Reggae, especially 70's reggae is alot more of a mover than this pleasant-verging-on-blah compilation.
95	Hello, and welcome back to fifth grade.: I'm a big fan of some of some of the most off color, raunchy, in-bad-taste humor there is, and a lot of these jokes were funny the first time I heard them... In grade school.This book is nothing more than Blanche Knott's Truly Tasteless Jokes with a new cover, and really, that book isn't very funny once you hit puberty either.
96	laugh out loud funny: I really enjoyed this film, laughed all the way through. Cuba is great, Horatio and he have good chemistry together, and Will Farrell puts in a surprise hilarious cameo. Pure silly fun
97	Definitely worth buying on blu-ray: The film is buy far one of the best blu-rays that i have bought. Also its worth the price i paid $20 for a blu-ray and dvd. I would recommend this for others to buy.
98	Dead Book Walking: How can a chaplin make money off of the trouble lives of prisoners on death row? Shame on the author and shame on the publisher. The story is really not that good anyway, but the premise of the book is even worse!
99	Creationist Propaganda: William Steig has written some very wonderful, charming books like "Amos and Boris" and "Sylvester and the Magic Pebble." But this book isn't charming or wonderful; its only attribute is that it is advocates Creationism. The story consists of two wooden dolls who wake up and try to figure out where they came from--whether they were made by someone or just accidentally created by nature. Unlike Steig's other books, the story is rather flat and not very entertaining.If you are a creationist looking for a book to help indoctrinate your kids, you'll love this book. But otherwise, you definitely will want to look elsewhere.
100	Leaves Me Cold: Barak steals it. As the crazed Frenchy speed demon, his effeminate stereotype crushes France and Ricky Bobby, the Will Ferrell - All-American NASCAR Driver alter ego with a sloppy kiss. The rest of the film is dumb Southerners uttering stupid cliché's in standard hate-redneck speech. You think I'm kidding. No, this film is one more blast at your average red state, Bush loving, and dumb gum chewing, big boob, blonde Southern folks. That is the way those Liberals in Hollywood at their cocktail parties lambaste the suckers that buy the tickets.One more note, the arcade game look of the races and crashes has gone beyond clay models. Still, these special effects that look something like Madden Football, leaves me cold.
101	Great product: The shade works very well and everyone asks where I got it. My children bought first and then convinced me to purchase.
102	The Syringa Tree: This is one book I did not finish. I read all of Part I and got tired of waiting for something to happen. It is written beautifully, but I gave up on the plot.
103	Very surprised by how small: OXO generally makes great stuff and I have plenty of it. I thankfully read some comments here about the size and decided to walk 3 blocks to my nearest Bed and Bath to see for myself. At 5'11" and 170 lbs I do not consider myself to be that large but do have pretty big hands for my size. These things were tiny. Didn't fit at all. Maybe they are the greatest gloves in the world but only if you have small hands. I went with the Calphalon mitts and am rather content with them.
104	Buy "SnowBlind" & play it on Xbox Live, PLEASE!!!: Recommended. "Project SnowBlind" is a cool Xbox Live game, but hardly anybody is ever online to play it! That's a real shame because this game has a lot of weapons & features that make it fun & interesting. You can even set up clans to play the usual shooters events like capture the flag & deathmatch, etc. There is downloadable content available too. Good graphics & many different vehicles add to "SnowBlinds'" replayability factor. The single player mission is okay, giving you many possible approaches to solving a mission or killing enemies. This title is surely trying to measure itself up against the "Halo" franchise, which is good for us as gamers.
105	Great product: I have never owned a hot air brush dryer before, but I am so glad that I tried it. I find it much easier than blow drying with a regular hair dryer and brush and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. I looked around before buying this model and settled on this one because it had both a brush and curling/straightening attachment.
106	A slap in the face to the first two: If you enjoyed the first two Godfather movies, you're not going to enjoy the third. Compared to the first two and other great Mafia movies, the Godfather 3 pails in comparision. Francis Ford Coppola should have stopped after the second and he shouldn't have casted his daughter to play Mary Corleone. Bottom line.....The movie sucked!!
107	It was entertaining: Well, Britney is no actress and she never claimed to be.The movie was cheesy but sweet and I thought that the other actors did a great job.Well, I was entertained and I enjoyed the movie.It was sweet. If I could give Britney some advice I would say get an acting coach and NEVER PLAY IN A ROLE WHICH INCORPORATES SINGING INTO THE STORY.
108	All my favorite Rolling Stone songs are here!!: I knew the video would be lacking from the other reviewers' ratings, but come on Mick.....learn the words to your own songs and stop making the words up!! I was hoping for a far better sounding mix that what I actually heard!
109	A superb read!: Robert Heinlein's Hugo Award winning "Starship Troopers" should be on everyone SciFi reading list. This book is a social commentary delivered in a fun and engaging story. For those hesitant to read this book due to the shortcomings of the movie...don't worry. The movie is an anemic and superficial substitute.
110	Love It: This tea is naturally sweet and has a very good flavor. The spicy aroma makes others around you ask what smells so good, what are you drinking? It makes excellent ice tea as well. It is my all time favorite!
111	Braun's Boo Boo: I regret to review this item because it was a big disappointment to me. Some of Braun's other products are better. I'd thought this might be useful as a complete hair remover for all parts of the body but it doesn't even fulfill its basic function. It not only did not remove the hair on my legs; it was very painful to use. I've been trying to recall how to return it as it is of no use to me. An ordinary electric shaver seems to work better.
112	Coffee Maker: We've always sworn by Bunn Coffeemakers, this is our first bad one. The coffee basket overfills and spills coffee grounds and water all over our counter. We've tried changing filter brands and that didn't help. The coffee we wind up with is weak and has grounds in it. It's being returned.
113	YMSB: Just about everything they do is worth buying and listening to. An excellent album for a new fan or seasoned veteran.
114	Same track listing as explicit version - it does contain "Alibi": This album should have got 3 stars but for the gorgeous Keith Sweat produced track "Side Show" (this was the only song he contributed to the album). If only Keith worked with Silk more instead of Delite Allamby who produced most of this album. Forget about Love Sessions, Silktime and the Tonight albums as Delite wrote and produced their music & get their first two albums Lose Control and the self titled Silk. "Side Show" saves this disc, but I would just download the song.
115	This is yes.: I love this band. I wish my French teacher in High School played these guys instead of "Le Rap Celtique" or Manau. If she had these guys, I would be speaking fluent French by now.
116	Toddler Band: We got this for my little girl's first birthday. She seems a little young for the xylophone, but I know she'll grow into it. As other reviewers have commented, it really is in tune and is an excellent purchase. The other toys are less exciting but are fun if you want to try to have a little band and make music together.
117	NEVER use this company.: Tried to cancel order two hours after placement. I was ignored by oncesoldtales.All emails are verified and logged with Amazon. I had to give them a one star rating, it will not let me go any lower.
118	Typical Brown!: A claustrophobic, virginal, dysfunctional, young (maybe 27)school teacher (Laney)meets a handsome, confident (at times arrogant), loving, older (42) New York attorney (Deke) meet during a brief black out in the Big Apple. They spend one magical night together (where she looses her virginity and he finds love), that will change both of their lives forever. Laney who had been told when she was young that she was barren, finds herself pregnant from a one night stand. The rest of the story resembles the typical Sandra Brown love story in that Deke tracks her down, showers her with love and attention, something she is starving for, and sets out to exercise the demons that her mother has instilled in her. Apparently Laney's mother "resented her and couldn't love her" because she blames Laney for her husband's departure. Deke's desire to be apart of Laney's life and his unborn child spins a cute story that is easy to read and not too heavy. I enjoyed it.
119	Well illustrated book of growing tropical orchids.: Written by the Orhcid Society of South East Asia,the photographs are outstanding and cultural information relates to the natural habitats of tropical orchids
120	Amazing!: Whether you believe or not, this book is very hard to put down. Very riveting. Piper is an exceptional storyteller.
121	awsome: my bomber loves this cause rain makes corn corn makes whiskey whiskey makes his baby get a little bit frisky
122	terrible smell: I don't normally give products one star, but this scent is awful. I ordered black coconut, and it smells like some horrible mix of rubber and chemicals. Maybe with a hint of coconut.So if you want to smell like a car tire that may or may not have run over a coconut, this is perfect!
123	Sent the wrong color!!!!!: It would have been great except that I was sent the wrong color, and of course it wasn't noticeable until I had already opened it, so it was $20.00 down the drain!!!
124	terrible, super obvious info: My husband and I were required by our pastor to do this before we got married. We laughed through the whole thing. This was such a waste of time, most of the info is just common sense stuff. the illustrations are super lame and cheesy. Also, throughout the book the author continues to promote and advertise the other books he has written.
125	New Life.: Il Giardino Armonico play with passion and expression that I've not heard in other performances of The Four Seasons. I believe they breath new life into this wonderful old piece. I own three other recordings of The Four Seasons and this is my favorite.
126	One important feature is missing...: I recently purchased Make it or Break it Volume 2 and automatically assume it should provide closed caption or subtiles but to my surprise, this volume 2 dvd doesnt but the first volume does. So why stop there? And plus I know that on tv, it provided closed captions. I am deaf myself and this bit of information would have been helpful.
127	This power cord FRIED my laptop.: I used this power cord for about a month or two before I started noticing that my laptop was acting funny and it was slowly not charging, also turning off randomly and making funny noises.I took it into Geek Squad and they immedietely thought it was my power cord.They measured the amount of power coming out of the power cord and it was so much power that it FRIED my whole motherboard on my laptop and now my laptop is NO GOOD.It's broken and it has not been able to be turned on since then.They said they were suprised I could even turn it on at all with how much power was going through it.It would have been nice to know that Dell does not authorize third party power cords or else I wouldn't be in this situation.Do not buy this cord.
128	Unwatchable: Man how I love the Vacation movies. I love them so much that I was able to overlook all of the bad reviews this movie got and bought it anyway. Simply put, it was painful to watch and I forced myself to sit through it hoping it would get better. It really is as bad as the others say and ranks among the worst movies I've ever sat through and I'm not picky. I've turned off much better movies for being unwatchable. Made-For-TV isn't even a good excuse because it's not even good enough for that. I had hope that Cousin Eddie could salvage this mess, but he couldn't. At least in the others, the disasters were in the movie and not the movie itself. I give it one star for participation and pity only.
129	You can have mine for free, if you dig it out of the garbage: This Iced Tea maker is an absolute joke! No, I take that back. A joke would be humorous. This is just a piece of garbage. Every time I made it, no matter how I positioned the tea pitcher, it dumped tea all over the counter while it was brewing. I would watch it and make sure it was aligned up, but about after about half-way through, I guess the cup would start dumping tea so fast, it would pour all over the counter.What ever happened to quality products? I'm sick of these pieces of junk getting put on our store shelves!
130	springy: Nothing against the product, I'm just an idiot. Apparently there are different lengths of cheese slicer wires and this one was too long for my marble one. I fudged it to work but the slicing is weak. I had to buy another cheese slicer.
131	HOT DAMN THIS BOOK IS GOOD: THIS BOOK WAS SO SO SO SO GOOD I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN FOR ONE SECOND.THE ONLY NEGATIVE THING I HAVE TO SAY IS WHO EDITED THAT BOOK THEIR WERE SO MANY MISTAKES.
132	Difficult to buy a musical instrument online I suppose...: The nut was too low on the guitar causing nothing but BUZZ, BUZZ, BUZZ. This was a Christmas present for my eight-year-old daughter, and I was disappointed for her even though she tried to act like she liked it. The company who makes this thing should do better quality control. Anybody would have known this particular one was no good. In the twelve years I've been ordering things from Amazon this is my first disappointment. I had good luck with a ukulele I ordered through Amazon but will probably not order instruments online again. By the way, I went to a local music store two days after Christmas and we picked out a great-sounding starter guitar that she loves!
133	LA Confidential, unconfidentially is the best.: I was really surprised to realize that I had ordered a two-disc Special Edition. I am very pleased with my purchase and have no complaints especially considering the price that I paid. What a great find!! I like to watch good movies over and over again and this is one of the great ones. After placing the order, I received it in such a quick that I never had time to wonder when it would get here. I do refer my friends to this site for purchasing movies that cannot be found in other stores. They also have had good experiences with Amazon.
134	something for everybody, especially if you are new to frugality: Not everyone will agree with everything in this book (I sure didn't). However if you are buying this book you likely are looking for ways to save money, maybe to accomplish some financial goal. This book emphasizes empowerment in managing your finances and then gives thousands of ways this can be accomplished in your life. I am a young professional and I found this book very useful.
135	Finally,it all makes sense: Started to watch this show from season four. so decided to watch From the beginning .could find it only on Amazon .I like it .love the characters and finally makes sense to me a lot of things that come along later .i'll keep watching
136	Consistently beautiful collection of songs: This collection of songs is from many genres. There are a few cajun tunes, blue grass songs, and a pop song. Even though the background of the songs is varied, they are pulled together into a cohesive whole on this CD. The vocal harmonizing is lovely, and the selection of accompaniment is perfect. The people performing on this album are serious about their music, and it shows.The songs are all very smooth and on the quiet side. I suppose as if one were floating down a long slow river in the hot sun. I highly recommend it.
137	Holy Macro: I just got the camera two days ago and have been tinkering with it ever since. The macro mode alone makes this camera a worthy investment. I do agree with others that the manual controls are a little tricky but I figure if you manage to get a good picture then you earned it. I have not been disappointed yet by the quality. Picked up 8 rechargeable batteries and a 64 mb card and I haven't looked back since.
138	Excellent Value: Admittedly I have not actually towed a trailer with this...but it went together perfectly and I have no reason to think it will not perform just fine when I need it to. For a quality item with a well-known brand name attached, it's an outstanding buy, and I'm VERY pleased to have found it.
139	Didn't fit!!: These may work for some Keurigs, but definitely NOT for the Special Edition, which is what I have! So, it is sitting in my cupboard, because I can't use the thing! Instead, we were at CVS pharmacy one dat, and saw the Cafe Cup that's advertised on tv, and bought that. Works great for Special Editions!! They fit perfectly!!!!
140	Stinker: "Wheel of the Winds" follows three characters, known as "The Captain", "The Warden", and "The Exile" as they flee from somebody and take a journey around the world. They see a lot of landscapes and havea couple encounters with poorly described little furry creatures. And that's about it. Yes, the central problem with this book is that it lacks purpose. Although billed as a story about self-discovery, none of the main characters really catch your attention. As far as imagination goes, this book is seriously lacking. It's just too long and boring to justify reading it, despite one decent action sequence.I might say that Engh's dialogue is wooden, but I don't want to insult wood. The writing is just awful most of the time, with the characters simply pouring forththeir emotions and thought processes. It doesn't ever sound the slightest bit like real dialogue. Avoid this one, folks, cause there's nothing to see here.
141	Awesome, long, DIFFICULT: I love this game - I waited for it to reach the PS2 Greatest Hits wall before I bought it because I was worried about the deviation from standard games, but I was more impressed by this game than anything else with equal or higher industry expectations.The graphics push the PS2 to its limit with the combination of the colossi and the environment. The button configuration is unique and the story behind the game is (even without words) a totally new experience.I wouldn't change ANYTHING about this game, but it was quite difficult. I will admit, I had to cheat and look up a few internet tips for a few of the colossi!5/5 - best $20 game I have ever purchased, and definitely replayable.
142	Still the same great rock classics of our time: This is Rods best album ever. Its a gentle familar beautiful expierence to listen to the entie CD. You won't be sorry in my opinion if you buy it. My favorite song in #3. It's how I wish all people felt about each other. It works for couples and is a great song for a parent to give to their child.
143	GREED, GREED, GREED!!: What a blatantly sleazy way to get Depp fans to buy this last season. What a marketing strategy! They must think the buying public is stupid! In spite of the one episode "Blackout" that Hanson is in (from season 4), I tried to watch the rest of the shows, and it felt like so much was missing. Ioki was gone too, and it just wasn't the same. They should have just renamed the show as a spinoff. Nope. Just wasn't the same.
144	At long last!: Fox finally released this classic. It was a favorite film from my youth. My only complaint is the commentary. My eyes crossed over again and again as I listened to Darryl Hickman pouting and complaining of how he was treated as a child actor. Come on Darryl, grow up. Couldn't they find somebody better to describe this wonderful film? In fact, as I listened to his whining I, for the first time ever, was not horrified to see the drowning scene. I was glad to see the little creep drown. Nice going, Gene. By the way, I echo the sentimentts of another reviewer who is wondering if Fox will give us Jeanne Crain's delightful "Margie".
145	Great movie: This is a classic movie, made in the days when if you wanted to film a big battle scene with horses, you actually used lots of people and horses. No CGI here! An absolute classic and great quality.
146	Groundbreaking masterpiece!: The production is flawless in every sense of the word. From the perfect opening "Angel", to the reprise of "Exchange", it never lets up! If you like electronic music or even rock and are looking to expand your horizons, this is the perfect place to begin...
147	jonathan livingstone seagull: 1000 for the musics of "jonathan livingstone seagull".I did have the lp, but today I don't have more. I have now a cd/dvd player for "region 4", and I am interested to buy the cd of musics and dvd of movie.How can I buy cd and dvd ?thank you,luiz
148	Nice Little Teakettle, But No Whistle.: This teakettle is not really 17 quarts, but you probably knew that. It's 1.7 quarts, which is not very big. It's a very pretty kettle, but I do miss having a whistle. You really have to keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't boil dry! I even set a timer when I put it on to boil. It does seem to be well made for the price and is easy to pour out of.
149	Rich & compelling mix of lyrics & melodies makes it a hit: I highly recommend this debut CD from Chris Ellis, which is about as diverse as it is compelling. With its provocative and timely title, After the Apocalypse betrays the artists influences -- pop, rock, and even country -- as the singer/songwriter evolves from cynic to sage in this ten song compilation. After the Apocalypse is multifaceted, intuitive, and eclectic -- a welcome surprise for a first album -- and will appeal to everyone who appreciates meaningful lyrics, engaging melodies, and a mixture of musical styles.
150	You've seen it all before, but this movie is actually worse.: This film is full of recycled scenes from romantic comedies in TV and film. You may not be able to pin point from where exactly, but so many of the shots are recognizable from actors kissing in the street without any concern of oncoming traffic to running away in the rain after pouring their hearts out. If I had one word to describe this film it would be "silly." In order to justify the lead character cheating with her best friend's fiancé, the best friend must become a self-centered cheater herself. Apparently this is supposed to help sway the audience into rooting for the 2 original liar/cheaters? Nice try but not all people are that shallow. We should have left when it started getting ridiculous (about 20 minutes into the film) but in some weird way we wanted to stick around to see if it could get any worse. Well, we weren't disappointed; the film is one of the worst I have ever seen! A shame since I do like some of the actors.
151	keep your 20 bucks: This add on was a waste of money. It claims it comes with over 60 new objects, but that is deceptive since each different variation of an object counts as one. The new items aren't that great, maybe the castle kid's room is cute, but that's about it. And the new clothes are not anything exciting, either. So save your money and download stuff from the web that other people make. A lot of it is free, and looks much better than what came in this add-on. I am pretty disappointed with Maxis for this one, hopefully they will make up for it in the next expansion by adding pets, which most people would love to see again from the first sims!
152	multifunction printer users beware: compusa salesman handed me the 2x1 switch after I told him that my printer is a multifunction, saying it was compatible. guess what - it is NOT. the one time I didn't keep the packaging - they won't take it back. the unit actually works fine as long as I manually switch computer cables. which defeats the whole point of a switcher.
153	Excellent Product Though Could Improve: Pros:- read street names can make you concentrate during driving, avoid to make wrong turns.- has battery as an alternate power source, can be operated by the passengers in the vehicle or without pluging the ignition keys.- fast satellite signal locating when start, save time when urgent.- fast calculating and recalculating routes.- nice looking maps.- good night-drive display mode.- good searchable POI database.- dashboard mounting disk included, good for CA consumers.- portable, easy to dismount and take it with you to avoid stealing.Cons:- a little bit awkward to on/off and change routing avoidness/preference.- speaker should be better for MP3 music.- should have full screen display mode of the photo viewer.- should have keyboard layout mode for inputing, don't like alphabet sequence layout.Overall, this is my second GPS Navigator. The performance is impressive the first time I use it.
154	Exactly what I wanted: This was a gift for my husband. He had this knife, but it got damaged and he wanted the same thing. Using the information from the damaged knife I was able to get the exact same knife. We are both very happy with this purchase.
155	Lobster? Chowder: Disappointed. Difficult to describe taste but it doesn't taste like lobster chowder should. Not worth the price. Will not order again.
156	Easy and convenient.: We got these at a great price, for about half the regular cost. These are so easy to just throw a couple in the diaper bag and go!
157	I saw the theatrical release...: and felt I wasted my movie on a cliche- ridden mediocre movie. Take your movie and buy something REALLY romantic. This will leave you cold.
158	3 Nights of Excellence!: This DVD rocks!Bruce and the Noisemakers have set the standard for serious listeners and serious musicians alike.Beginning with a interview-like approach, the viewer travels with Bruce to the NY Blue Note. Very candid conversations, play, and performance.Then, a stunning performance at NY Town Hall that will get you out of your seat just watching Bruce and the Noisemakers do their thing. Great improv, spontaneous remarks and play that are nearly as good as being there in person. The interaction between Bruce and the band is tremendous, with every talented member flowing in sync with Bruce.This DVD gives the viewer the experience of watching and hearing a musical journey that at times is sailing along smoothly, and at others is like a wild ride down Thunder Road! But oh so together!This video is a must for anyone who enjoys music, be it rock, jazz, blues, or pop, and particularly for musicians of any level.High marks for one of the best music videos I have seen period!
159	Another compilation book, nothing new: I love ELOISE (the original books), but this was just a repackaged book of quotes from the original books.
160	Footnote: What can I possibly add to the volumes of praise that this classic has so richly earned over the years? Frankly, nothing. Just an ironic and probably meaningless footnote. If you ever get a chance to see Stallone's cartoonishly over-the-top Cobra from the mid-eighties, look for our favorite Scorpio killer, Andy Robinson, billed alongside Sly as "Andrew Robinson" playing an uptight cop who at one point, when the rogue Italian Stallion enforcer goes to smack him, whines loudly, "He's the psycho!"
161	Beautiful Scent!: I buy a bottle of this a year, I have been wearing this scent since I was 17, my best friend Kara Jaques bought me my very first bottle. It was her favorite perfume, now in memory of her, I buy a bottle every year. A truly beautful scent and has wonderful memories attached to it!
162	OK, but needs help: This is a OK unit for playback and storage, but i don't know if i would buy another one. the controls on the face are poorly stenciled with their control function, which wears off quickly making each control unreadable after awhile (built-in obsolescence?). my unit is about 4 years old (nomad jukebox-6 gig) and creative no longer supports the product. i cannot upgrade either the drivers or the playstation software (2.5) which is needed to transfer files from computer to MP3 player. so what use is this unit now? i seriously doubt i would buy another creative product.
163	edges too thin: bought the 2.0 three pack, and every single one of the reeds came with the edges broken (useless) even though they were all in a sealed package.
164	Excellent Package: I bought this just last week. Amazon's delivery was on commited time. I was looking for a small, compact CD player that also have radio and cassette player. This Sony CFD-E100 exactly fit my bill. I have following observations to make for this player:Pros:1. Nice looks, compact size.2. Good audio quality, for CDs and Cassettes.3. Nice FM reception.Cons:1. You won't be able to preset FM channels without reading manual.2. MegaBass is not that effective (if you are not audiophile, it is still good).3. No MP3 support, this would have been great otherwise.
165	Finally: I like her idea of putting out a pop and a country album together because somedays I do feel like just acoutics and others I feel like rocking out but I wish she would have put all three cd's together and that is why I gave her a 4. I like the sound of the blue disc and if it ever goes on sale here I would buy it becuase I love the new sound of "When You Kiss Me". Peace and love to the fans.
166	Great Ep: this rocks they are right now one of the best bands out. Mirror Spirit is one of the best songs to come out in a long time. The only band out that is better then these guys right now is silvertide, and possibly Rose Hill Drive. Sounds like classic 70's 60's rock and roll. The singer has a great voice, I believe his name is Eric Shea and there lead guitarist is a girl but she can really play. Expect to see these guys again because this completly rocks out. Rock and Roll is here to Stay.down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.The DarknessJetHurricane PartyParchman Farm (Only have an ep out but it rocks and you can find it here on amazon.)Rose Hill Drive ( have an ep out but not on amazon. They toured with Van Halen and completly rock and the guitarist is incredible.)SupagroupTokyo DragonsYoung Heart AttackBlack Keysand the best new band Silvertide
167	More Silver & Gold For NY's Coffers: A typically effortless NY offering (and lapped up by the undiscerning public of course), saved only by the last 4 tracks. Buy "Harvest" instead.
168	Disappointing, couldn't understand them.: Very disappointed, not much of a story and couldn't understand Downey's accent, had to use the closed caption.
169	Not effective: I like Dermologica products and usually buy them from my beautician. This was very reasonably priced compared to her prices so I decided to give it a try. I feel it is not authentic and probably harms my skin. Will buy from my usual source next time.
170	Cats mostly gone!: We got three to cover our daycare sandbox. All the young cats we were having problems with are gone.
171	Absolutly has everything I saw on the test!: If you want to pass the TCP/IP for NT Server 4 exam, you have to get this book. I didn't even read the whole thing. I made sure and went through the review questions and I received a 938 on the test! I agree with the other good reviews "YOU MUST GET THIS BOOK!"
172	Still Struggling with the Site to Load...: Was trying to set up this remote, and since the manufacturer chose to use a server-based application (how smart is that?), it should have at least connected the server to a faster connection rather than "dial-up". I've been tying to set up the remote for more than an hour now, and and their site does not load, and when it does it loads with errors. (And no, it's not my internet connection; all the other sites load in a few seconds) What a waste of time and money!
173	Trade Empire: A wonderful concept, but demands too much detail management. Very confusing to manage, and I believe that this game was not beta tested very thoroughly. Don't buy it.
174	buy hardware mounted: my mother purchased this gate because she didnt want to put holes in the wall, and it is similar to the hardware mounted gate i own and love. the one she bought is a piece of crap, after trying to put it up for 10 minutes, and it still isnt secure.
175	Excellent read: Received this book from a friend and really enjoyed it. Mayhew is a DA with a frigid demeanor that is melted by a detective with a great family and pain of his own. Oh by the way, a serial killer is on the loose killing people that have gotten away with sexual offenses by the courts. Story is written where you want to turn page to figure out the clues and also to see how the romance between DA and Detective works out. He is one sexy man. Ordering another book by Karen Rose hoping this isn't a one trick pony writer.
176	BEST BAND AND BEST ALBUM IN THE WORLD!: BEST BAND AND BEST ALBUM IN THE WORLD! HAS GREAT SONGS AND SOUNDS. DESERVES TO SELL BILLIONS OF RECORDS. AND IS BETTER THAN THE OLD BANDS OUT THERE. GO AND BUY IT NOW!
177	Questions good, physical quality bad: The questions in this version of Trivial Pursuit are a lot of fun, and not always as easy as one might think. However, I am vastly disappointed in how cheap the game board and pieces are. I am comparing this to the Master's Edition I have been playing, in the collector's tin. For the price that I paid I expected a lot higher quality than a flimsy board with no pictures and dull coloring.
178	Perfect for a journal: I use this notebook for my journal. And since the pages are blank, the "reading level" comment isn't necessary. I love being free to write down whatever's on my mind. With free, independent spirits like *NSync, it's easy to do that in this notebook.I bought this because I needed a new journal and I love *NSync, but since the journal has a hard cover and is spiral bound, the pages stay open easily and it doesn't get damaged. Both are bonuses to purchasing this notebook. I definetly recommend it.
179	Three Happy Chinchillas: My three chinchillas are pretty happy with this toy -- they like to steadily nibble through the wood pieces in between eating and napping. Generally this toy lasts for about a week or so before they need another toy, which is about the average amount of time that most toys lasts with them.The only thing with this toy is that once they've bitten through enough of it, the smaller pieces tend to get lost and they don't get a chance to chew them before the cage is cleaned. Still, it's fun to watch the little guys inspect this toy and nibble on it together.
180	Absolute Garbage...: I rented this movie and stopped it not even halfway through...not worth reviewing, but what a piece of absolute garbage.
181	Give it up already you old hag: Im sorry, but the last person to be trying to make a statement about society is Madonna. She has made a fortune off exposing herself. Now I think her manager and agent have informed her that her looks have gone south, so its time to try and be a "serious" artist. And don't get me wrong, i'm proud of her for learning how to play a G chord on a guitar. And yes I agree when people say that there wouldn't be any Britneys and Christinas without Madonna paving the way. NO KIDDING! They are following the Madonna blueprint to the Tee. I am a firm believer that MTV has ruined music, and Madonna has to be their all-time poster child.
182	"The Ultimate Guide for a Newbie to Com Programming": I've browsed the book and actually loved it so much that I spend 24hrs just coding...Delphi is simply Rad, gotta read this book all ya "Newbies & off-course ya "Old Programmers"
183	Ultimately a Dissertation on the American Dream: What would you do if you were offered a chance to make $15 million dollars in less than 6 months? Even if it meant doing something that made you feel uncomfortable. This is what John Grisham addresses in his tort filled dissertation on the idea of the American Dream.The main character is surprisingly sympathetic. I had compassion for him and I could see how I could be him. Through the course of the novel he changes as greed and a lack of love take over. What can save him?I also found this entertaining to read given my experience with the world of torts. Grisham again is on key, even not somewhat over the top (just a little though) about what large tort involves.If you enjoy John Grisham you won't be disappointed.
184	A delightfully illustrated story which is ideal for children ages 3 to 7: Charmingly written and colorfully illustrated by Ruth Alloway, Clumsy Crab is the picturebook tale of Nipper, a loveable crab with huge, clumsy claws. No matter what games Nipper plays with his friends, those claws always get in the way! So the friends decide to play hide-and-seek (which is something they can all do together) but Nipper's claws ruin his hiding place! So instead, Nipper looks for his friends while they hid. He finds Turtle and Jellyfish, but there's no sign of Octopus until Nipper sees that Octopus is tangled tight in the weeds. Now it's up to Nipper and his clumsy claws to rescue his friend! Clumsy Crab is a delightfully illustrated story which is ideal for children ages 3 to 7 and would make a popular addition to any family, preschool, elementary school, or community library collection.
185	bad: sometimes i wonder if Maltin even watches these movies... often it seems like he read the back of the box or watched a preview... very rarely do i ever agree with his ratings... even though i don't alway agree with Ebert, i find his reviews much more informative and intelligent
186	Alien Abduction: If you're looking for proof that alien abduction is and has been a REAL THING, forget it. If you're looking for a movie that makes it seem like alien abduction has finally been discovered as the real thing, you might enjoy this movie. The movie is filmed as if it's switching between scenes with actors from the movie and scenes of actual psychiatric sessions of patients who have been hypnotized and go through the buried memories of their abductions by aliens. In the genre of exciting sci-fi, this is an enjoyable movie, but don't watch it expecting to find "the truth out there."
187	Works, but methods are not sustainable throughout the day: Like many reviewers have said, this stuff could have filled a pamphlet instead of a whole book. The five S's sometimes work a little to calm my fussy baby, but I can not walk around with a swaddled baby swinging in my arms with white noise following us all day. I suppose if my baby would tolerate the swing, these methods would allow me to eat a meal.The other thing that drives me crazy about this book is the amount of people who ask me if I've read it when they see me and my fussy baby. I've shushed until my teeth were numb, I can swaddle in the dark, and I can't stand anymore without rocking back and forth. Yes, I read the book!
188	Works well with girls: Two year old granddaughter stated it was soft to sit on. It fit our oval seat well. No leaks with our girl.
189	Pretty while it lasted: These came as described, and were great... For a few weeks. I used them for daily wear. Before long, the earrings would not stay clasped and the posts bent. Not worth the price, or the wait.
190	This toaster lasted almost exactly a 2 years. 2 Stars for Design only: I bought this toaster 11/2009 and it went belly up the last week of October 2011. I always had a problem with one side screen not moving to keep the bread straight.I looked it over very well when i first received it. I was very impressed with the design but not the workmanship. Very Poor. Mechanicals are just cheap. I wanted to buy another same design but can't find one. This is a perfect example of a great idea gone wrong when handed to sales.It was built cheaply. What I might expect from China when they design their own toaster for international sales.I never thought the Hamilton Beach replacement I have could get worse, but it is a piece of C**P. Now I'm looking for a replacement for a 3 week old Hamilton Beach toaster that doesn't cook evenly anywhere. Half the filaments do not work. Does anyone make a decent toaster any more. It's such a simple piece of kitchen ware. How do these companies screw up so bad.GREED
191	Be very, very careful or it will become write protected: I will change my review if the company's support comes through with a solution to my problem but, until then, I just lost my money on this product. While transferring over data from a clunky external hard drive, some nice family member closed my laptop (to save electricity, I suppose). Turns out, this is a death-blow for the Centon DataStick. It is now completely write protected. This must happen often because there are several online forums on how to fix this problem. Trouble is...none have worked. I've even downloaded two other programs that are supposed to fix this problem but they can't. Why? Because the disk is write-protected.Remember when you could write-protect a disk by clicking that little plastic thing? Was that such a bad system?
192	disappointed: I thought this would be his piano playing and was very disappointed to learn that it was vocal. Not that I have a problem with his voice; it's just that an early cd I heard of his piano music was fabulous and I am trying to find it.
193	A Master Synthesis: Alexander has spent a life time studying (and building) works full of life. This is volume 1 of his masterwork. This volume can be seen as a very careful argument on the nature of aesthetics. However, Alexander is aiming higher than just breaking new ground in understand aesthetics. He sees the subject as being inextricably linked with the nature of life itself.This is a book people may well be studying two hundred years hence.
194	Timeless: Nobody grabbed the English uppercrust like P.G. Wodehouse. Yes, it is written with the vernacular of the time, but there's no trouble following and the belly laughs flow flawlessly. Before you read this collection, you may think about seeing the video collection of 'Jeeves and Wooster,' starring House's Hugh Laurie. Well done and gives you a sense of time and place, so when you read the P.G. Wodehouse stories, you'll fit right into the humor.
195	Buy it!: Buy this book.Roxie Munro is a good artist.I read amusument park from Roxie Munro.I like Roxie Munros books it is fun!.
196	Great book for general understanding and basic knowledge of metals and how they are worked.: Great book for general understanding and basic knowledge of metals and how they are worked. Covers lots of neat subjects that are great to know and touches even on metallurgy and overall good solid book as an overall intro
197	Park Tool HMR-2: It is fine. Used it to disassemble my rear hub which was shot. Looks like the rubber strike surface could be changed if it wore down. It just threads on with a bolt.
198	Don't Waste Your Money: Just received this item......Campy: 10/10Substance: 1/10Only value was a very basic section on greetings. Not enough real world "cover to cover" substance to justify the cost. I will be returning this item asap.
199	Badly Needs Editing: Mr, Folsom can certainly write a sentence and string them into interesting paragraphs. So can any competent English major. I padded through 400 of the 700+ pages before deciding it was too dirty and implausible to continue further. Moreover, because of his Clintonian descriptions of sex I will not pass this on to my wife and certainly not my adult daughters. I cannot in good conscience donate it to the library and must throw it to the shredder. Needless to add that I will not by purchasing any more of Mr. Folsom's books in the future.
200	Extremely positive and uplifting!: This book was ordered as an ebook from Amazon after having watched Squire Rushnell on The 700 Club. I knew after hearing a few of the experiences he revealed that I would enjoy reading his books. I have NOT been disappointed. I will be reading ALL of his other books by similar titles.
201	Refurbished? NOT!: I recently purchased the Refurbished LRM-519. Upon hooking it up and trying to set it up I discovered all the previous owners information was still in the unit. After trying to enter in my own information for an hour I packed it up and sent it back. Why call a unit refurbished and not reset the startup wizard?
202	1 Year warrenty; which is slightly less than how long it lasts: Used the product for about a year; fairly simple to use. Hardware failed a little after the warranty ran out. Good while it lasted, but doesn't last.
203	Woo Hoo!: I used to play this CD for my pre-school class. It was difficult to tell who enjoyed it more... the children or their teachers. It is a great journey and story told through song. Lovely and fun! I am glad to have found the CD available for purchase here. I will use it with my 2nd graders as an interesting example of story telling. Help your students/children develop phonemic awareness(the abilty to hear and recognize sounds) by reading/ playing stories for them!
204	Fiskars 9124 Professional Bypass Pruning Shears: It's sharp and cuts well but had difficulty opening them the 1st time and am unable to re-close them as the 'catch' is off a little bit.
205	Poor Quality DVD for a great film: I love this movie and was delighted to find it on DVD. I took it home to watch and was horrified to find scenes were cut short and dialogue was missing, most scenes were very grainy and the sound was terrible. Save some money and buy it on VHS. Be sure to buy the John Wayne Estate Authorized Edition for the best quality. DO NOT buy this great movie on DVD you will be disappointed at the quality!!
206	THE WIERD BOOK: The book was a pretty good book. It was more exciting then I thought it would be less more adventures. It was a good book but it would be better if they were saving people other that buffalo. I mean come on what bunch of 13 and 15 year old kids are going to be trying to save a batch of buffalo? The characters in the book were good described, and they were well fit for the spot in the book. The setting in the book was well played out by the author. The flashbacks in the book were kind of awkward. Some of them really had no point to them. The point of view in the book was told well because it wasn't in any of the characters point of view. Well John Cotton was there leader and they followed him like he was a god. They did that because he was the oldest and he took the part in being the leader. So that is what I have to say about the book!!
207	thomas fun at a lower price: good fun. too many pieces for us this year, but they are slowing making their way to the table.worse part is keeping it together. going to get some plywood and small wood screws to stabilize the tracks and they don't fit as snugly as I would prefer.our terror, likes terrorizing it and I'm constantly rebuilding
208	Disappointing: I recenty had hip replacement surgery and am unable to bend over very far or cross my leg to clip my toe nails. I did a search for "long handeled toe nail clippers" and this item came up. They are not really very long---and the blades are too wide to be of much use for toe nails. They also are not as sharp as regular nail clippers. So---I am glad they were not that expensive---because they are useless to me.
209	This is why we love 10,000 Maniacs: Their fourth major label effort (not counting Hope Chest); the fourth reason why we love them. This release has a more upbeat feeling than their last, Blind Man's Zoo. The last couple of songs are less impressive than the first couple, the reason it's a 4 star instead of 5 star effort.
210	great book: Its a great book for the price with tons of information that you could add to your collections.I highly recommend this to everyone!
211	the Best Yet: a great combination of rock classic and blues, this steppenwolf album is 1 of their best if not the best. great Riffs and Hits form Snowblind Friend to the title trac earshplittenloudenboumer..a must have for any collection
212	It just works: This thing just works. No experience needed. However, I can not test if it works to 1Gbps. Hopefully it does.
213	Very Thin Plastic: These trays are made of a very thin plastic that is similar to the kind used for packaging. I was expecting something thick and durable like the trays that you can get in office supply stores. These are very flimsy and could be easily pierced with a letter opener or even cut with scissors.
214	Why I enjoyed reading this book: It lists lots of ideas of what you and your family can do on the holidays, feast days and special occasions. The book also includes specific recipes for that hoilday, the book lists prayers that every Catholic should know such as the Hail Mary and Our Father. The book also talks about important saints in our Catholic history.
215	Perfect fit for Blackjack 2; Good value: I received the case quickly after ordering it and it appears exactly as the pictures on the product page. My new Blackjack 2 fits perfectly in this case. The belt clip is a heavy duty clip and stays on my belt just fine. The magnetic clasp works well; it closes easily, stays closed, and opens without too much effort. The material is of high quality and looks great.Overall this leather phone case is a very good value for the price. I've used it for over a month now and it still looks and functions as good as new.
216	Great Read, good book: After the main character survives a car accident where he was plunged into not only the depths of a frozen river, but the depths of his own mind. The main character become strangely connected wit a serial killer and he is left to try to figure out why. The connection continues to deepen as the story build and it starts to drive him insane with all the odd images he has running through his head. the man becomes possessed with stopping the other that he is sure is real and continues to find different leads that are bringing them closer together.After his family is brought into the twisted world of the serial killer the main character is forced to find him as quickly as possible. The serial killer thinks of himself as an artist that works in the medium of human flesh and believes he is possessed by a demon. The ending is a surprise that I did not see coming and the final showdown is worth reading the book for it's self.
217	This is the WORST album the Beastie Boys have done!: I love the Beasties, and have 4 other albums of thiers, including ILL Communication which I love. But Paul's Boutique is a definate disappointment! I love the Dust Bros. But how pissed I was with almost every song on this album. The Dust's could have done a better job. The Beasties could have too. But (...), every one else I talk to recommends this album. So I made sure I listened to it 3 times. Still, only 2 songs at the most were fair.Peace
218	Possibly the worst horror movie ever made: The Cabin in the Woods was absolutely horrible, possibly the worst horror movie ever made, especially the last 30 minutes were ridiculous. Absolute waste of money!
219	It's a streeeeetch!: Quite a chore to combine elements of mystery, time travel, and romance. As someone else wrote "the romance seems to come out of nowhere," but I will say the sex scenes are fairly hot. The book works, sort of, as escape from reality literature. The ending is of the "feel good" variety.
220	Good, but self-conscious: Emma Forrest writes an insightful trip into the world of Viva. Through her take on Manny, her gay uncle guardian, to her obsession a musician she met once, to her reasoning for skipping her exams (she didn't feel like sitting for them), Forrest immerses the reader in the world of this 16-year-old. You might not always like where her path leads, but you always know how she got there and why. Forrest captures the self-conscious confusion of 16 beautifully. The one weakness I found in the book was in Viva's voice. While Forrest was able to tap into the mind of a 16-year-old, she overdid it a bit. Sixteen-year-olds are incredibly and painfully aware of their surroundings and their lives, but Viva is self-consciously self-conscious at times. The problem lies not in the elocution, but in the nuance. In its entirety, an excellent read.
221	Great for Travel: Bought this for my wife a few years ago and since then we've brought it to over a dozen countries and states as its ability to fold and fit in a carry on or small bag make this cane very utilitarian. It's sturdy, well constructed and offers a wide variety of replaceable handles to suit needs.
222	boo: This book was terrible; I don't know what the reviewers below are thinking. An impressive first novel for a 22-year old? Hardly. I would say it's more on a par with a 14-year old's high school creative writing assignment -- rife with crappy dialogue, poorly drawn characters, and an unnecessarily sensational ending. What second-rate publishing company printed this drivel (and failed to catch all of the typos)??
223	Nader's Despicablility is On Display Here: This book from Ralph Nader, George Bush's best ally and secret weapon, shows why the great New York Times writer Thomas Friedman has accurately described Nader as a creature of the lunatic fringe of American politics. Nader's connection to reality is extremely tenous. He is a latter-day Luddite, and his proposals have no chance of ever being adopted. This is why he has chosen the role of spoiler. If he can't be President, he reasons, why should Al Gore? Better to let a right-wing monster like George W. Bush become President and destroy the country!
224	SO narrow: These are so incredibly narrow. I waited too long to return them so I ended up giving them away. I've heard now from another friend to buy mens Rainbows if your feet aren't narrow.
225	Ok for DS: While this certainly wasn't her worst novel, it isn't much more than ok. I got the impression she had written an outline then filled with book with annoying, repetitive details - about the people, the house, etc. And oh, just once can't someone in her novel be happy being single??
226	Bet you never thought about this...: This printer pulls enough power to make the lights flicker in my mom's house. Admittedly, the house's wiring is old. But this printer says it needs 7.7 amps (that's what the tag on the back says, not what Brother's web site says), while the comparable HP printer uses 2.2 amps. Even if you have modern wiring in your house or business, you might not want to waste that much juice.
227	A Quality Training Tool: I found this book and the accompanying training videos helpful and easy to follow. It is constructed in a way that the user can begin with the introduction and then pick-and-choose the material that is most useful to them. If you are looking at the .NET tools, you need this book in your library.
228	its a good movie: ive always liked roald dahl's books, so i'm always excited to see when one of them is made into a movie. i really think 'the witches' was doone well.
229	enlightened pornography: This novel proves that all the enlightened hub bub surrounding the great dead white thinkers, such as Rousseau, Voltaire, and Montesquieu is hogwash. The masses in the late 18th century were not reading these great minds. (...) The masses could not and did not want to get their hands on the now famous intellectual writers of their time. They wanted this explicit pornography to read. These books passed censors because they supposedly contained works of philosophy. This is what the commoners were reading and thus the enlightened heroes of this time priod probably did not have a direct effect on the French Revolution.
230	Continues X5 Perfectly: If you liked Magaman X5 you are going to love this game. It is set up the same with the same characters that picks up right where 5 left off. It was a fun game, and better yet, it was a challenge. The game only got 4 stars because it wasn't any better than 5 and Capcom has yet to touch X4. Fun game worth the ($).
231	not the one I ordered: I have always recived what i ordered, but this one was not ..I ordered the hi rise, but recieved one way to short to the ground..it was to much trouble to send back, Im too old..I was dissapointed as now I can,t use it..husband can , but I can,t..be careful you get the right product...
232	They Might Be Giants. Need I say more?: They Might Be Giants... the best band ever.John Henry was the first CD I ever owned, and I still listen to it today. In fact, I'm listening to it as I write this. Anyway, if you aren't deaf and don't own this album, you should be ashamed of yourself. Seriously.
233	Pure Luck: We are very dissapointed in the quality of this disc. The first disc we received had many bad sectors and wouldn't play all the way through. So, we returned it. The return process was great, and we had no problems. However, when the replacement disc arrived it also had many bad sectors and will not play all the way through. We don't know what to do now. If we ask for a refund, we only receive 50% according to the return policy, but we have paid for a disc that is not watchable.
234	Lame: Lame. Lacks thought. Sorry I wasted the money and most of all my time watching! My six year old daughter could think of a better story line. I want my money back!!
235	Microsoft - A NO for hardware: This Microsoft hardware mouse sucks. I used Logitech before and It worked excellent. I misplaced it and bought this because of brand name and I learned a lesson. The precision is very low. I dont feel comfortable using this mouse. Now I am using touch pad instead of mouse because my hand strains when trying to move this mouse to move the cursor. Logitech works on all surfaces, soft, rough, on bed every where. This mouse needs only soft surfaces. Dont buy it.
236	Avoid this unit or you WILL be sorry.: I think there should be a recall on this JVC recorder. I had the same problems as most others. VHS tape sticks in unit, door on VHS sticks closed, unit flashes 'loading' ( service center did repair that problem) and finally the service center said the DVD recorder needed to be replaced. I told them to keep the unit but they sent it back anyway. I will think twice before buying anything with JVC on the box.
237	Little of Mercy: Is it a thriller or a drama or an action movie? Well the truth is that it is not one thing but a bit of a mixed salad. However if you looking for action with a big bang then read no further. If you looking for a thriller which incorporates ingredients of deep and dark psyche of the human mind then this is for you. Ellen Barkin plays a cop investigating a serial killer who is preoccupied with sadomasochism, sex and ultimately murder. Ellen has her own demons to conquer from realising her sexuality to performing her duties as a cop on the heels of a serial killer. Can be a bit long for some, but if you into psych thrillers then you won't mind the length. The end has a major twist to it. Highly recommended for those wanting a deeper and darker psych thriller.
238	give it a chance: For those of you who are into the ska side of less than jake, you might want to avoid this album all together, but if you like the way borders and boundaries was heading, pick up this disc. It showcases better written music than the past, with more complicated guitar, deeper lyrics, and much better production work. The band wants to show what talent they really have. Don't get me wrong, pezcore and losing streak are always in rotation in my cd changer, but I'm not as big of ska fan as I once was. For those who dig the punk with horns style that less than jake has emerged as recently, go buy this disc. If you want the fast ska.....try another band.
239	Just Plain Silly: Read the first sentence of this book and you will either be needing read more or have an intense urge to roll your eyes.It's not the message that is troublesome here because there are so many other books that will be more worth your time that say the same things. The difference with this book is the messenger.Some channeled entity called Abraham? Get real. The practical information contained in "Ask And It Is Given" is mocked by the silly, new age way the subject is presented.
240	One of the Beatles Best!: I was a little skeptical picking up this album (I'm collecting them all) but since I've heard so much about it I decided to give in. Wow, that was one of the best desicions I've ever made. The Beatles are really at their peak. John delivers knock out hits like Dear Prudence, I'm So Tired, Glass Onion, Yer Blues, Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey, and Revolution. Paul also gets in some classic tracks like Back in the USSR, Blackbird, and Birthday. George also debuts While My Guitar Gently Weeps, which is one of my favorite George songs of all time. The thing about this cd is, it caters to whatever mood you are in. There is blues, rock, kid music, and a raw . anthem (Why Don't We Do it in the Road). The only thing I didn't care for was Revolution 9 which is just a bunch of weird John and Yoko tape loops. If you can look past that, The White Album is a fine purchase worthy of being in your collection.
241	The Director's version butchers the movie: The Theatrical version is actually better than the director's version. The story is told in a much better manner.Even the director's version is missing some material. Like at the very end of the movie, the Theatrical version has a slightly longer ending because you'll hear a narrator's voice explaining the conclusion of the movie. In the director's version, the narrator's voice is cut from the ending.The Theatrical version has a few other pieces that are not shown in the director's version.You're better off with the Full-Screen Theatrical version.
242	Work great: I've used this sensor for at least 5 years. I can't understand the bad press because this thing works well and is more reliable than any other I've had.
243	Emotional but the dialogue is too repetitive: I am a Nicholas Sparks fan, I loved all his earlier books, especially the Notebook and Message in a bottle.. I would recommend The Rescue to those readers who have not read his earlier books because then they will be slightly disappointed in this book... but by all means read Nicholas Sparks books they are inspirational..
244	Good for the money: These earrings are nice enough for the money spent. They are very pretty and nice to wear to work. I like them well enough, I guess I was just expecting something a little different after reading all of the other reviews.
245	Pay attention to the picture: I don't exactly know how to rate this... The product is fine, I'm sure -- but the product as ordered from amazon is not.I opted for the refund vs the exchange because I don't know what I'll be sent... Part of me thinks I'd get what's expected, but a bigger part of me thinks I will again receive what is pictured: two pieces of a three-piece grommet.
246	Great stuff: The songs on this compilation are great selections, the only problem is they are so randomly arranged. The best way to listen to Glass is by listening to an entire album of something, since each one usually conveys a certain emotional state that isn't captured with just one random song.this might be a good intro. for someone who has never heard of Glass before, but other than that, its best to just buy a complete recording.
247	New edition, tired ideas: This is clearly a book for those who wish to see the world only one way and are willing to take "old" articles as the basis. This is a text required for grad school---a diversity class. While some articles are timeless, e.g. Wright's "The Ethics of Jim Crow" that should be in any textbook for its stark reality; other articles have the appearance of something written 10 years ago for the New York Times---that may have been kind of "edgy" at the time---today, are but rehashed concepts that don't move anything forward as to social justice. Admittedly conservative in my view point---I am always looking to expand my horizon---it just won't happen with tired rhetoric. I will keep this book on my shelf to remind me of the close-mindedness of those who beg for others to open theirs.
248	Mythology for kids: This is a book of Greek mythology which I assumed would be for adults, but it's obviously for kids. It has stories of Jupiter, Venus, Juno and other gods, and familiar tales like Prometheus giving fire to humans, Medusa and Perseus, Atalanta and the apples, and more. I deliberately and happily know nothing about kids, so I have no idea what age group the book is appropriate for.
249	Investment: This is a book that anyone interested in design, philosophy or a laugh could not possibly tire of. Witty and intelligent, it is contains a wealth of information, delight and humour. It is jam packed with funny and inspirational quotes, random and interesting facts and philosophies. The design is fun and clever and full of all sorts of visual stimuli. This book will inspire you and make you THINK in a way that could hurt no-one and that you are bound to enjoy. Perhaps my favourite book to date.
250	This is great!: Mary has such a wonderful voice that you want to play this all over again after it is through. I can't believe I've overlooked this album for so many years.And what a fantastic ending. When I heard "This is Love," all I could say is "this is great!"
251	Cheap, a little uncomfortable and doesn't work: I got this hoping it would help with my IT band issues. Not only did it not work, but I had to constantly adjust it on the run as it has a tendency to bite into your leg if it's not perfectly positioned.I think the company paid Scott Jurek to use his image using it, that's about the only good thing I could determine about this product.
252	A book that you cannot put down: I read this book about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it. When I first tried reading it, it took me 3 attempts to get past the first 2 chapters. But, once I made it past that hurdle I got so into this book with it's wonderful cast of characters, the time periods it covered and the setting of a small town that was growing that I wanted it to go on and on even though it was a pretty hefty book, over 1,000 pages. I have just purchased another copy because in some move or another I lost my original copy. I am ready to re-read this wonderful book - January is a perfect time to do this - the rush is gone, life is quiet and it's a wonderful opportunity to get into a book such as this one that just transports you right out of your living room into another time and era and mingle for awhile with some very interesting people. I cannot recommend this book enough for a great read.
253	An Excellent Movie: I thought that Stuart Little was a great movie!Once you start to watch it you will fall in love with the cute little mouse.Stuart Little is an excellent movie for the famliy.After the movie is over you will probably want to watch it again.
254	Great result with hard drive upgrade: I ordered the Fujitsu 120 gig hard drive through Amazon. The supplier was ipremiertek.com. Although the product was good and I had no serious problems installing it, I considered sending it back because of the pressure of the time constraints for returning it if it has a problem. You only have five days, or there is a big financial penalty. I was lucky in that the Apricorn EZ Upgrade worked beautifully. Their software cloned my old drive with no problems. Initially, I wasn't getting the new hard drive totally connected in the Apricorn enclosure as I was afraid of breaking something. However, I discovered that I could wiggle the drive back and forth sideways only slightly (not much clearance) until the connector seated. Then the cloning operation worked great. The Apricorn product was not an Amazon order.
255	A prosperous time for the Ox?: I bought this book 12 years ago, and through the 12 years I have noted the good and the bad and have this to say. Where, I am concerned the bad was bad but the good was bad too. Infact, there were no good years at all! But, there were years that were not quite so bad as others. Though, I might add that these better years did not coincide with the predictions in the book. This year is supposed to be and I quote from the book "A smooth and prosperous time for the Ox. Luck will favour his undertakings and all his previous troubles tend to fade away" Well, may I assure the writer that this has certainly not happened. The book makes interesting reading for at least I got a warning. But as for luck in undertakings etc? Well, even I believed in Santa once.
256	Don't do it: Purchased this item to power an 8" MTX Blue Thunder sub. Hooked everything up, powered on the car, walked back to the trunk to admire my work, aaannnnnnnd POOOOF. She smoked and blew out. Good thing it only cost me $30. You get what you pay for, although i waaaaas hoping that it would work for more than 10 seconds.
257	what a bust: Child loves science and engineering, has made many catapults, siege towers, etc. This is cheap and doesn't work well. She built it, revamped it, won't touch it. Giving to charity or school. What a waste!
258	works but holds potential danger: The steamer works well and is a fast/efficient gadget that gets the wrinkles out. The hose gets extremely hot (obviously) but lacks any insulation or cover to protect. I burned my arm, wrist on it this morning...so beware.
259	Excellent: This book saved my marriage, I really began to understand my husbands ex-wife and her BPD, as well as how to keep her out of our lives with using the techniques described in the book.
260	Lackluster and Confusing.: I'm currently taking Physical Chemistry II at Cornell University, which is basically Thermodynamics and all of the related subfields. Although I am usually highly satisfied with the content that Schaum's Outlines brings to the table, in this arena they've seemed to fail at making things easier to grasp, and ultimately triumphed at confusing me beyond belief. There is no mention of the partition function, and other than the VDW equation of state, there is no discussion about the Redlich-Kwong EOS nor the Peng-Robinson EOS which we were required to know as well. If you want a review book, I would not suggest purchasing this one.
261	Inspirational reading: I found this book very inspiring. Duke has researched it very well andhe seems to have touched on a number of pertinent issues that mostpeople are not exposed to in the mass media. The fact that so much ofhis book is devoted to issues that are not in the media, bring homethe idea that the mass media is in fact manipulative and grosslymissrepresentative. Duke's book is very enlightening in thisrespect. The race issues in the book are sometimes rather extreme andI cannot agree on all of the points raised, although most of thefactual information is true. I think all people, not only white peopleshould read this book objectively.
262	Worst Golf Course "System" Ever: Don't be mistaken with the word "Automatic." So you're putting the ball. There's no ball or club included in this "set." You have to find your own. If you're playing with this set and you make it into the really large hole, all the ball does is go down the little slide (shown to the left of the picture) and stop. They did include a slide extention thing. But the slide extention thing is just a piece of plastic and is useless. So basically this "Automatic" thing is useless for the most part. If you are hitting the ball and goes into the "gutter" behind the hole, it stills goes down the tiny slide.This item is good if you are going to take a few shots. But know that you're still going to have to keep on walking to retrieve the ball.
263	Not really worth seeing, but don't pay money to see it.: This movie was all right, didn't deserve the Oscar, but meh, it was ok. It's a war movie that will be completely forgotten within a year, maybe two. That said, Nicholas Chartier, the moron who produced this film has waged war on Net privacy and neutrality. He's suing anyone who downloaded this movie and thinks that all peopl who stream or torrent films are thieves. Like Metallica, the guys a petty idiot that can't recognize the difference between theft and copyright infringment.I deeply regret paying money to rent this movie partially because it's a forgettable film but mostly because that money went to Nicholas Chartier.A movie best skipped, but if you're going to watch it, torrent it or obtain it via some other method that doesn't put any money in Nicholas Chartier's pocket. And boycott all future films he's involved in. Maybe he'll go away.
264	Not what I hoped :(: Item specs suggest that it can handle a room of up to 100 sq ft. Mine was unable to cool a 32 sq ft area. I was trying to use this to cool my tent by 5 degrees, and this couldn't do it. the overall design is nice, and if this thing could cool better (maybe a different kind of pad ?) it would be perfect. Its easy to use, The "swing" feature is nice, but in the end it was an overpriced fan with little blowing power.
265	amanda: Four weeks into the school year and the bag started to mold and smell. Not sure why I spend 15.00 on a bag I have to throw away. Not eco friendly or child safe!! So disappointed.
266	I returned my Greek DVD the same day: I wasn't one of the fortunate people who had an opportunity to see the PBS showing of Josh Groban's "Live at the Greek." I was one of the unfortunate people who bought it absolutely certain that it would be as wonderful as his first concert. I am now among the many people who stood in the return line to get my money back. Perhaps Josh Groban could have sounded better than what I heard on the Greek concert DVD, but it doesn't change the fact that this specific performance was the one that was recorded, packaged and sold. Since this is the place for "reviews," I decided to put my two cents worth.
267	5 STARS!!!!: after going thru a painful divorce with children involved i found myself lost, alot of unexplainable emotions, this book sat on my book shelf for months, as i passed by it one day i picked it up and started reading it, and all i can say is WOW, it helps you connect soo much with-in yourself, when ur feeling, sad, angry, u have all these questions.. i strongly recommend this book it's helped me cope and continue to do soo...
268	5 stars to balance dumb 1 star review: I've never used the product, but the concept is valid (bait and sticky trap.) The other reviewer gave 1 star to two different products for a bogus reason. Not fair to the product. This 5 star review is simply to balance that 1 star review.
269	Sissel In Concert - Another Good Thing: Sissel really has all good things: A beautiful voice capable of anything from popular to operatic, a lovely face and figure, and a sparkling stage presence. She is a pleasure for the eyes and the ears! It is too bad she spends most of her time in Europe, and it is usually only during PBS fund drives that we in the States get a chance to enjoy her artistry.
270	24 - Season Five is a WINNER: "24" is the classic good guys versus the bad guys. Each season is better than the last, and Season 5 is no exception.
271	Dr. Sanchez: I teach Molecular Biology for Biologyst students. This book has been a good tool to teach, because has all the main points that are need to know the bases of Microbial genetics. Other books are excellents but this book has the minimun to know and understand other books.
272	Poorly edited mess -- avoid it: I checked this one out from the library and managed to read it, but just barely. It is almost a textbook example of poor editing (both in terms of copy-editing - making sure all the needed words were present and that the punctuation was correct, and in terms of content-editing - making sure that the authors had something coherent and interesting and on-topic to say). If you want to know about the Knights Templar, read almost any other book in print -- this one is a waste of your time.
273	great collection: It's good to hear that we now have a Tori Amos greatest hits album. The song selection is great. It covers some of her best songs and adds some new songs. The DVD is also good since it contains live performances for her. I just hope that this album does not mark a slowing down of Tori Amos's career.
274	Better quality, worse coverage than Glamourmom: I read all the reviews comparing this top with the glamourmom, and ended up ordering one of each so I could compare them myself. I agree with those who thought the fabric of the bravado was better quality. But I ended up sending it back and keeping the glamourmom, because it provides some coverage when you open the bra to breastfeed. My cleavage was a little too exposed with this one. Still, a wonderful product, very comfortable and useful.
275	Good book for the hopelessly lost: If you're big headed like me and think you have most things figured out you're going to find that this book is simply too simple to be beneficial. Nothing new and nothing really beneficial in this book unless you're hopelessly lost in which case, don't bother reading it, you're hopeless.
276	Incorrect size listed in description!!: I purchased this for my nephew who has permission to use a backpack during school hours as long as it is clear. The one he had broke so I found this one and ordered it. When it was delivered it was too small. I double checked the size on Amazon and the one delivered was was not that size. I called Bag Republic and after reviewing everything I was told that the dimensions listed on Amazon are wrong!!! The only positive part was I just wanted to return the bag and get my money back. They told me keep the bag since it was their error and I would get my refund (which I received confirmation that it is in progress). I do, however, find it disturbing that they found out days ago that the size was listed incorrectly on Amazon but no one has changed it yet.
277	Good Item: Own a skating rink and have used this cd player before. Keep and use 2 at all times. Have used another brand and replaced it twice in the time I've used this one once. Getting another one of these so I have 2. Love the ease of use of the round knob to select songs instead of a button, much quicker and easier. Would purchase this one again if I have to.
278	disappointed...: Sorry guys but I thought your book was not comprehensive and it confused the heck out of me when I read it couple of years back. (John Sharp- C# step by step is an excellent book to learn OOP).I took this book as a teach yourself/ intro to OOP and unfortunately the authors didn't do a good job with their intended audience- people trying to learn OOP. Plus there were multiple bugs in their code, which was not helpful.
279	INCORRECT DESCRIPTION FROM AMAZON: AMAZON STATES IT PICKS UP WATER DOWN TO 1/8 INCH.BUT WHEN YOU GET THIS UTILITY BOX COVER STATES 1/4 INCH.I HAVE TOLD AMAZON BUT THEY WILL NOT CORRECT THEIR DESCRIPTION OF THIS PRODUCT.PURCHASED IN 2011 AND RETURNED IT BECAUSE 1/4 PLUS INCHES LEFT OVER IS TOO MUCH WATER. BUT I AM MORE UPSET WITH BAIT AND SWITCH.
280	delicious baklava: This was the perfect gift for Mother's Day. My mother has tried other Baklava but especially loved this one. She recommends it to everyone. It is a great gift and dessert for any occasion.
281	Professional Surveyor's Manual: I found this book left me wanting for more "manual" type reference information. It is quite specific to Ohio area standards for highway and boundary surveys. It is not a good reference for beginners needing a "daily use" surveying manual.
282	Great Mummy action: The complete collection of the Mummy. Nice films in DVDs loaded with special features, in a nice designed package...
283	Over the hill...: and past his prime to B-movieland he goes. Van Damme? Ho hum. Now free to embrace the old superheros retirement home along with pals Stallone, Schwarzaneggar & Segall et al, Damme(it)'s cardboard acting (indeed the entire flick) which delivers action that rivals a race between two slugs and character development, envisages twiggy-like thin-ness. Watch this movie as you would drying paint - in anticipation of fini!
284	A Top Favorite: Being a Kentuckian, I am especially partial to Daniel. Love the series. Wish I could get the rest!!!
285	Trashy, trashy, trashy: I started out as big fan of this series but I've watched it deteriorate with every new edition. These books are no longer humorous, they're crude and vulgar. I won't be buying another and I'm sad that what was once a clever and well-written mystery series has become schlock.
286	Please, please stop! I will confess anything....no more...: If I was running Abu Gharib prison, and looking for confessions from hardened terrorists, I think playing this kind of music for them would get early & complete confessions from all. No water-boarding needed!
287	Sucked.......: This cd basically was not good rap.....Ditty is pretty good though, but that is the only good trait of this album. Buy the single and don't wast e your money on the whole ablum.
288	Tiny Tiny Tiny - But cute: I knew at only five ounces this would be small - and it is. But I guess you don't need something huge just to hold creamer which is what I am using it for for parties and such. I wish they made one a bit bigger though.
289	She Said tops the charts: Excellent and catchy song. Makes you want to hum it all day......can't wait to hear more.
290	extremely unrealistic: I have read books on vampires, various were animals, and zombies and yet, this is the most unrealistic book I have ever written. The character's reactions are completely unbelievable and the author jumps from one character's head to another without any break. It is very confusing to read and annoying on top of that. I also read Midnight Tour by this author and will say that it was an odd story line but not nearly as bad as this book. Even the title does not make sense to the story line.
291	Blade does not lock to base and does not slice thoroughly: My biggest complaint (which is the main reason I returned it) is that you can't just pick the slicer up by the handle to move it. There is no locking mechanism, so when you go to grab the handle to pick it up (say to put it back in the cabinet), you only pick up the blade and not the bottom part. To move the contraption you have to pick it up from the bottom. The fact that the blade doesn't lock to the base is annoying, inconvienent and possibly dangerous.It also doesn't cut all the way through the bagel, english muffin, or whatever else you decide to put in there.
292	Great lyrics, even better voice!!: I bought this cd after buying songs from ally mcbeal. I wasn't overly keen on it, but it kind of grows on you until you love it. I'll definately be getting her other two cds. My favourites are "good to yourself" and "100 tears away", and i can't stand "dreamin" - much too 'pop' for me!
293	Realism at its best!: This work gripped me from the get go in a way that only a few other novels, such as "crime and punishment," have. Each time I picked it up I was astounded by the clarity and energy of Petry's writing, and found myself wondering why I had not discovered her work before. That other reviewers have found it difficult to follow the plot reflects in no way on Petry's prose. There are a few lengthy flashbacks which are integral to the books insights into urban culture. I did not find that these detracted from the story, as they were as key to the development of the plot line."The Street" is a great piece of fiction, that should be much more widely read. Petry makes a number of sociological observations that reach beyond the time of "the street," and remain disappointingly relevant today.
294	Astounding show!: This show is mesmerizing. The audio is phenomenal, and Eno lends everything an other-worldly and innovative air. You will not go wrong purchasing this if you are an Eno fan, and you will be utterly ecstatic if you're a fan of Rachid Taha! Their collaboration "Dima" on Taha's last album was astounding as well. If you're looking for a lot of Imogen Heap, look elsewhere; the footage for her single song is truncated, though the performance is good. It's just not much footage. The sleeper for me was the Nitin Sawhney performance; I had not heard of him before. Eno's work with him, along with a talented guitarist and percussionist, is nothing short of mind-blowing.And the message against the invasion and occupation of Iraq was succinct and heart-felt. Even those in support of the war need to hear this point of view. PS, i got a copy from Europe, so I really have seen it, despite its not being released yet in the US!
295	Actually, this book deserves no stars at all!!!: I bought this book about 4 years ago. After reading the book, I realized that Ralph Blum made up the accompanying meaning for the individual rune. Amazingly, he actually admitted it in his writing!!! If I extend his logic to its natural conclusion, I can take a deck of playing card, give specific meaning to each individual card and start doing some fortune telling on my own. This is exactly what he did with the rune letters.
296	Isnt it interesting?: How almost 100% of the people hating on Gibson haven't even read the book, yet somehow miraculously have an "expert" opinion on it? It's kinda like watching a Michael Moore "documentary," and then going around preaching on it without really doing any real research on the facts. Have we all became that bitter where intelligence has been lost in discussions and only pure hate of another "side" has become the issues?Sarcasm really only works if you intertwine hard facts people. Otherwise it comes across as anger and opinionated.
297	looks nice but software is very fustrating to use: the sony walkman looks nice and has alot of nice features but the software that you are forced to use to convert mp3's to atrac is very fustrating. I sent the following to sony:I have recently received a Sony walkman nw-e003. I liked everything about it except for the fact that I am forced into a license agreement to use software that I do not want to install on my pc and the fact I can not play mp3's but have to convert then using lame software. What were you thinking!? furthermore it is very frustrating to use this software and arrange my music files. It should be drag and drop! That simple. You took a great product and totally foobared it by forcing people to convert their mp3's. Time is money and you have already cost me more money than what your product is worth so I am returning it to get a real mp3 player. By the way, what good is to have the ability to hold so many music files when managing them is a complete nightmare?
298	Huge disappointment, borderline unreadable: I was greatly disappointed with this book. Rather than explaining actual science, it is mostly a mini-biography of almost every famous physicist from ancient greek to 2003. Maybe 30-40 pages in total cover explaining actual science. The rest is just full of irrelevant stories, mini-biographies and so forth.
299	Beware--NOT remastered: BUYER BEWARE--Based on the sound of the recording, the 1990 issue date, and the total lack of any mention of remastering on the packaging, it's clear that this is NOT a remastered recording. Still, the music is great (it gets 5 stars) and at $7 the price is right even for a old CD with primitive mastering. But I am pretty annoyed at Amazon for the false advertising, hence the low rating for this product.
300	This is a great cd: I heard a review on the radio and decided to get it. All the enthusiasm from the other reviewers here should tell you to take a chance on it if you haven't heard of Orchestra Baobab. I love well-written music of any kind, and this is one of my all time favorites.
301	Thank you for this book!: I think this book is great. I've been unhappy about a lot of stress recently (divorce, problems at work) and I really thank this book for helping me. I also thank Laura Hall for writing Conquer Emotional Eating and helping me get a handle of my eating.
302	Outdated: A bit outdated. Was somewhat disappointed with information in book. Wasn't what I expected or needed. Wouldn't purchase from this author again.
303	Light, Sturdy, Quality: I love that these shelves are already put together! Also, they are very light (I had no problem carrying them to different rooms in my house by myself) and very sturdy (they can hold massive medical textbooks just fine!). The best part is the way they look--I have 4 lining my study for the price of one similar shelf from pottery barn ($200) and they look just as expensive.
304	Fabulous!!!: Thalia's albums never disappoint me, at least the last two haven't. But between her and the rest of the other female singers out there ,she never tries to please anyone imagewise ,although she's gorgeous, she just makes great music with that voice. I hope her next album is just as awesome as this one!!!
305	The Best Movie Noone Ever Saw...: This movie is hysterical. No other word can adequately describe this movie. John Cusack and Tim Robbins have excellent chemistry as two best friends. The handshake is enough to make you want to watch this movie. The one-liners in this movie are classic. Perfect example: The fellas ask for another drink, and the bartender says, "Brothers Against Drunk Driving have been busting my a**. So you need to have a sobriety test." The fellas say, "Ok, ok what is it?" Bartender says, "Say the alphabet backwards, skipping all the vowels, and give me the sign language version for each letter as you go past." The fellas just whip through it like they do that every day. It was beautiful. I practiced that for hours when I tended bar...Bottom line. This movie is great. You will laugh and laugh and laugh, then be amazed that Wierd Al is in the movie, then laugh and laugh...
306	I'd rather have poison ivy than watch this movie: I was forced to sit through this movie; yes Alyssa is attractive and it's allright to see her half naked but being that she is one step down from a porn star - everyone has already seen that, so yes I was expecting her to be her normal trampy self again but you would think the movie would do something else to keep an audience interested.Instead you go scene to scene waiting for her to undress or if you're like me waiting to see the credits roll as the plot is girl comes to town; has sex with the first guy she meets, reads some old diary notes, then decides to become a homewrecker, then finds her morals, married guy who thought he was going to get some gets pi$$ed and tries to kill her.This movie was just downright awful and I still have nightmares from viewing it.
307	Great video...: My [...] LOVES these video's. He knows all about every JD tractor ever made. He watches them for hours and hours on end and learns something new everytime. He will spot a tractor on the road and will name it everytime. This is a great learning tool-not to mention when riding in the car he is so excitied about seeing "large machines" as he sometimes calls them!
308	A Must for Every Man Calling Himself a Free Citizen: Colonel Jeff Cooper compresses volumes of information into one well-written, informative, and entertaining volume. He shares his experiences and philosphies with the reader as a father would share them with his son at the fireplace.As a "Generation Xer" it is a great relief to know that this country will eventually be taken back by those who followed the Ten Commandments, read the Constitution, learned shooting from their fathers, and read Col Jeff Cooper's writings.Read the book and see.
309	Very difficult to operate: It is very difficult to operate. The instructions are written for someone who does nothing but plays with electronics all day. My son who is a whiz with electronics found it difficult to understand also. You get it working and the next time you do the same thing, it won't work! It's too late for us to return it, unfortunately.
310	Terrible cropping & formatting: This specific translation or just the version from this seller is or should be a publisher reject. I HAVE purchased publishing rejects before to save money on textbooks in college. I was not expecting to get a REJECT and am very disappointed with this. Be advised - shop elsewhere & buy a different spanish language version. The main problem with this version is that the book was not properly "Cut" and so many of the illustrations are chopped off. Also the text is printed too big and runs into the lines above and below a little.
311	Donald Westlake is always a winner: I had forgotton how much I like this author. He is always funny and manages to wind a story into such a tangled tale. Fred Fitch is a wonderful bumbler, always taken in by every con man. I did find the story to get a little dry in places, but I am still a Westlake fan, and I was so pleased to get this book for free.
312	john abdo xtreme: Well the arm rests will not stay in their holsters.. they flop around so you cannot get maximum impact from the machine. i am totaly disappointed with this machine.
313	Great romance with many twists and turns: As you read you may think you know where it is leading but quite cleverly it does not go there. Just as you think so many details have been revealed and surely the ending is coming then you note you are only halfway there but what else could possible happen. That is when the biggest twist of all occurs leading you again on another adventure. Enjoy the journey.
314	The continuation of Dragon Ball !!!: The first volume of DBZ is actually the continuation(not sequel) to the humorous dragonball series(vol.1-16)This one is really volume 17 in the overall story.The manga is vastly superior to the anime since it doesn't drag for too long the battles.Toriyama's original work let's you follow the plot,character development,and fights all in one package.I give this one four,because it only contains the first 10 chapters of DBZ and not twelve which is the average chapters per volume.The first two are in dragonball vol.16 since it closes that anime final arc.
315	Fabulous except it doesn't work: Pros: These phones are very cool, I hated taking them back. The list of features is the best of any multi-handset system and the product design is stunning. The intercom function is outstanding. This is the only phone/intercom system where you can dial another handset -- have the other handset automatically pickup -- and switch to speakerphone so you can tell the kids in the basement dinner is ready.Cons: The phones don't work. The sound quality when used as a regular phone is terrible and the speakerphone isn't that loud either (what can you expect from a tiny speaker). Worst of all the battery needs to be charged several times a day.I purchased a Radio Shack model that is half is cool, but the sound is great and the batteries last forever (or at least 4 or 5 days with frequent use).
316	refreshing: I first heard Goapale live and was sold from the first notes and its great to see the CD available in a wide fashion. This is the best artist I have heard since Res or Jill Scott in terms of originality and vocal talents. Anyone who is a fan of real music should buy this CD and spread the word to others. These are the artist we should be supporting. A MUST buy.
317	Clarification is required: Speaking as a Brit I can confidently say the author and reviewers of this book are misinformed. The majority of the British public don't hate America because of Bush or his reaction to 9/11. It's simpler than that. We just hate America because it's full of Americans.I hope this helps to clarify the situation for you.
318	From the old school: This is one of the fist Christian CD's i bought back in 95. The nostalgia that this album provides is sharp and strong. I loved driving around town with the windows down listening Scott wail and croon over driving guitar.My main complaint with the album has nothing to do with Plankeye...it has to do with the cheesy christian music reviews that compared them to Pearl Jam. Come on! These guys aren't in the same zip code as Pearl Jam! They're not really even the same style. But i digress.Plankeye is good, driving guitar rock. This album remains my favorite because it feels like it's from their gut. Add this to your mid 90's collection...you won't be disapointed.stem
319	Nice game!: I have to say that this is a great game. The graphics are amazing, especially the summons. This game puts together many aspects that create an enjoyable game for the public. First you get options, I dont mean sound and graphics setup options, but choices that make the game fun for different people. There are many many side quests that guarantee hours of extended play and fun. Between the gameplay time and the graphics this game would have been a 5, the only thing that brings the game down a notch is above view camera angle, sometime this angle makes it hard to see around corners or far off enemies that are on the charge. Besides that, great game
320	Going Postal: I am sure this IS an effective method, however later in life when the child is older I feel bad and afraid for the people or person who is around this person when they "GO POSTAL" from having such a repressed childhood. These children will not be raised with Love or will they be able to have any type of creative thought. What a shame that some people have actually bought this book and others may still. What a shame that these people want such subservant children. They say that once this is effective the children behave and they can have a happier more peaceful home but they are not concerned about the emotional scaring this will cause. If you want to beat your kids like a mule then I guess,sadly, buy the book, otherwise, please look for a more loving way to discipline your special children.
321	Star Watch is a must have book to advance your skills for an amateur astronomer.: Star Watch is a great book for your Astronomy library for those with small telescopes or binoculars with more information than several other books aimed at amateur astronomers. The author has done a remarkable job at introducing the wonders of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy for us to explore. It a wonderful book for any armchair astronomer and a pleasure to read.
322	Outstanding work - thoughtful, well researched, compelling.: Coming on the heals of the CO high school shooting tragedy, Diaz's book is even clearer and more compelling. This author, who has a wealth of experience in understanding the root causes of violence, hits the nail on the head in this excellent book.It is depressing, however, to read the numerous negative reviews posted for this book which are clearly written by gun fanatics and gun store owners and by those who haven't taken the time to read this book. Gun violence is clearly on the rise in America and the number of Americans killed annually by guns will soon surpass the tens of thousands killed in auto accidents.
323	IPod Speaker: Just got it today love it the sound is really good,I got this for my basement when i work out. Open the box pluged it in put my ipod in and i was pumping iron, the remote work's great
324	Great gift: I bought a subscription for my niece's 5th birthday. She's very creative and enjoys sending in art for the magazine's art contest. When I babysit, we always do a craft or recipe from the magazine, she loves it!
325	Too easy & the only shape I'm in is ROUND: I am NOT in good shape. I am pregnant with baby #6 and never quite lost the extra 20lbs with baby #5. I want to workout with hopes that I can take the weight off faster this time. I was doing Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred but got to the point that there's too much I couldn't do anymore considering I'm 22 weeks along. I tried Buff Moms To Be and first I had to get past the very annoying women on it. First the woman who comes on in between sessions then the actual instructor. Even the 2 backup ladies seemed bored. I didn't even break a sweat and I did about 30-40 minutes of it. I can do Jillian's workout for 20 minutes, sweat & KNOW that I got a great workout in. If you're the type that wants a laid back, fairly easy workout then this is for you. But if you want something more intense I wouldn't recommend it. I'm going to try the Perfect Pregnancy Workout with Karyne Steben along with some others.
326	Mishmash of the obvious, outdated advice, and some good tips: Most of this book is common sense (e.g. "Refuse to pay high prices for dirty, faulty, trashy junk that a seller is promoting as antique or collectible" -- well, duh!). Unless you're brand-spanking-new to garage sales or secondhand shopping, you probably already know most of what's in this book. And I thought the whole section on how to organize your secondhand treasures was a bit weird -- don't tell me how to decorate my house, thank you! Also, since this book was published in 1995 (pre-eBay), the "Selling your treasures" section is now worthless as eBay has completely revolutionized not only the selling process but also folks' newfound realization of the worth of their junk. Some useful tips throughout (the cleaning solutions section was good), but overall, not a book worth buying.
327	I love this ball.: The ball was perfect for my height 5'0. The pump was easy to use. This ball is just a joy to exercise with. And if you want ideas, YouTube has a lot of free videos with the ball. Can I say that on here? Anyway... Good ball!!!
328	Great teapot: Tiredof having the paint inside your teapot boil off into your water? Then this is a good oone for you. The only problems are the handle can get pretty hot and spout lever is a little awkward but not a real big deal. Overall were very pleased plus the price was right!
329	Fact....or....FACT?: Finally! A book that reveals the TRUTH about the tragic series of events in 1974. After all the hype, glorification, and FICTION over the past years this book tells you the truth about Amityville and the events that took place. The incidients that occured as well as the investigation itself, coupled with the writing style of Ric Osuna is haunting enough without the need for supernatural forces or demons helping it along. There is no hype, there is no glorification, there is no "shock" value. There is only fact, honesty, and integrity withing the pages of this book. I applaud Ric Osuna for his efforts and I highly recommend this book to ALL, and that says alot coming from the owner of a HORROR based company! Buy it. Read it. Believe it. This is reality.
330	stereotypical: this is the kind of mindless violent idiocy that people who have never played videogames think all videogames are like.how crappy is this game? let me count the ways. it is crappy in the way it's a third person shooter and weapons automatically lock on. it has crappy camera positioning. the animation is jerky, and looks like something for nintendo 64, not xbox. anderton's face is a mask of brutality.the premise is cool, the way you can throw someone through a plate glass window is cool (but the execution is nowhere near as nice as spiderman), and the heat-wave effects in the stun weapon is cool. all that adds up to is about 1 hour of basic training and gameplay and then utter disgust.
331	WONDERFUL!!!: These are absolutely the BEST pair of binoculars we've ever had! We love the fact that you can adjust both eyes for clarity, not just one eye as with most others. We can't say enough about this great product. We shopped locally to find what we wanted, then went on Amazon to find a much better price. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
332	Good reference: Good reference to some easy short workouts! You do need some items to complete, I was looking for a do anywhere, at home workout.
333	"bad": this is "Bad" its not even lp none the less these boy that sing it sound like there going through puberty, c'mon people this is giving linkin park a bad name. ...
334	Wizard of Math should also be expected to know how to write.: The device is clearly marked by the manufacturer as a function generator, where as the product name from Wizard of Math is Surface Mount Generator Kit. I have never seen a surface mount generator before. This could possibly be the world's first surface mount generator ever! I have my doubts. Serious doubts.This reminds me of Davie Jones' many jokes about buying a cheap device from a One Hung Low company. I will abstain from purchasing from this vendor.Amazon! For shame! If you're collaborating to fullfil the purchase order and giving the product and vendor the Amazon Prime treatment, you should at least review the product on your sight. Some thing was lost in the translation when you were blinded by greed. I am seriously considering canceling my Amazon Prime if this is the type of junk that qualifies as Prime. For shame.
335	BORING: This cd is so lame compared to their older music. I'm probably going to delete it from the computer. Not recommended at all, unless you like hardcore people singing boring music.
336	Stoped working after 4 months: After 4 months it gave an error message showing the there was no water in it when there was. Could not reset. Junk
337	Chaplin: Robert Downey, Jr at his best -- an oscar performance. CHAPLIN is great!. You'll want to see it again and again.
338	Hooked on Russell Watson, Fresh and Unique: I have read some of the NEGATIVE reviews written here and have decided that quite a few of them must have been written by the same reviewer (same wording and same repetitious phrases and terminology). You've made your point but if you will read the rest of the reviews, you'll find that you are CERTAINLY in the minority, so enough ALREADY! I found the musical arrangements wonderful and Russell's renditions of Core'ngrato, Recondita armonia and Vesti la giubba....perfection!! I do, however, agree that it's time for him to rest his voice before he does his 4th CD. 3 CD's in such a short amount of time plus all the promotional trips and personal performances certainly must play havoc on an entertainer's voice. I consider him to be a rare performer with a beautiful, powerful voice that is always "on key", such feeling he projects and such a nice demeanor with his audiance. Wishing you much success in the future. A REAL FAN!!
339	Easy learning: This is the greatest book. I put the stickers all over my stuff at home. I learn a little bit each night and find that I retain more over time. It is very easy to read and breaks it into small bits for easy retention. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who wants to learn Brazilian Portuguese.
340	Where's the movie??: The 1 star rating isn't about the movie, it's a great movie; it's about the fact that it wasn't released in the original theatrical format. It still boggles me that studios still release films in full frame, don't they realize that it is CHEAPER to release it in widescreen?? No guy panning and scanning the entire film!
341	Editing Help Needed: The story is intriguing but the writing is weak. I suppose part of that can be blamed on the translation. However, the book needed a serious edit to trim the flab and make the text readable.
342	great product!: Loved that I can organize my cabinets with this shelf! Now I can easily get the dinnerware that I want!
343	Power Window Switch: Matches up with 02 Monte Carlo. Only thing is the lights in it quit working after about 2 months. Other than that works great. Gets the window up and down which is all that really mattered to me.
344	Low budget...: This movie is a below average movie. You can tell that the budget was limited for this movie. Don't get me wrong, Gina Gershon does a good acting job, but some of the others actors just don't pull it off. The best thing about this movie is that it shows how unglamorous being in a band can be, and what hard work it is.It's too bad that this movie had such a limited budget. Gina does an OK job in singing, but the movie is titled incorrectly. The band that this is about is a punk band, not a rock & roll band. So, the title is very misleading. Punk and Rock & Roll are not the same genre, so it should have been titled "Prey for Punk".Gina is a good singer when she sings slower melodies, but she doesn't know how to sing punk or rock & roll.She is incredibly attractive though. So, if you just want to see her looking hot, then buy this. If you want a good quality film, skip this one.
345	Broken on the first day: We can not turn on/off the sound smoothly, or tune down the sound in the case when we "luckily" turned it on. The switch was broken. Waste of our money.
346	Good Tunes: This is a great album. She has some great lyrics and the melodies are catchy - especially the song "Lately".
347	One of the century's great singers: I'm not a fan of most country music--I find a lot of it manipulative and corny. Artists like Patsy Cline, however, are absolutely breathtaking. Her voice ranks with Billie Holiday's, and very few others as one of the most distinctive, soulful, and beautiful in all of recorded music. The songs here are wonderful, too--a concise collection of country classics. People like Patsy and Hank Williams should be played for everyone who thinks country music is bad. Like any other form of music, it just doesn't have enough artists as great as Patsy.
348	A ... waste of my time: As a teacher of English, speech and communication, I found very little useful information in this book. Some points were simply redundant and others held no place in educated society--[one] phrase for example were highly childish and derogatory. Additionally, Mr. Thompson's language and examples were often [biased]. It is no wonder that Mr. Thompson is no longer a teacher of English. The classroom is much safer without him.
349	Excellent Recipes Even Today!!!: I bought this book many years ago and haven't used any other. I make my own breads including grinding grains (Wheat and Rye). I don't buy bread very often (once every 6 months?) so this book has saved so much money, and of course, homemade beats store bought hands down. I've substituted olive oil or other fats for liquid lecithin which can be hard to find.I've used this book with two types of bread makers (I got a new one about 4 years ago) so the instructions work even for new machines.I especially love the Oatmeal bread (P. 60 and 61), English Muffin Bread (P.104 and 105), Multi Grain... Try toasted cheese sandwiches made with oatmeal bread sliced thick!
350	worse than falling off a horse: I bought this game and the playstation with my own money. It's a good game, but once you win it, it's horrible! the only hard part is the firefly game. Even my pro cousin can't beat it. I traded it in for the Emperors New Groove game and was GLAD it was gone. Loading was horrible, too. I'd rather have a real horse or fall off my friends horse. Get marykateandashley's winners circle instead.
351	Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: In one word BORING. My son is 16 months old and shows not the least bit of interest in this toy and I can see why. When I clean out his toy chest this one will be the first to go. My son played with it a handful of times and he was not at all entertained by it. Skip this one there is better out there.
352	Inexcusable: Dolly Parton's 1982 album GREATEST HITS is a poor excuse for a greatest hits album. What was RCA thinking? First we only have 9 tracks on here. On the cassette, there are 3 additional songs which do not show up on the CD, which makes no sense. "Applejack", "Heartbreak Express" and "Me And Little Andy" fail to make an appearance on the CD. Instead we have 9 songs, which don't even make up 30 minutes of music on this CD. There are some great songs though, like a new version of "I Will Always Love You", and classics like "It's All Wrong But It's All Right", "Two Doors Down", "9 to 5", "Islands in the Stream", "But You Know I Love You", "Here You Come Again", "Old Flames (Cant Hold A Candle To You)" and "Do I Ever Cross Your Mind". Nice songs, but overall disapointing considering her catalog, and the amount of music each CD can hold, this is not good. Save your money and buy another compilation which has all of these songs, and more.
353	Broken upon arrival: This store does a horrible job packaging their goods. I ordered 10 18" Euro Suit Hangers, and three of them were broken in half upon arrival. Of course, the poor quality was the main issue, so I returned the other 7 as well. Shipping will not be refunded, plus I had to pay out of pocket to send them back. Avoid ordering anything from this company that has potential to break. Their quality control is terrible, and they will make you pay for their mistakes!
354	Decent, not worth the money though: I purchased this for my XBOX a few months ago, and I must say that this controller is unacceptable. Sometimes while I play the joystick won't let me walk backward on Halo. Sometimes it won't move at all on some games. It I could go back in time, I would have bought a Microsoft brand XBOX controller. Don't get me wrong, this controller is worth about ten dollars at the most.
355	True poetry: After the first few chapters, I realized that I wanted to read this book aloud to everyone I know. I wanted them to experience Pearly Soames only photgraph, the first time that Peter Lake saw Beverly Penn, or skating down a frozen winter river with Virginia Gamely. I wanted to cry and laugh out loud. Where else can you find Praeger de Pinto, Craig Binky, and Reverend Mootfowl? Who else showed you the new millenium with the perfectly just city?I find myself taking this book with me everywhere, even after finishing it for the fifth or sixth time... and starting it yet again.For me- this is the most beautiful literature on the planet. Thank you, Mark Helprin!
356	best keyborad and mouse pack: I've been using them for 6 months, the keyboard is thin, resistent, ergonomic and useful. The mouse is a little bit heavy, but I love them both!
357	Perfect for the Audrey Hepburn fan: I ordered this to take on a long trip down in Florida, where I would likely have to stay in because of the ever so changing weather. As someone who loved three of the movies on here already, I decided I'd likely enjoy the other two... and I did! Perfect.
358	20 Principles That Matter...: An outstanding book that lays out in an intelligent way those core principles that lead to true success and happiness. Although the book is relatively short, it packs in a timeless message that can be helpful to all who are open to it. Ignore the snobbish tone of the professional reviewer; the writer simply states his case without a lot of hype as most writers of the genre do. The book was well worth my time.
359	Great beat, but you can't dance to it.: I ordered this book as a preparation for the Dantes DSST "Fundamentals of College Algebra" exam. There is very little material on the internet to help prepare for the exam, not nearly as much as for CLEP Exams.Upon receiving the books, I found the cover looked exactly like the picture. Inside, the pages looked like photocopies on heavy 30+lb paper. Pages look crooked and all the text is dark... some text is almost smudged. It looks like the original was typed on a typewriter.There is no "study material" in this book. There are 16 pages of "About DANTES" stuff, including the Fact Sheet for the exam. There are about a dozen practice exams (and answer sheets) for the DSST "Fundamentals" exam.You will definitely need additional study material for this exam. If you want practice tests only, this is a great book.
360	Looking for a quick start with Fireworks?? This is the book: My name is Johnathan Mark Smith I am a Webmaster and I also runthe Staten Island Macromedia User Group and I love this book. If you need to get a quick start with fireworks or need to find out how to do something, This is the book.
361	Alias shows his strength: This album is incredible and well worth the wait. Another fine example from Anticon records. Alias is great at mixing emotion with music and still having fabulous beats. If this tickles your fancy, check out So Called Artist, Deep Puddle Dynamics or anything else Anticon sells.
362	Works: I can see what some of the other reviewers dislike about the the lack of "glide" when you put it on. Somehow the formula is more of a rough deodorant style stick with chunks flaking off instead of gliding onto your skin. Other than that, the stuff worked great through saltwater, sand and sweat.
363	Battery did not hold: Sonicare brushes are great but this one the battery died after only one day of not being on the charger. We got a replacement and it seems to be working better.
364	No agile squirrels allowed: I needed to entertain my cat with a feeder that wouldn't be mangled by a local hooligan squirrel. This feeder, while sturdy overall, only lasted about 4 weeks because the hooligan figured out how to leap up, hang on and bend the hinges in a way that eventually broke them. Disappointing. If I didn't have this problem I would have been happy. It held 2 weeks worth of feed for the songbirds.
365	One of my favorite Bruce Willis Movies: I love this movie. I don't know why. It tries very hard to be a serious, black noir ganster movie and it ends up taking itself too seriously. But I can't help it. The whole movie just entertains me. Excellent supporting characters are as one dimensional as cardboard, but they fit the bill. So what can I say, I recognize this isn't the best movie, but I love it.
366	The damage is done: All I can say about this album is that if your expecting it to be heavy DON'T BUY IT!!! It sounds worse than "Saint Anger"(if that's possible). It sounds like what I would imagine Pantera without balls would sound like. Thats just my opinion.
367	Disappointment: So I get the iron, I use it three times and suddenly the fourth time it stops heating. I was really disappointed, I loved the results at first and now I just wasted my money. I cant get it to work again and I took such good care of it I'm sure I didn't do anything with it, it was like a treasure to me! So sad :/ I never trusted Internet shopping now I get the reason!
368	Great book, captured and kept my interest: I ordered this book to take with me while travelling and found I could not put it down! I finished it in two days of non stop reading on the plane and while on vacation.The author does an excellent job of setting the stage for the story and then taking you through the many twists and turns of a well-built plot.
369	No cover bracket, no thermometer: My husband will cook on no grill other than a Weber kettle, and we looked at this one versus the Performer. Just brought home the new 22.5" one touch gold, since we decided we didn't need the gas starter, the attached table or charcoal bin. The two features I didn't realize we were losing from the 10-year old kettle we're replacing are the the cradle-bracket that holds the top when you take off the cover, and the thermometer which was part of the cover. I'm a little upset that we spent what we did, to have those features NOT INCLUDED. Will be returning it for the Performer, I guess, but we're not happy campers. I hate to support a company that makes you pay an ultra-premium price in a newer model just to have the features that you've always had.
370	Never get my money back and very bad customer service: For the first time I subscribed to this magazine --- A few weeks after I placed my Amazon order on Nov, 2009 then I changed my mind and I cancelled this Redbook-2 years subscribtion.Then I got an email "Thank you for contacting Hearst Magazines" saying 'it is beingsent to a Customer Service Representative for proper handling'I checked back on Amazon several times and it's always shown up 'cancellation being processed'.I do get another magazine on same order and other one on different orders on Amazon as I ordered as well but I never get my money back or even any of one issue of Redbook!!!By the way, I don't like that they don't provide you any phone number and it's very difficult to contact the customer service by only mail or email contacts(which always say do not reply!).After three months that I never get my money back so I need a live person to talk with!
371	terrible: My iron also drips water out of the bottom and soaks my clothes before I can even get them ironed. I am highly irritated that I spent extra money for a product that claims to be wonderful and actually sucks.
372	Dissapoining: This album is incredibly dissapointing. The songs sound all the same, and it gets old fast. The lyrics are horrible, and the lead singer dishes them out in a really strange and unpleasing fashon. Stay away from this one and spend your 15 bucks on a good Rage Against The Machine cd.
373	A Wonderful Book in 2000 -- Must Update it!: I used the earlier edition of this book in 2000 and it was top notch. However, here in the fall of 2008, the 4th edition is not at all up to par. I have tried to visit many restaurants that have been closed for a long time. The hotel reviews do not match up either. (For instance, Hotel Shangri-la has lost its steam and no one should pay the upper $100 / 130 GHC it now costs - at a minimum! And at night, the restaurant and bar is filled with foreign men and prostitutes... not what most vacationers are looking for.)The cedi has changed so the book really must change as well. There are also many new roads and buildings.I would not buy this until they have revised -- and by revising they must come out to revisit and relearn all of the places mentioned!
374	Horrible: This Girl CANNOT sing what so everr and needs to continue with acting even though shes not that good with acting
375	Its alright for the money: I purchased this case to enclose a Agile Al-2000 I purchased here on Amazon. Overall the case fits a les paul style guitar pretty well but provides pretty minimal protection due to being rather thin. If you are looking for a cheep option for transporting a guitar in this is alright option but I wouldn't consider this for more than storage or for a minimal risk environment.I ended up replacing it with a hardshell case as soon as I had the money to due so.
376	Secular guide for what is generally taught in public schools: This is a guide to help you figure out what public schools are generally teaching and when - so you can build your HS curriculum around it. It contains goals per grade level and some book/curriculum lists that can help you attain those goals. It's secular and thorough and goes well with her more in-depth book (also similar in content) "The Complete Home Learning Source Book." I gave it 4 stars only because I was looking for a Christian perspective. If you want secular HSing resources, then Rebecca Rupp is your gal. She's very thorough. If you want a Christian perspective you'll want additional sources.
377	Brewing reference: John Palmer's How to Brew is a must for any aspiring home brewer. If you plan to buy just one book, this should be it.
378	Anti-breastfeeding, pro-consumerism: What a bunch of hogwash. This magazine promotes rampant consumerism, and it's absolute worst stance is that you can "simplify" your life by not breastfeeding your newborn. Breastfeeding is the most simple and rewarding of acts that a mother can engage in. As a full time working mom, I never found breastfeeding to be a bother or chore. Worse, is Real Simples' response to reader's critics of this article, from which one sample is "But one thing is for certain: it is never appropriate to breast-feed in public expecially on the subway. "What? It is never appropriate to breast-feed in public? A mother's right to breastfeed in public is protected BY LAW in most states. Get real.
379	mind-blowing: this cd is a must have for any accoustic guitar player/fan. i am a huge fan of fusion and indian music, and my favorite guitarsit is john mclaughlin. while all his work is good, and i have stuff he has done with miles davis, mahavishnu orchestra, carlos santana, and solo things, i think this is his best playing. i can discriminate since i am a guitar playing, and i feel that this is some of the most emotional and mind blowing guitar playing i have ever heard in my life. plus the guitar and violin compliment each other VERY nicely.
380	They Work!: I have had these ear phones for 6 months now and they are still working! Great buy and I would recommend it to anyone! They are not perfect and fall out of my ear occasionally, but they are good for the price.
381	italian charms: i've been wanting one of these bracelets for awhile, the price was right the charms are entertaining and i plan on giving a couple as xmas presents, amazon as always dependable
382	just ok: I've got a thing I guess for Britcoms dealing with the clergy (BritishClergyComs?). Just the title 'Father Ted' makes me laugh, I loved 'The Vicar of Dibley', 'Bless Me Father' was pretty good but I found "Oh Brother!' flat. I didn't find the star, Derek Nimmo, or his character enchanting which is ok if the supporting characters are well drawn but they weren't- at least for my taste. I'd recommend this DVD set for other BritishClergyCom fanatics only.
383	stopped working after about a month: the audio stopped working after about a month. and the video never worked for my ipod touch. very poor quality product.
384	Robert's Rules of Order: I also purchased this product because I am on the Board of Directo's for the Pearl Harbor Hawaiian Civic Club. It is incredible, and I will not attend a meeting with out it!
385	Phew - nearly made the mistake...: I was eagerly awaiting this game and was ready and willing to buy it *until* I discovered the built in DRM. What can I say - EA may have spent a large amount of time and money investing in DRM for this game, however, the payback is (as far as I'm concerned) one less customer. As more and more people understand DRM and its implications (the Internet generation is growing up) expect more of this not less.
386	Horrible Seller Product not as Described!: I purchased this product. >:( Firstly it did not come with any attaching tools like implied. Second it was only 1 protector not 6X as listed. Thirdly when I contacted customer service they were like "sorry its a listing error" and pretty much "screw you!". I highly recommend finding another source for this product.
387	Not for younger player-hard to maneuver: I bought this for my 7 year old daughter who is an excellent reader. This game requires a lot of reading and patience. I as a parent play all my kids GBA games, and this one was a bit challenging for me. The directions are somewhat clear, and the mini games are hard to maneuver. I think the game should have less reading, and easier to understand intructions. It was a disappointment.
388	Black Hills Gold Mother's Ring with 7 Gemstones: This ring is truly a treasure. The seller, Rich Peel Enterprises worked with me to fit 7 gemstones onto it. The gemstones are bright and clear and the pink and green gold leaves on the ring are a great contrast to the yellow gold of the ring band. It is in perfect proportion to your finger - not big and gaudy, but certainly large enough for everyone to see all the beautiful detail. It was designed and shipped instantly. I couldn't believe how fast it arrived. If you're thinking about something to always remind you of your kids, this is the ring. And you can fit anywhere from 2 to 7 gemstones. Whenever I wear it, everybody I bump into admires it!
389	19th century tarot pack reproduction: This tarot has beautiful pictures on the box. However, it was reproduced from a 19th century pack in Italy, not a 18th century pack like it claims on the box; thus 4 stars for misleading me! The pictures therefore, are true to the time period. Very pretty. On the left side of the cards are a one word meaning for each card. This may help you or throw you or your friends off. The word is in 4 languages up the side in red; italian, french, english and dutch, I guess. Pretty deck. Nice to have a "historical" deck.
390	Excellent Addition to Any Library: An excellent, readable approach to a sometime difficult subject. A must for any serious student of the Bible. Highly recommended.
391	How were Great Thinkers and Leaders educated?: This book gives parents and teachers a glimpse of what education used to be, what it can be, and what it should be, in order for great nations to have truly effective Leaders. The principles found in this book have changed the way I teach, parent, and even how I personally learn. Every parent, school administrator and teacher should become familiar with the basic principles of leadership education, and this is the best place I've found to discover those truths."A Thomas Jefferson Education" is a life-changing CLASSIC!
392	Buzz: The clock looks great and is large enough to see from everywhere in the vehicle. However, when the battery is inserted it makes a high pitched faint squeal, and is intolerable while driving.
393	Very disappointed - would like my money back.: The screen format of the CD practice tests is nothing like the real thing -- 4 or 5 lines at a time. I wanted to practice reading from the screen to get a little faster at it and this was a waste of time to even load the program. Also I thought the reading comp exercises from the book were incomprehensible compared to the GMAT-published excercies. I am hoping to find a way to return the book.
394	Smooth: I was a little skeptical at first just how securely this would hold cards. Basically I just wanted a secondary id wallet, and this functions well as that. If you wedge cards down far enough they don't really fall out unless you are intentionally shaking it hard. They can fall out though, but if you don't go out of your way to do so, they probably won't, provided you don't cram too much in.
395	Best Album of 2003: I am amazed at the number of reviews posted for this album. It has become my favorite and plays once or twice a day in our house and/or car. Actually, had to buy two as my CD changer loader/ejector is broken and you have to unscrew the top, and do all sorts of gymnastics to get CD's in and out....it was easier to buy another for the car. This is an album that gets better with age, it grows and grows on you. It is an album to sing along to, an album to play softly in the background and an album to listen to with headphones. All the songs are good, I don't skip ANY of them, which as I (and other reviewers) usually do. Measure of a Man and The Way are probably my favorites, although Shine is marvelous - well, darn - they are all marvelous and I hightly recommend this CD to all ages. I eagerly await more albums from Clay and predict his career will be spectacular.
396	Don't be fooled: This clipper set looks and sounds nice, Not the case. It is no differant than any other cheap clipper you can get at walmart. This clipper will last no longer than a year if You use it a couple times a month. I have been using clippers for many many years and have learned that you get what you pay for. Last time I used these They cut my scalp in two places. No joke. If you want a good clipper that last stay away from magnetic motors. I recomend The Fast feed by oster. This clipper is a big step up for about 15.00 20.00 bucks more.
397	BEWARE !!!!!: MIXER ARRIVED WITH A STRONG OIL SMELL. THE PACKING FOAM WAS COVERED WITHA OILY FILM. HOOKED UP THE UNIT. WAS O.K. FOR A WEEK THEN ONE CHANNELWENT OUT. SENT IT BACK FOR REFUND. PROPS TO AMAZON FOR THE 30 DAY RETURNPOLICY THAT INCLUDED SHIPPING. BEWARE !!!!!
398	Don't buy this book: I found this book of no value. It gives a brief, uninformative description of the different areas of the JBoss application server. This book left me more confused about JBoss than informed.
399	This is an enjoyable movie to watch: I like how this film has that vintage feel, but it still delivers a great plot. Also, the characters are so well done that you forget it's so old. Also, there are a lot of parallels between this movie and the newer version, which is kind of fun to notice.
400	The Disobedient Mistress by Lynne Graham (Large Print Harlequin): Description from the book back cover:Mistress in name only? Misty Carlton is shocked when Leone Andracchi offers to help her out of financial difficulty. Surely there must be a catch? There is ... The ruthless and sexy Sicilian tycoon needs her to pose as his mistress for a couple of months! Misty is compelled to take on the job. After all, Leone has asked her to be his mistress in name only. How hard can that be? But quietly, Leone is struggling to resist this beautiful woman he's brought into his life. She's gotten under his skin like no one ever before. Is it too late to change the plans he's set in motion?
401	A must have for any wingshooter: This book is fantastic and really helped me improve my technique and put more birds in the bag. Love the large color photos. Every wingshooter needs this book. Great for an introduction for new shooters or to help anyone refine their technique. This is really a wingshooters book as it covers a modified version of the English pointing method it will help you deal with most upland situations. This is not a book for skeet, trap, and sporting clays, no sustained lead used here...
402	Horrible: Bought this is June 2004. Was never able to hotsync correctly. We use outlook express, not outlook so that is part of the problem. The sales people at the store were no help and did not tell me any of the limitations of this product. The price was what sold me. When I got on the web site I discovered that only more expensive models will allow a conversion to outlook express. With hotsync never working correctly, we never transfered data. OUR MISTAKE!!! The stupid thing resets itself. We lost over 200 addresses, most of them for my husbands' business. Called tech support. Only have a 90 day warrenty, give me a break. Will cost 25 dollars for the phone call and 75 to repair. Now I have paid for it twice. And that is if I understood their broken English correctly! Don't buy this product. Spend your hard earned money on a better product, with a company that stands behind their products.
403	Faith Builder: Jesus said BEHOLD I GIVE YOU ALL AUTHORITY,,,,Luke 10.19 read the whole verse. LUKE 10.19Hebrews 1.14 explains the job of Angels who are our servants. God sends Angels when we ask in honest love.Good topic by author who lives what he preached
404	I returned this product: I returned this product. Because it did not fit my leg properly. It would slid down my thigh. I purchased the shorts for my hamstring.
405	Buy a true in-channel visor: I purchased this product because it was an in channel visor and it did not have the leg to obstruct the side mirror. What I received was a set of visors that were difficult to install. The right side did not fit at all and the tape was notstrong enough to hold the visor in place. I had to use an old visor that I had. You have to buff the felt of the window channel and clean it before the last preparation step. The last step is to wipe a preparation substance inside the channel of the window. The package that the preparation substance is in warns to not have contact with your skin, but there are no gloves provided to wear while wiping the preparation fluid on. Also after installing, it is recommended that you leave the windows up on the vechicle for at least 24 hours for the tape to adhere. I would recommend not buying this product. Purchase an in-channel visor that has no tape and do not worry about the leg that is in front of the side mirror.
406	RCA DVD Player works fine 4 me: I've had the RCA DVD player for about 2 years and I have had no problems with it.
407	Terrific item: Sassy Baby Powdered Formula Dispenser, Multiple ColorsThis small item is worth it's weight in gold! So handy to put into the diaper bag when you go out. Formula stays fresh and it's a snap to fill that bottle no matter where you are.After spilling powdered formula on many floors, I was so happy to find this!!
408	Not built to last...: If Amazon[.com] had a zero star rating, that's what I would give this product. I have had my machine for about three months and enjoyed it while it worked. I have meticulously maintained and cleaned it after each use. I recently detected a burning odor from the machine and it got really loud. I realized what was going on when I closely examined the parts. The blade basket is really cheap (gotta cut cost somewhere). The teeth on the blade that are used to grind and liquify eventually start to bend upward and actually start eating into the plastic food chute. Perhaps I just have a defective blade, but I doubt it since it worked fine when I got it. In any event, unbeknownst to me, I probably ingested small particles of plastic with my yummy fruit drink. Needless to say, I am extremely unhappy with this product. Perhaps they just want you to buy a new basket every three months. My advice, save your money and get one of the heavy duty machines, or you can find mine on ebay!...;-)
409	Okay Movie. Worthless Digital Copy.: "Digital Copy" does not exist. You can "stream" through Ultraviolet's crappy service. No internet connection? No digital copy. JUNK. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
410	can i have that 1:30 hours of my life back?: All I have to say is, for the sake of whatever thing you believe in, your family, friends, deity what have you. do not watch this movie... this is the most wasted time I have ever experienced and I wish I could unsee something. The only reason I rented it was because I liked all the other spoofs in this category... this was a walking abortion.
411	OUTSTANDING CD BY GEORGE: THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CDS OF GEORGE I HAVE EVER OWNED GOD BLESS THE CLASSICS
412	Slapstick and intelligent at the same time: McHale's Navy is a classic comedy starring the pugnacious Ernest Borgnine. With Tim Conway as the straight man, this duo makes WWII in the Pacific a "party looking for a place to happen!"This is old classic TV at it's best and rivals Hogan's Heroes for top spot in the WWII comedy era.
413	This is a fantastic purse!: I bought this purse at the low price of 10.95, and it is well worth double that...It's a simple design, with lots of pockets and room, and the best part is the zipper in the bottom which you open to get the umbrella out....I always have my purse, but, seldom my umbrella..The leather smells wonderful, and I'm a happy camper!
414	works fine, the cord is cheap: I've had this cooler for about 6 months. It started out working fine. Then after about 3 months the fans were making a lot of noise. Then after 5 months the power cord started to come apart. Now after six months the USB adapter on the power cord has broken off completely. When I first got it I noticed the power cord was very thin and cheap I thought it would break but not after 6 months of light use. Spend a few extra bucks and get something that will last.
415	Disappointed: I had been using a CoolPix 880 and wanted a smaller lighter unit for family pics as well as using at car shows. The c743 looked like the right unit and with Kodak making it I thought that it would do great. What a disappointment! The camera eats batteries even when shut off and in storage. I tried the lith units with only slightly longer life. I bought a pair or rechargeable batteries with the charger and the camera would not recognize them.Also, the camera takes so long to figure out the exposure and focusing that when taking pictures of children, they are looking the other way or out of the picture by decision time.Thanks for listening
416	Another Hughart Winner: No surprise, another entertaining and delightful Li Kao and Number Ten Ox fantasy-adventure. The grisly murder of a prominent mandarin by a mysterious ghoul provides the catalyst for this duo to go delving into China's ancient mythology searching for the answers. Along the way, author Barry Hughart creates some of the most curious and imaginative heroes and villains you will ever encounter. Just superb.Sadly, as noted by previous reviewers, this is the third and last book that the author has written in this series. On the bright side, the books he did write were all sparkling 5-star reads. "Eight Skilled Gentlemen" is a winner - just read it.
417	really should have seen this coming: I read most of this book and was skeptical even before the hoopla broke out. Afterward, it seemed so obvious.The plane trip... ummmm, they wouldn't allow that, would they??The dental work.... hmmmm, that either...The gal who died tragically & everyone blames James ...gee, this rings a little falseLeonard the mob boss ... yeah right....But still, I really thought there might be a:Lily... oh come ON!!! You killed her off!?! oh please!Sorry, I actually enjoyed reading much of this book, but am left thinking it isn't just part fiction, but more fiction than non
418	Amazing!: This is an amazing show with a great plot line. Came well packaged and on time as promised. Bonus, the guys are extremely hot! I recommend this show to everyone.
419	GREAT book! A must have for all 1st time moms!!!!: I absolutely love this book! Every night I read the next day's info to my husband! He loves knowing what is going on everyday!
420	Wonderful lavendar: I had recently been to a fair and had some lavender water and a delightful lavender parfait. Both were wonderful. I picked up the recipes at the fair and came home to find some lavender to use for these and other interesting culinary recipes. I have always loved the smell of lavender, who knew it tasted so great as well. This culinary lavender was perfect for my recipes.
421	a beautiful book: This story reminds me of the best historical novels, and in some ways of MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, gently weaving fact and fiction. The author's knowledge of life in old China and Taoist philosophy is impressive, and her prose is artful. Her characters are so beautifully drawn! I loved the actual and spiritual journey of the main character, the women he meets along the way, and the delightful depictions of his adventures. A thoroughly enjoyable and poetic book.
422	doesn't help with pressure sores...: bought this for my elder mom who is disabled and this did not help any of her pressure sores or help prevent any of them it, it also didn't help her in her wheelchair.... wish this was better quality its also already starting to fall apart and only had it a few months.
423	Warning: "Assortment" is a stretch: Like the writers of many other reviews I read, I got a disproportionately high amount of plain Special K - around 30 of my 60 bowls. I got no bowls of the Kashi cereal. The net weight of a bowl of plain Special K is 1.5 oz, whereas the other cereals weigh in at around 2.5 oz. Special K is also the cheapest cereal to make of the four, making it extremely suspicious that many shipments of this "assortment" seem to be unbalanced in its favor.I'm pretty upset that I purchased a "4-cereal assortment" that ended up containing only 3, and an undesirable mix of those. Be warned; based on the reviews here, you're likely to have a similar experience.
424	It's not really music: Most of this album is bad, and the rest is really bad. The voice, the songs, and the way she sings them are all medicore and I am amazed that it can be called music. It would be a mistake to buy this CD.
425	Ain't that a lot of love: This item was everything I was expecting and more. Van Cliburn is astounding on every CD I have purchased and this is true to form. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone considering the purchase, Buy it! You will not be sorry.
426	Great book kinda sad and funny at the same time: I really love the book. Steve Perry did a good job with the plot. I think having Dash Rendar gave it some humor. Even though the Emperor is on the cover he has basicly no point. I like that it mentions Boba Fett a lot. I liked the part when Dash Rendar said "Okay Goldie. My name is Man With a Blaster About to Cook You." Xizor was a good character to add. He made the plot more complex.
427	A really cheap but well built keyboard: This is a really surprising find!..a computer keyboard that is not all plastic..actually has weight to it...does not move around when you type..and stays cleaner than my last 70.00 microsoft keyboard. This is a very affordable keyboard that will provide you with many hours of dependability....BUY IT!
428	you get what you pay for!: These frames are super cheap. They are all plastic, the stand in the back is cheap & you pretty much snap it on the back. I needed some cheap frames for gifts, and the price was really reasonable. Next time, I would just spend a little extra to get something nicer.
429	Very poor picture quality; almost unwatchable; Doesn't deserve even one star: I love Robert Benchley shorts as seen on TCM; they are so clean and crisp in picture quality and I expected the same in this expensive Paramount collection. Instead, each short is more faded than the cheapest Alpha video. I've never been more disappointed and would return them for a refund if possible.
430	good introduction: This book by one of the triumvirate of today's leading experimental economists is a solid introduction to many of the challenges which posit to unseat the rational selfish man, homo economicus. Each chapter, which is essentially derived from a corresponding published academic paper by the author on game theory and experimental economics, clearly and succinctly introduces many of the theories and problems currently being researched and debated in academic circles. For someone who is familiar with the author's work, or that of Kahneman and Tversky, the book is largely redundant. Nevertheless the book serves as a great starting point in the field of experimental economics and poses many thought-provoking questions for both the seasoned economist and the curious mind.
431	I can't wait to spend time with Tory again!: I eagerly look forward to the next release in the series!! Wonderful!
432	Too big and horsey looking: I purchased this ring along with the same vendor's 'adorable garnet' ring. Both had to go back. The garnet ring was nice but the large stone was damaged in multiple spots. This ring was in excellent condition but it was just ridiculously big. The photo looks like a ring that could make a statement but not one that would be an anchor! It wasn't heavy, just cheap looking. You half expect to see mold lines up the sides of it. The prongs were also huge and unshapely. It's a shame because it could have been really lovely had the maker simply reduced the size and taken a little more time with the details.I am hesitant to buy from this vendor again.
433	Great show: Love this show. Lost some of the regulars and It's getting a little slow. but I still love the show.
434	garbage - why is there no option for ZERO STARS: Plain and simple, this is not metallica, this is cowboy music.Not only have they released crappy albums, they destroy all their old material when they play them live. I really hope they call it quits or die.
435	Spider-Man RC Monster Truck: This was for my 5 year old son for Christmas. It was what he wanted and he loves it. It works good, but it probably works best outdoors, but we haven't tried it yet. For the superhero fan, I would recommend this product.
436	Very disappointed in this product: I purchased 2 of these based on some of the reviews I read. I am SO disappointed. The plastic jars do not have enough weight to make them stay in the rack properly, and I could see right away that they would always be falling out and that would annoy me. Also one of the racks was not screwed onto the revolving part, so I had to find a screwdriver to put it together. After seeing how the bottles of spices would not stay in their places, I decided to send these back. I would NOT recommend this item to anybody. Sorry.
437	Effective, but NOISY!: Works very well. Removes an amazing amount of moisture in fairly little time. Unfortunately, it was designed, manufactured and tested by profoundly deaf people. It is about as loud as my old Cessna 182 without the other endearing characteristics of that airplane. Buy it ONLY if you are at least one floor away from the unit. Otherwise, get earplugs at the same time!
438	Poor quality and overpriced: We were disappointed with the poor quality of the Logan LG1500 slide file. We returned it. A rivet was missing from the handle and it was of poor construction. It is way over priced.
439	If you've missed George Michael you won't be disappointed: Yes, if you've simply missed just hearing George Michael's unmistakable voice, you will enjoy this CD. It's what you would expect from him and as a fan, that was all I needed to know. Some ballads, some soul searching, some interesting lyrics and something to get you moving. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that he makes a sexy video out of "Flawless" that can be blasted across the screens at my favorite alternative clubs. It's good to hear him again.
440	Silly comedy with a golf background instead of football: I've read everyone of SEP's books, and each one, has gotten sillier. She used to write serious, sexy, well-plotted books. Now she writes so-called romantic comedies. Lady Emma and Kenny, are two very superficial people. Add to that,a lack of plot, a lack of sexual tension, and there's nothing for me to enjoy about this book. I can read about Texas in textbooks, or even in SEP's previous books. It may be Avon's fault, but I've bought my last book by this author.
441	perfect: I live in a shared apartment and I have small room. I had one of those shoe racks before but it was sort of always in the way and there was never enough room for all my footwear. Then I decide to get this product. It is awesome. It fits very nicely on the door. It is very sturdy ( at least so far...i have had this thing for almost a month now) and has enough room for all my shoes. You can fit a pair easily in a pocket except for some heels. After putting in all my shoes I still had a pocket or two left which I used for all the small items that I need but never find a good place to keep them.
442	This is a magazine, not a paperback: Although there were some interesting recipes, I was extremelydisapointed when I opened the box to find a magazine. It is describedas a paperback, but it is printed on magazine-quality paper. Additionally, most of the recipes have appeared in MSL over the past two years. END
443	Great value: Great product with an even better price. I priced these cleats much higher at a local sporting goods retailer. My 15 year old son is really enjoying them.
444	Fantastic book: This book was brand new for a great price. I recieved it in only a few days. It is an excellent book. Thank You!
445	has some bugs: I bought this watch at target because it looked great. I have had it for a couple of months and normally wear it outside in short sleeves so it gets plenty of sun. However, it randomly resets itself to 1-1-2000 12 midnight about every 2 weeks! I find it very annoying to have to reset the watch so frequently. It also goes into power save mode at random times and displays an incorrect time (power save mode freezes the clock hands and shuts off the digital display when it thinks you won't be using the watch). I think this is all probably a defect in the solar technology and not just a defect in my watch. I wouldn't recommend this watch
446	At least they are boys: I got a headache after listening to 5 seconds of their first song. How many more boy bands are their going to be? At least they are boys. But if it's the 15 year old girls that are listening to the 25 year old men of BSB and N'SYNC how old are the girls listening to Dream Street?
447	karaoke machine: Very disappointed in machine. Wanted the American Idol machine with 2 mic's and ordered this because it showed the cordless and 2nd microphone. Over priced for the item.
448	Super Guitarist: Joe Satriani in his new "Super Colossal", proves again that he is one of the most influential rock guitarists of our age.He continues to define his sound developing further and further his distinct musical tunes.This is again a great CD from a great guitarist player; highly recommended.
449	slamwich is fun: This is a fun card game, much like slapjack but with cute pictures and a few different rules. My girls enjoy playing it. It can go on for a long time, though so just be prepared if you're thinking it is a short card game, it is not. Get comfortable!
450	Kikkoman Plum Sauce: We bought this Kikkoman Plum Sauce from our Grocery Store. It was for a hung roasted whole duck from the local Asian Market. This duck was as good as Duck I've had in Hong Kong. We made our own pancakes/crepes Hong Kong style. We cut Fresh green spring onions.We tasted this sauce before ruining our duck. The sauce was absolutely the worst. Bad flavor, bad smell. Not real Plum Sauce, it's mostly bad Soy Sauce. We returned it. Bad stuff.
451	Amazed by the reader reviews: I thought this was a very well-written and interesting description of the relationship between two brothers. I agree that pages 75-125 were slow but the rest of the book is by no means dull. Canin gradually reveals what caused the estrangement of the two brothers and his description of life in the small Wisconsin town where he grew up is often vivid with truly three-dimensional characters. I don't know whether anyone will believe me after reading the prior reviews but I highly recommend this novel.
452	Worth buying a DVD player for: IF you don;t have a DVD player, i would get one just to see this DVD. This is the greatest movie I've ever seen for all ages. Whether you are 7 or 700 you should see this DVD!
453	Becuase Of Winn Dixie: Because Of Winn DixieOne day I was walking to the store to pick up some food. There was a bit of craziness going on. The manager of the store was on the ground and there was a dog licking his face. The manager said gets this dog off of me and call the pound. "I screamed no you can't call the pound that's my dog". The manager said well then get that dog out of here I said come here boy. The manager said what's? His name I said "Winn Dixie". I took the dog home. To find out more read this book Because Of Winn Dixie by Katie Decamillo.
454	Better options available: I will be returning this product. The Day and Night monitor by Summer Infant works much better. Although the Safety 1st monitor has 900 Mhz technology, we experienced interference from our 2.4 Mhz phone. The interference caused the screen to blink, fuzz up and roll. We had the screen in the kitchen and were also unable to watch the baby on the screen when we ran the microwave and/or washing machine due to interference. Worst of all, the baby's papasan swing at the detector camera also caused similar interference. The camera does not move up and down for viewing the baby as does the one by Summer Infant. If you are concerned about SIDS, you can't see slight breathing motions on the screen anyway. If that is why you are buying this item, don't. We bought the Angelcare motion detector/sensor for that, and it works great!
455	Its a pretty good movie.: I liked the movie, had a good storyline and plot to it. Jews during World War 2 struggling to survive the Nazi order. Shows a lot of emotion about how some of these people went through. Tough times. Rent it, watch it, and if you like it like I did. Buy it for your collection.
456	The legends and myths that contribute to Rowling's settings: Where did Rowling receive inspiration for her Harry Potter books? The Magical Worlds Of Harry Potter surveys the legends and myths that contribute to Rowling's settings, from reallife wizards to alchemists and unicorns. Interviews with Rowling blend with reviews of these myths and legends in this fine survey of young Potter's early influences.
457	Great Idea, Failed Twice: Love the idea. After a few months the first one only would produce a stream. Bought a second one because I loved how it worked (when it worked) so much. Same problem :(
458	Awful and embarrassing.: I don't know what's up with Patterson. There is no excuse for some of the glaring errors in this book.The ending makes no sense.This is not up to the standards of "Kiss the Girls" and "Along Came a Spider".
459	Yep, Clogged Printer Head: Same deal as many other reviews. I just found out that my printer head is clogged and it will cost $125 to have it serviced. Thanks Canon. I find this very frustrating since I really like their camera equipment. I guess they don't put in the same time and effort for a quality printer.oh well. Don't buy it.
460	Night off: Angela Gheorgiu sounds uncomfortable in this live performance. Te evening gets off to a bad start with Handel and Mozart, and even in the idiom which is usually her srength (e.g. Puccini), she sounds careworn and struggling with pitch.
461	My son (3 and 1/2) loves these stories, however...: Great stories with great characters, but if you've already purchased "Funniest Stories Ever..." then don't bother with "Bedtime Stories" because "Bedtime..." merely contains a subset of the stories found in "Funniest", with no new material what-so-ever.This was needless to say rather disappointing to find out, following the online purchase.
462	Dissapointing.: This toy would be great if you could see what was going on on the screen. Only little points of light light up on the screen and make it difficult to really engage a child for very long. It just doesn't seem to interest my toddler at all. I'm sorry that I spent the money on it.
463	excellent gun: I have had this gun since christmas and it hasn't gotten damaged at all. It shoots far but if the darts get bent they go like 8 feet. It doesn't jam too much, and if it does it is easy to fix overall it is really good. <(o_o)>
464	Fresh New Christian Folk Music: I'm excited by this recent release. Andrew's music has the best of all of the elements that characterize the acoustic "new folk" style - insightful lyrics, wonderful stories, fresh acoustic production - sparse but nicely arranged, some of the finest vocal harmonies I've ever heard and an overall unique sound. Its hard to do an album like this without that element of sameness that settles in after a few songs. Surprisingly, the mix of music is quite varied and each song has a strength that makes for repeated listening.
465	good frother but breaks easily: this is a great frother, fast and makes perfect foam but it has what seems to be a major design flaw, we have now had (and broken) 2 and both suffered from the same issues. As soon as some water accidentally gets into the inside (from the small holes underneath) while cleaning then you need to get your credit card out and buy a new one. as much as I love this machine and its ease of uses - I am buying something different this time.
466	False advertizing: If you will notice on the Amazon website:"Language: English, Japanese"Oops, DVD actually has no Japanese!!Thought it was too good to be true and it was. Zero stars as far as I'm concerned for false advertising. Probably the fault of Amazon's database. Guess the general warning is be careful with Amazon and anything they list as to languages.
467	poor quality construction: We didn't own this watch a month before the watch strap broke off the watch body. Just like about 6 other Casio watches we've owned. No way to repair since it was part of the watch body that snapped off. Will never buy another Casio.
468	Worst movie I've ever seen: I rented this movie back in the 90s. I could not believe how awful it was. Seemed like one long neverending scene.
469	hummingbird feeder: Absolutly the best feeder I have ever purchased. There are hummingbirds on it at all times. I added a water trap to the top and it keeps out the ants.
470	Boring with a wimpy heroine: Don't know why I wasted my money. I'm not a fan of damsel in distress novels. The writing was so bad! My first and last Kay Hooper book.
471	Does not work.: I screws shut ok and clicks, but mine will open again no matter what position the lock is in or whether the key is in or out. So it's a locking cap that doesn't lock.I would usually assume I just got a defective one and would try again, but this cap feels so very flimsy that I am just returning it and looking for wnother solution.
472	cute but run really small: These shoes are very cute, the shoe laces are a bit short and they run very small.
473	Awful! Please dont waste your money: Bought these on sale at Babies RUS. Well, now I know why they are so frequently on sale. The cloth is too thin and flimsy to use as diapers or burp cloths, and even worse, the material sheds little fibers constantly into the air. I had to wash an entire load of laundry again because all the fibers from these diapers got onto them,. They shed even after they are washed and dried.Terrible quality!
474	Not so great shipping...: The company shipped the cheese to my parents' house in Florida, but it was badly packaged with a disposable ice-pack (not dry ice) in the bottom, nowhere near the cheese, and left in the sun all day until it was, for the most part, melted.
475	Alright for the information...: but it's just that. So if you're in the market for anything else, look.. well elsewhere. This book just gives a sometimes one-sided view on current politics surrounding captalism, poverty, etc. Interesting only for research purposes.
476	So worth the money!: I have had a Junior Mason Pearson for 20 yrs. It was a gift from a flight attendant friend of my mothers. As a kid I thought a hairbrush??? As an adult 20 yrs later, I'm looking for another! I have looked at other brushes, even bought them, but until you use a Mason Pearson you just won't understand! It's just THAT good!
477	Is this even the same author?: I had read Carey's other books (the Kushiel trilogy, and Banewreaker) and was completely delighted with them. Figuring that a good author generally doen't put out a bad book, I picked this one up. Well, now I have learned better.This book is painfully dissapointing. Sunny is written like a caricature of that friendly girl in high school who solved everybody's problems by putting her ankles behind her ears. Bridget is written like a ghost long before she's actually dead. Jean is almost a saving grace, but it's too little too late.Don't waste your time. This author is a wonderful writer, just not in this book. I feel like I just bought a Maria Callas recording, only to hear her yodeling on the disc.
478	Only one word. Great.: In a nutshell, this is the greatest actor in American history, possibly in the history of the English language in one of his greatest preformances. The movie would be a gem based on the script and supporting performances alone, but Brando elevates it to being one of the greatest films in the history of the medium.
479	No NDIS2 protocol available: Ok unit but is not a "real" Xircom; no support for DOS or ghost drivers. Good choice for the basics but not a business class unit. I'm returning it and buying a Realport Unit.
480	Undoubtedly a GREAT book, but a TERRIBLE Kindle edition: DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE EDITION OF FAITH'S CHECKBOOK!!! It is so full of typos. This edition sadly misrepresents the author and someone should do something to get this Kindle edition off the market. For example, in today's reading in the book (March 16) there are three typos/wrong words in the opening paragraph. THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!
481	Save Your Money: Quite possibly the most over-hyped album of 2002. Lo-Fi productions are often more endearing for their more "true/real" artistic expression. Yet, there is nothing really inspiring musically or lyrically (unless you enjoy the very tired genre of guys talking about their members and multiple relationships/orgasms) to be found on this 'masterpiece'. From 2 CD's worth of tracks, only a handful have memorable hooks. Simply put, this album stinks -- Cody, please stay at home.
482	A must for true JT fans!: If you are a James Taylor fan you must have this DVD. I saw this concert when it was originally broadcast on PBS and the DVD is so much better, especially if you have surround sound. The bonus JT videos reminded me of why they are never seen om MTV or VH1!
483	good game: This game is good.In some parts its foggy and difficult.The monsters always revive again,you collect soul points for each kill.The camera is a bit crazy sometimes.Theres no story-line.This all seems very bad for the game but I find it enjoyble.The game is challenging and has 19(kinda short).But I tell you you'll keep on playing until you complete the game.And in each soul puzzle piece of your friends you collect,a new weapon appears.Its very cool.So,if you like killing,mix hack slash with third person shooting and challenging games this is one you'll like.
484	The plastic nozzle broke.: I bought this thinking it would provide me a few good years of service, but it lasted a bit over a month.The compressor worked well and pretty quickly. A bit of a pain as to the location of the on/off switch in the cord storage area, but the auto shut-off feature was very nice.Then I took it out today to inflate my snowblower tires and the nozzle literally broke apart. Seems that the business end of this compressor should be less fragile. Very disappointed.
485	Tom Clancy at his Best!: There is an illegal drug being sold on the Net that makes you Superman. The FDA calls on Net Force and the NSA to stop the seller.I liked the action and the descriptions Clancy uses to describe what's going on. Every thing is described with great detail.I would recommend this book to adults that like violence, action and details about guns.
486	An Exciting Fictional Story: When Meg and Charles Wallace are visited by an old lady, she tells them about a tesseract. She invites them to her house and when they go they meet her two friends. They do a thing called tessering and travel to a different planet. The kids find out that they have to save their father and the Earth. They go to a planet called Camozotz and have to fight the power of IT, a brain that controls life on Camozotz. I did like this book because of all the things that are going on, but be careful because some parts are hard to understand. Read the book to find out what happens. Hope you like it!!!
487	NOT for people stuck in the 80's: I'm reading the reviews on here, do you people still have 80's haircuts too?If, according to you, "his older stuff was so much better," then perhaps Prince should play the Las Vegas circuit, singing Purple Rain day in, day out to mindless middle aged Prince fans who were in high school during his heyday.Perhaps he should be a carbon copy Little Richard. Or perhaps he should "sell out" and chase hip hop trends the way Michael Jackson has.No thanks. I like my Prince creative, evolving, and mature. If you are expecting one Purple Rain after another, then perhaps your tastes have matured much since 1984. That said, no, his latest stuff hasn't always been 100% stellar each and everytime. He is not God, people.Good for you, Prince. You deserve that RnR Hall of Fame induction!!
488	Don't Make your Decision based on the sticks being included.: The test sticks are not included with this product. If you email customer support they will not send you the test sticks seperately, they will just send you several generic emails basically saying... if you don't like it send it back. So if you can find another deal (which I did see better) out on the web for a monitor alone for less you should consider it. The monitor has had great results for friends and family. I look forward to seeing the results. Unfortunately I went out and purchased sticks and began using it before I found out Amazon would not send me the test sticks that were missing.
489	Great DVD!: I love the way this DVD is put together. It has both a quick 12 minute fat-blast and a 40 minute total body workout. Even the 12 minute workout leaves you sweating and out of breath. I believe this workout would be great for beginners as well as the more advanced. I also love the hour glass time countdown on the screen that helps you see exactly how much time you have left on each exercise and the countdown for the rests shown on the screen too. I remember thinking 2 mins of work and a min of rest didn't sound that bad. Wow! It's an awesome workout!! Just seeing Lauren is motivating as well. Thank you Lauren!!
490	Im buying Havaianas from now on!: I've only had these for a day and I love them already. I haven't really got to wear them alot so I dont know about the durability or if the dont get dirty. But I can vouch for how comfortable they are. You will not regret buying these.
491	Third set have failed.: These headphones work fine initially, but fail far too easily.I first a set 3 years ago, and liked the way they fit in my ears.Soon though, one side of the stereo started to fail. I jiggled them for months to get them to work until they stopped functioning altogether.I bought another pair and they failed after a some months of light use.Dumb me, I bought this last pair and THEY have now failed.I know, I know, fool me once... Except I didn't learn and went to thrice.The noise reduction works but produces a hiss that you really only notice between songs.My advice: There are so many better options. These seem designed to fail.
492	Great taste - at least my children say so!: My children ASK for their vitamin every day! I've heard from several sources that Solaray is a good brand, so we gave this a shot as our first vitamin and weren't disappointed. We have gotten this at Whole Foods in the past but the price seems to be cheaper on Amazon (at least at the time I purchased it).
493	Ineffective and Painful: Does not work. Very little results. Also, excessive pain caused me to use them once a day after 4 days of using them twice a day. Let's see if they keep their word about a money back guarantee when I contact them.
494	Like Heaven: I absolutely love these sheets. They are soft and comfy. The color is a beautiful light soft blue. The perfect color I was looking for. I love laying in bed for extra time in these sheets.
495	INCREBIBLE!!!!!!!: These books are the most incredible, wonderful, imgainative, moving, amazing books I have read and will read in my entire life! J.R.R Tolkien is the best author and I Have been through the trilogy two times, the Hobbit and the Fellowship of the Ring again since then, all in one year! They are wonderful incredible, and if you read these and say you don't like them, well, youre nutz!
496	An Arm Wrestling Contest to Use with Devices/Computers/Printers: I bought this on a whim, since I already had a Netgear 624 that was fine. The 614 would sometimes fail to connect devices/computers/printers, sometimes would show a 'low signal' at the device side, and would seldom recognize my HP wireless printer, so I moved everything back to my Netgear 624 which worked calmly and well. I think the 614 is higher powered in terms of signal, but its software or electronics or both are faulty. I developed a scheme: each day, power down the unit and power it back up, to keep signal strong, etc. My advice is: don't buy the 614, even if they give it away eventually. I don't know which wireless router to suggest since I'm only used the 624 and the 614. BEfore this I was wired with a Linksys that performed fine and stable for years and years. I don't know today who makes a solid wireless router. I suspect only one or two of them out there are truly solid and reliable.
497	Don't use this on your baby!: Don't use this on your baby. We used it on a newborn and 6 hours of crying ensued. After a trip to the ER and the baby checked out fine it was determined that it had to be the diaper cream. It smells strongly of menthol. Lesson learned to stay with the tried and true Desitin or Boudreauxs. Very sad for a newborn and first time mother to have to endure. Burts should stay with what they know. The best part is that it was a gift and no cost (except the ER bill) and it's now in the trash compactor.
498	Lush and informative, a bit pretentious: This set of 2 books is an exceptionally splendid and easy to read catalogue of european foods. However, a France/Belgium are grossly overrepresented (yes, I am not enthusiastic about the popular belief of Gallic culinary superiority), while smaller nations got the boot...some pan-european foods seem to have simply been tucked into the first convenient section...the section on Russia is somewhat lacking and the dishes are misspelled. Still, a very lovely and useful set.
499	covers and accuracy: I can't find covers, but will try the cvs brand. I noticed some inconsistancey with measurements, but I did not read the instructions that advises 2 minutes in between mesurements. One should make sure that they read the instructions carefully and not throw away the manual. It looks self explanatory, but it isn't.
500	Bloody hell, Morse!: An insult to Ian Hunter fans everywhere. "Invisible Strings" is the only song here which bears repeated listening. And Ian's version of "Red Letter Day" is vastly inferior to Scott Folsom's. The non-Hunter songs are a joke. Shame on you Ian! Mott the Cat.
501	Very satisfied: This is my second set of logitech wireless keyboard/mouse combo I've had (the first one handed down to my dad) and I'm very satisfied. I find the logitech input devices very comfortable and natural.Specifically about this set, I like how the wireless base also acts as a charger for the mouse. The keyboard multimedia buttons aren't quite as customizable as I want, but it's still pretty good.
502	Good Reading for Media Managers: Even a book that is somewhat dated can still be beneficial to leaders in their field. That's true for managers of media organizations and this book. In fact, the first few pages talk about how rapidly changes in information companies are occurring. Some of the philosophical and practical issues described in this book are still pertinent. Another enduring feature of the book is some of the history it contains. A further value to the book is that some of the theories of management demonstrate the evolution of thinking in that dimension of a manager's job. The best of each of the theories is still relevant. The irrelevant can be eliminated quite easily enough.There are organizational charts and graphs in this book that help illustrate the text. Terms are defined which are still valid in today's business operations. The research throughout this book is well documented. I recommend this book because it is still very useful in the media world of today.
503	Good for a cheap costume: I was glad that I ordered the "Full Figured" Adult size. I'm a 12/14 but with a larger chest, so this worked well. I don't think this would fit a size 22.
504	Every Preschool Teacher needs this!: This recoding is what we and many others use for Opening, Circle Time, Language Arts, as well as general fun with the kids!Cannot endorse it enough!
505	Good Movie: This is such a great movie. It is very well done. The characters, plot, story are all better. One thing for sure is that SM2 does not have a lame villain like the first movie. My only complaints are that as cool as he is, Doc Ock didn't get that much screen time. And the ending could have been more exciting/
506	Not worth the time: This book has the sorriest story line ever! Sorry to spoil the story for people who haven't read this book. So, basically, the Hero uses and abuses the Heroine. They get married, Then a frenchman came along and "killed" her husband then she slept with that guy!( Her husband is not dead). She found out the husband is not dead, try to break up with the frenchman, he didn't want to , so they killed him. She then goes off to travel around the world with the husband. She got lost and was travelling by herself. While she was travelling, she was basically whoring herself! Sleeping with hot guys, but would not have sex with a White fat man, African man, and Chinese man. Then at the end comes back to the man who abuses her and realize she then "Loves " him. Waste of time!
507	Ehh...: Needed a heartrate monitor for P90X. This does not really work well. Strapping the sensor around your chest, which is not always accurate, and jumps around. I am sure if I follow their directions to a T it may work better, but I think I have and it still doesnt. (Moisten the conductivity pads on the chest strap). It is just annoying, and to be honest, I am learning that you get what you pay for. Get something nicer that reads the BPM right off your wrist instead of having an annoying strap around your chest.
508	Ceremonial Richness: Anyone wanting ceremonial richness in their own lives will cherish this book and will feel emboldened to start where they are right now-even in the middle of a city, far from the kind of natural surroundings available to the ancients. "It is the spirit of the ceremony that is most important," reassures a grandmother. This is treasure to own and consult, a treasure to give.-SA
509	1 star only because I couldn't select 0: This movie SUCKED. Not one good thing to say about it. Foul language, zero to no funny parts. Sad, depressing. STUPID!!!!! Don't waste your time or money. Spend time cleaning your toilet instead. You'll be better off and it will be more enjoyable I promise.
510	Honest, frank, no nonsense guide to a successful website.: This book gives an honest account of what makes a successful website. It gives real-world examples, describes them well, and gives you great advice/source code on how to do it for yourself!The section on RDBMS is particular of use to web designers/site admins who have/need to set up and maintain databases, especially for sites that are collaborative online communities.Interspersed between the usually humorous text are beautiful photos, which kinda gives your eyes a rest from reading.
511	crap: let's face it this is not punk it's pop like all of the other crap over mtv there are sum decent songs but emo/punk bands like my chemical romance and the used are way better
512	Great read!: This is the first book by this author that I have read and was thrilled. I couldn't put it down! I truly wanted to know what happened next. Very impressed.
513	pony heaven for mlp lovers: These playsets are great. I am so glad hasbro brought back mlp. My daughter has collected them for about four years now. We have the 80's playsets and the new ones. I found all of them to be great. But these are not toys for toddlers or very young children.They are plastic and do of course break. They are also not mindless push a button video games. They require IMAGINATION!They are not babysitters to prop your child in front of.My daughter is eight and her and the ponies enter a world of imagination that lasts for days! Yes you set them up and leave them. If you want less space taken up buy a polly pocket. The playsets have just enough activity to start an idea for play and leave the rest for the childs imagination. I love to watch my daughter play with the playsets and I join in on the fun too! Keep up the good work hasbro. Don't let the mlp line go away again,please. We love them!
514	Save Your $$$: I have had this little device for almost a year and had not been disappointed. I use it with my iPhone, yes it gives you that awful hissing sound whenever is searching for a signal but I have purchased speakers of more than $150 and they suffered the same problem. For your money save you $$$ and use this little wonder.
515	HP 74XL, Great product, great value: This extra large, high capacity ink tank is the genuine HP product, at a good price. It lowers your cost per print.
516	phillips norelco replacement head HQ6: The manual specified HQ6. However, the head did not mesh with the motor. Either the manual specified the wrong head or the merchandise was mislabeled.
517	Tell us something we don't already know: It's clear that Joe Klein fancies himself as the consummate political insider, but "The Running Mate" fails to deliver anything that might back up his claim to that throne.This book is page after excruciatingly slow page of political stereotypes and charicatures, without a solid plot line to hold it together.
518	Frayed edges, not strong enough: I really like the look and feel of these spatulasThe handle are quite durable and feel great in the handhowever the nylon surface just is not what I had hoped forthe edge has frayed with use (looks like it has melted and I don't cook on extreme heat)
519	A waste of time!!!: This book contains almost NO world information (and without world information, a book is purely worthless!), a few pages on mercs (which i could of pulled out of my arse myself and done a better job), painfully long descriptions of a buncha' mercenary groups (worthless, unless you enjoy reading character bios), and WAY too many weapons (we have enough guns already!) that are pretty darned overpowered, if i do say so myself! A munchkin's wet dream, and a GM's nightmare. DON'T BUY IT!
520	Can you survive in the wilderness for a whole year?: My Side of the Mountain by Jean George follows the story of young Sam. Sam, an unhappy pre-teen is tired of his busy city life. He has no privacy and can't seem to get away from the yelling and crying of his brothers and sisters! Later he tells his family he is going to run away to their grandfather's old piece of land in the forest. There he learns survival techniques and how to cope with the strange seasons. Sam also meets people and animals that seem like family. The winter will be coming soon! Will Sam be ready or will he freeze in the snow?The pros of this story are that you could picture every word and you could understand it, too! It had amazing characters and an interesting plot. The cons of this story are that at some parts it can get slow and boring. The ending also could have been changed so when you finished the book you wouldn't be so discouraged. Overall this book was fantastic!
521	I had to get my hands on this book to find out what this guy was up to.: The class paranoid title alone moves units and is an indicator of what exactly this guy is selling. I've tried paying attention to him when he and his wife appeared on public television but I just don't get it. I didn't finish the book because his real estate advice leaves out too many variables. I get the feeling that he impresses people who have no business experience and those people have reason to fear their own ignorance so he's got them on the hook. I'm writing this review because I read that he has contacted Casey Serin - the wet behind the ears disaster flipper - to get acquainted AND he is partnering up with Donald Trump. I think this guy is selling the emperor's clothes I really do. Lesson One: He's not mentoring future moguls for the price of this paperback. This book is a waste of money.
522	Burner Lover!!: My family gave me the Cape May set for a wedding present. It is now discontinued so my mother told me to seek out the odd pieces on eBay. Well, Mom was right. I bought 4. These are so easy to clean. Just soak them in bleach spray and the grease comes right off. They look brilliant sitting on my stove.
523	Where did this price come from?: I don't understand the high price on these when they are $21.95 to $25.99 for the designer cotton ones all over the Web. I ussually order from Amazon so that I can one click, but not at double the price.
524	Backroads is a complete waste of your $$$: Do not order this. It is a child's level scribbled guide that is useless. I threw it in the trash after 15 minutes.
525	More bang for the buck: While you can get a slight improvement by buying a ti 4600, This has a much greater price to effectivity ratio. This product is perfect for 3d gaming. I can play any of the latest games on the highest settings, and the 64Mb's RAM is actually faster than the 128Mb version because the RAM is a faster kind.
526	not worth the money: this product doesn't work as well as some others I have found at Target for a lot less money.
527	If You've Got The Q or Baby Q, You've Gotta Get The Tools: OK, I like to complete the set of whatever I buy. I purchased the Baby Q and had to have the cart b/c the Baby Q set perfectly atop the cart. I purchased the cart and had to have the tools b/c the tools fit perfectly in the little notches on the cart. The marketing team at Weber must know how this red blooded male thinks because I've always gotta buy the other stuff that goes along with whatever I buy.
528	the worst movie I have ever seen: I am a HUGE Resident Evil fan but these movies are getting worse and worse. I cant believe someone produced this piece of garbage. Half way through I was so bored. The story is lame and hardly plausible even by zombie standards. No cool weapons or fights, no sex, no fear. Even if I was 13 I would think this movie sucked. It deserves zero stars for this abortion of a movie.
529	beginner blues guitar: Very early in this instruction book the author expects a beginner to do a six fret stretch. Not many people can accomplish that and I feel as though it leads to frustration too early in the game.
530	NOT FOR TV USE - POOR PRODUCT: TV USE - do not buy this product if you plan on using it with your tv - the product comes with wiring for a walkman or stereo - the wiring supplied will not work with our tv - we had to go to radio shack to buy the proper wiring.the earphones produce a hissing sound as well. very poor product - worth 10 to 15 bucks.
531	Gread Foundation for CDMA: This book provides an excellent foundation for CDMA technology.The text is divided into 3 sections. The 1st deals with basic communication theory and is a good reference, or foundation of communications and CDMA. The 2nd part is the IS95 standard, and the 3rd is CDMA2k. It must be a relatively new book, because there are lots of errors, but they're mainly all typo's. In general, the author was very concise, and allowed me to come up to speed from virtually no background and now understand things like fading, multipath, along with the higher level view of CDMA and how it differs from frequency modulation, phase modulation etc... The spec's are all pin plain english as well - so all in all the book is easy to read.
532	Avoid this Over hyped book: Nothing here worth reading about unless u like self absorption.Pooly written and uninfomative.
533	Excellent: My three year old son really likes this CD. He is bilingual,and he gets to choose what language to listen to. He likes the clickable stickers and has really learned how to master the mouse. He also has fun building the sand castles. I really like all the features on this CD. I wish I could find more multilingual CD's like this one.
534	Extremely Frustrating: I bought this book here several years ago when I was freshly back from a wonderful trip to Italy. For whatever reason, I never felt like reading it until last week. After reading the first piece, by Morante, I am not eager to read any further.I knew this book consisted of excerpts from other pieces, but I assumed they would be chosen and edited carefully so they could stand on there own. Sadly, this was not the case at all. After reading the 100+ page excerpt from House of Liars, the piece just stopped dead in it's tracks with no resolution for any of the characters. In fact, it stopped right in the midst of a turning point for all four of the main characters. I was shocked that it ended there.I feel like I paid $13.00 for a "sneak preview" designed to get me to buy the books that are excerpted. Thanks, but no thanks.
535	Lousy shipping: The box was left on my back porch in the rain with no bag over it. The entire thing fell apart when I tried to move it. This was after I happened to look out and see it, as no notice was left at the front door alerting me to its presence. There comes a point at which free shipping is not worth it.And, did you know that the plastic they use to individually wrap the rolls isn't waterproof? I DO.I'm cancelling my regular order immediately. What a kick in the teeth.
536	Good book: A good book for helping kids deal with problems if other kids tease them about having gay parents.Sincerely,John Ryan Davis, age 11.
537	Joss Whedon does it again!: I originally saw a couple of episodes of Firefly on TV when it first aired (out of sequence) and couldn't really get into it.Now that I have seen it all on DVD in the proper order, I LOVE IT and can't believe I almost let this one slip by. What a wonderful cast of characters and terrific writing. This is a must for Joss Whedon fans or anyone who likes Sci Fi.
538	good biography: I've liked Margaret Cho for a while now so it was interesting to read about her life and how she got to where she is now. It deals with her childhood where she was an outcase and had a father who in and out. It deals with the difficulties of her getting recognition made coumpounded by ancestory and the blow she took from her show all-american girl, a show that seemed to have gotten criticism from many sources, the network, critics, the asian american community....Finally she book deals with how margaret cho has come to terms with who she is as a person.
539	Nice Product: Its really nice for carrying your laptop and its power cable around as long as you're not planning to include lot of other stuff along with it. I carry a mouse and a pair of head phones in the bag and its a tight fit.Got a lot of padding though to protect your laptop so you don't have to worry about being a little rough with it. Overall its a great quality product, and for around $17 including shipping I'd say its a really good bargain.
540	dark, freakish movie: Sort of post apocalyptic, dark movie where people are the worst creatures ever. I don't think it was made for kids. I do not recommend.
541	I Ninja = bad: I Ninja isn't fun at all. If I could give it 0 stars, I would, but that is not an option.Don't get this game. The graphics are lame, the music is annoying, I ninja is creepy-looking and his moves suck.
542	A toy designed for a 3 yr old should withstand the play of a 3 yr old: Flimsy. Correctly assembled but of such poor quality, i boxed it up and sent it back before my niece knew about. I don't care how smart the kid is, if the toy is meant for a young child, it should not have springs and cogs that could easily be exposed and swallowed. You shouldn't be afraid to let a child play with a toy Hasbro has been making toys for decades and should know better. I've yet to have a flimsy little tykes product. I've even purchased a fisher-price aquarium swing (not the toy) that was promptly replaced when the motor died, at NO COST to me. I didn't even have to return the defective one.Point being, don't waste your money and don't disappoint your child.
543	can't read it: the display is transparent with black lcd lettering & can only be seen from certain angles against a white background. I have a black desk, and the certain angles don't include angles I can see it from when sitting at my desk. I can just barely read it when sitting comfortably if I put it on a white piece of paper.
544	This should be on the best seller list.: Being a first grade teacher and avid children's literature fan, I came across this book in our school library. The cover was absolutely gorgeous and it invited me to open it up. The author allows you to view how each family member remembers the highs and lows of Christmas, including the family pets. When I read the book to my class, the conversations and discussion tumbled into building Christmas memories and traditions of their own. This story catapulted us into one of the most memorable teaching experiences of my life. I highly reccommend it to anyone who works with children. When I shared this book with other faculty members, each had the same response,"Where can I get it?" I am unsure why this book is not being printed. Perhaps the publisher needs to receive a few phone calls! This book is a million emotion investment!!
545	Oh, Please...: I do enjoy reading various view points, but this tired rhetoric didn't get any better in long form than it was in sound bites.
546	useless: this cable is no capable of doing what it's suppose to do, so don't waste your money on it. You will not be able to watch HD movies nor HD tv using this cable is not good enough to connect anything to a HDTV, it sucks.
547	Beware, Two Versions: I bought 4 sets of these glasses at Macy's today and in the process of opening the boxes to check for any damaged pieces I discovered that there are two versions. The boxes are the same, and the designs are the same but one version is heavier, has a thicker rim, and the glass is less clear when held up to the light. They appear more casual than the other version. The version I chose was more formal in the respect that it had a thinner rim, and when held up to the light, was clearer, swirl free glass. Both versions were great looking but I wonder if this accounts for the different reviews. The heavier ones are probably less fragile. I would also recommend checking the rims of the "finer" version. I found a few tall glasses with sharp edges that I traded for perfect ones with the help of the sales lady. They were on sale for 34.99 with another 15 percent off if you use your Macy's card. I think they're gorgeous!
548	Not worth the Ink: Sadly a good Idea, stolen from the Next Gen series, which was originally stolen from Dr. Who, is subjected to a unsucessful attempt to join two groups that have nothing to do with each other. While the characterizations weren't at all bad, the interactions were. Storm and Picard was forced, and Picard and Archangel was just not a good idea in the first place. But, a disapointing book was made just plain silly with Crusher's offer at the end, and it's reception by the group.Don't bother.
549	Re-calibrating our view of the Christian life: Hybels isn't a wordsmith, but he's probably the best I've heard/read at hitting you between the eyes with a simple, powerful message. This book chronicles the lives of several individuals who turned their frantic, rat-race lives upside down by "descending" into humility and self-sacrifice. Hybels parallels the life and attitudes of Christ, describing how the God of the universe humbled himself to become our Savior in order to reach a greater joy. Easy, motivational, powerful reading
550	And it sits, half read, on my shelf..: I am normally a fan of Anne Rice, and was excited when this book came out, but as soon as I sat down and started reading it, I was greatly disappointed. I tried to force myself to get through it, telling myself that "something interesting has to happen soon"; it never did. Finally, I had to set it aside, and now it sits on my shelf, waiting until I have someone to give it to as a gift, someone with more patience for weak characters and dragging, pointless description, than myself.
551	Only good for a few uses: Waste of money. Hoped it would be good quality given the high price tag compared to standard garden hoses. I bought one of these at a local hardware store about a year ago. It's about the same amount of trouble to setup as a normal hose. You must uncoil and remove completely from reel to use. Worked well enough the first few uses. But when I brought it out to use the next summer it leaked so badly that no water even made it to the end of the hose. I always handled the hose carefully, it just doesn't hold up.
552	An eye-opener!: I only caught part of this show when it was originally on HBO. It was much more interesting that I had thought it would be. I've been trying some of the tips for getting more sleep and some of them seem to have worked! I'm looking forward to watching the entire program on DVD. Thanks for another good feature, HBO!
553	Cleans very well!: We finally got away from fabric couches to these nice white leather set from Ikea. I have been looking around for the best leather cleaner out there and a number of sites and leather outfits recommended the Lexol brand. I found this one for lighter color leather applications and it has work extremely well. We clean these couches once a month and it leaves the cleaning cloth completely soiled. We are quite surprised with how much grudge this product can pick up.
554	Not sure about this: It may be a cutesy Darwin fish with sticky stuff on back but will it evolve? I'll wait to see if it lasts a few million years before I buy one.
555	Love This: Great for Moms with little time. The arm workout is my favorite; great challenge. I also love the stretch workout at the end of the day. The DVD is quick to load, and you can easily bypass all of the intro screens. Each of the 5 workouts is almost exactly 10 minutes long.
556	An excellent read: I believe this is one of the most interesting books I have read in a while. It was impossible to put down and I was able to finish it in 2 days, even though it was 600 odd pages long. However, there is no sequel to the book, and it needs one. I have been reading through some other reviews, and someone wrote that they had heard from the publishers that another book is coming out. Two questions though, when?, and why not now? Really, I'm not a patient man, I've been waiting for over a year for a sequel. Though, with the writing in this book, it should be worth it. To all future readers, be warned, he will HAVE to read a sequel.
557	Disappointed, boot-legged copy, not complete: This stated the BURLESQUE DVD was NEW. It was a boot-legged copy and skipped entire CHAPTERS. I could NOT even see the end of the movie.Very disappointing, now I will have to go to BEST BUY and purchase a REAL new copy.
558	From Concentrate- Dishwater: They source from many locations, partly owned by PepsiCo, from concentrate. The result is a bland drink that tastes like a bit like grass and dirt.
559	better than expected: Tasted better than I expected. Pretty low calorie too. I eat these at work when I'm too busy to walk down to the microwave. Heats well - just pour water on the pad in the box. Comes with soup which I've never eaten but the cookies are good.
560	Elaborate and Realistic: crown of Chekov: Inspired by a real-life incident of the death of a sea gull, this is hailed as the best written play by Chekov, The Sea Gull tells a poignant love story centered on literaray nonentity Konstantin's tragic quest for a burgeoning actress Nina. Swirling around the country estate are characters who reflect Konstantin's pain and suffering in their own harshly realistic ways. In this famed play, Chekov introduces a brand new form of literature as to emphasize characters other than plot. Instead of placing characters beneath a steady frame, Chekov lets his characters guide the subtle movement of the sad tale of devastated dreams and hopes. The dying sea gull symbolizes the emptiness of defeat and further stressing the beauty of life. The fullness of being simply alive comes beaming with power and touches life.
561	A little misleading in description: First off this movie is described as a comedy and a drama, though theres not much of the former. That being said the movie is like an Iraqi Lord of the Flies. It's acting is good and the plot line is mystical. Turtles is a great Iraqi movie.
562	Mackinac Maze: Especially recommended for readers who know the Straits of Mackinac area of Michigan. Very clear and detailed descriptions. Most landmarks and business enterprises are identified by their correct names. The somewhat involved mystery plot holds your interest right to the end.
563	How nice this book is!: I'm very satisfied with this book. We can learn a lot of useful words from this book. I use English as the second lungage. I want to recomand you to use this book if you want to learn the particles with the their verbs.
564	Can't go wrong: Holds a ton of stuff. I just bought my third one. Two in the basement and one in the garage. Better than Rubbermaid and others I have seen. Piece of cake putting it together.
565	Horrble: This is a horrible book. Mental abuse is all this is. You will assure your child years of therapy if you follow this book.
566	The Definitive Gong Album: Buy it if you can find it. I know this may say cliche but they don't make music like this anymore.
567	Irate fan of heroes: I was hoping for something scholarly along the lines of Stephen Ambrose. Instead, the heroes' stories get short shrift for the political rants against those opposed to the war. What has that got to do with the heroes' fetes??? Instead of letting the heroes' voices tell the stories of their wartime experiences, the whole book is flawed with political hacking. I could care less about the politics of the war. I want to hear how well Americans have upheld our heritage as people who care for others as well as comrades, and will go to extraordinary lengths to achieve their goals. I didn't complete the book. I thought it was disgusting.
568	cheapo: The power switch has not worked properly ever at all (not once). You have to jiggle and go all turny with it to make it work.It is disgusting it ships with such a defective switch.--- BIG NEWS ___ UPDATE ___ READNOW ---The switch no longer works at all! I repeat: the gosh-blarged switch no longer functions at all.Dear Adesso,I hate you.Yours aplenty,xxx
569	Worst i've seen in dragon ball z: Worst movie. I think this one is not near as good as the earlier movies. Broly whoops everybody, but goku at the end beats him with a regular punch? what happened to ending them with a spirit bomb or kamehameha? the music is actually really good. not worth $20. First 3 movies are the best. but, it is dragonball z. but this movie is long and boring, and that is why i give it a 2 out of five.
570	Only has Eight (8) Phone Connection Limit!: There is a very small detail I overlooked when purchasing this product. It can be found in VERY small print at the bottom of the box:"DataPilot software is for personal use only, therefore you can connect and transfer data to a maximum of 8 different mobile phones."WHAT?!?!?!? THE KIT COMES WITH 10 CABLES!! AND YOU ARE TELLING ME I CAN ONLY USE UP TO 8 OF THEM!!!!I bought this thinking I could use it on my friends and family's phones to help them out too.I did my research before buying but missed this VERY big point.Only get this if you intend to ever connect 8 or less devices. Otherwise you will be VERY disappointed.
571	One of the worst books I've ever read: Such a waste of money! The writing is horrible, the advice is ludicrous. The gist of this book - live a life of complete irresponsibility and selfishness at the expense of others....and (as another reviewer noted) THINK ABOUT YOUR PRIVATES.There are many other books to encourage mindful sensuality and pleasure. This one is a waste of space.
572	One of the finest outdoor/adventure films I have ever seen: This is one of those rare films that regardless if you participate in the activity it is promoting or not, you will find something that appeals to you.You do not have to be an angler to appreciate this film-It is an entertaining, awe inspiring and educational film.The camera work is top notch and the scenery is mind blowing.If you enjoy the outdoors at all, to any degree, you must buy this DVD. If you are into photography, biology, botany or, last, but most certainly not least,fishing, you must buy this DVD.I own many outdoor related, hunting and fishing videos and DVD's and this is the best film of it's kind I have ever seen. Actually, it is in a class by itself. I have never seen a fly fishing film that comes close to the quality of this film.Two Thumbs up!!!!!
573	HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!: very suprisingly poorly made toy and not for the age they have specified...possible would work for much older. The colors make a big mess, small pieces are easily lost/hard to keep in order and the pens dont write very well when you wet them. If I didnt get this online and we hadnt made a MESS of it trying to work it, you can bet it would have been returned because Im very unhappy with this purchase!!!
574	Ok for rank beginners: I have always struggled with lighting. I hoped this book would help me, but it didn't. I'm very frustrated by the lack of good lighting books out there.If you know nothing of MAX or lighting, then this book will probably be of some use to you, but if you want to learn advanced lighting techniques, this book isn't for you.
575	Give 'Em The Finger: 'Fingerprints' is the first album to attepmt to compile all of Powderfinger's singles onto one disc. It is, without a doubt, a fantastic compilation. However, its only downside is the fact that the compilation only dates back to 2000. This means that the songs from the 'Finger's most recent album (and arguably the best), 'Vulture Street', are left of it.Yet there is something here for everyone, from Internationalist's roaring 'Don't Wanna Be Left Out', to the sombre tones of 'These Days'. The stand-out tracks are Odyssey's huge hit 'My Happiness' and the new single 'Bless My Soul'.It could've been beyond brilliant if some of the better non-singles were included, but hey, you can only wish for so much. Fingerprints is a great introductory album to the work of Powderfinger.
576	very disappointed: Initially was very pleased with the blower functionality. The vacuum mulched very well and had good suction for an electric, although the flared out vacuum nozzle left it prone to frequent clogs. The bad news, after only 1 and a half seasons of light use, it burned up - as in started smelling hot and by the time I got it shut off it was pouring smoke. Thought it might have been the variable switch, but on ivestigation found the fiberglass mount for the motor brushes completely burned up allowing one of the brushes to jam in the motor. Overall, really great performance the first few times you use it, but in the long run, a disappointing fire-hazzard.
577	DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM: dont buy this wack album. For one, Jive records has F*cked over UGK for years and years, and this is another attempt to swindle the pockets of the greatest rap group of all time. Jive knows that they can't make any more money from them and now that the rest of the nation is finally giving them their credit, Jive is trying to capitalize on that profit. If you want to hear UGK Screwed the way it should be. Get a SCREW TAPE. A DJ Screw original. Hit up Screwed Up Records N Tapes at 713-731-0747 and get the real deal. RIP DJ SCREW -- FAT PAT FREE PIMP C
578	Don't waste your money, buy an IPOD: You know how everyone is comparing this, as well as all other mp3 players, to the apple IPOD? Well there is a reason. The Ipod offers features that the others can't fathom, and has the reliability and customer service that one expects when making a large purchase such as this.My Rio is fine, but when comparing it to the Ipod I was only dissapointed. I cannot get an FM transmitter, and the file organization is pathetic in comparison. The case is awkard, and I only have one choice for cases. And of course, the interface itself on it just is not up to par. The Ipod has obviously been refined time and time again, and they have a very polished product. The Rio Carbon may be a good item in a couple generations, but they have a long way to go. The battery life is the one advantage that it holds over the Ipod, and that is a nice feature.In short, if you are going to spend this much money, you might as well buy a quality product such as the Ipod.
579	Great Little Outlet Expander: I bought this for a room that had the bottom outlets on switch. I needed more outlets that were not running on the room switch so this did the trick. It plugs into the top receptacle on the outlet and gives you great access to 6 outlets (giving you a total of 4 new outlets). It fits nice and flush to the wall plate and looks great. By screwing it directly to the outlet, you avoid any potential of this falling off the wall - nice addition.
580	Great doll but.......: I wanted a tattoo! and my jade doesn't have a tattoo. She is very beautiful though. Probably one of the most prettiest jades out there.
581	One of the best movies of the decade!: Do not be deceived by the poor box office gross of this film. Nor be persuaded by the critics lambasting of ARLINGTON ROAD. Starring Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins (two of Hollywood's most underrated actors), this psychological thriller will blow you away (no pun intended). While the first half may seem slow, it's all building up to an edge-of-your-seat conclusion that will make your jaw drop. ARLINGTON ROAD may seem like it was all given away in the trailers. Listen well, reader: it was not. After seeing it three times, I feel I find new intracacies each time. ARLINGTON ROAD is a tale of modern-day paranoia, and it will leave you questioning yourself about what to believe and not to.
582	Police Business: Although a bit hokey at some points (see "Jamaican in New York"), this album rocks! Liking the Police is one thing, Regatta Mondatta takes it to the next level. The twisted and turned harmonics, along with lyrics which have been given an "irie" feel make this a welcome addition to any pop-reggae listeners.
583	Fool me once...: Sorry, New Line. I already played the buy the Theatrical's then buy the Extended's game with the original DVD release. Not doing it a second time with the Blu Ray. I can wait for the Extended Versions. And if they never come out them, then no Blu Ray for me at all.
584	awesome, trippy documentary: I originally saw this show on TV and had to buy it on blu-ray as a birthday present for my brother. The picture on our 50" plasma is amazing and with the surround sound it sounds great. I never realized that Alec Baldwin had such a good voice for this type of work. Although I must say, after watching this I have never felt so miniscule and un-important in the universe!
585	Really interesting bio.: The guy is actually more of a cheat with 3 card monte than a poker player. If you ever saw Rounders this guy is Worm not Knish. Great read though. This guy lived a high live. According to wiki he was broke on the end.
586	Narnia by the Book: This video reflects almost exactly the era from whence it came. I am fully satisfied with it. It gets across the point that Mr. Lewis intended in such a manner that almost anyone can understand it and without the modern day meaness and vulgarity exhibited in todays video offerings.
587	a let-down from Maeve: Having read all of Maeve's books, this one was truly disappointing, one-dimensional and shallow. The characters were neither believable nor particularly likeable. Very contrived story. Her best asset in the early books was to make the characters so empathetic, likeable, believable and fallible too. Her story lines were so wonderful - they made you think how natural the lives of the characters were. I couldn't wait for the next Binchy book to come out. Sorry, this one just did not do it for me at all.
588	DANGEROUS GROUND: I saw the movie more time then I can think of. The only sad part about the soundtrack it does not have the one song I was looking for that is sung in Zulu. It is also does not have other songs on the soundtrack there were used in the movie.
589	Not Stephen King!: The reviewers on the back of Moore's first book in this series talk about him being the next Stephen King. Not even close. His idea is a bit 'done before', but that's not really the main problem. Where King creates well-rounded characters, Moore simply gives you a cardboard cutout of the person and then kills them off two chapters later. There's so many characters, it's hard to figure out who is who BECAUSE they aren't well-developed. And because the story is all for shock value ie: many people killed, but we're not really quite sure why (except for the husband of the woman killed as a witch), you quickly lose interest.I bought the first and the second ones in the series together, but wouldn't buy any further books. Stephen King makes people think that writing these kind of books easy. Stephen King, however, is a master storyteller, which definitely shows up when you see the difference between any of his books and something like this.
590	Did not perform at all!: Very disappointed. Did not work at all. Will buy the name brand now. Dont' make the same mistake.
591	Waste of money: Like many other people, I bought this book on the overall rating given by other readers. To say I was stunned and disappointed is an understatement. I have been following a celtic spiritual path for many years and druidry for some time now. I have read countless books on the subject and found this to be one definitely not worth reading if you really want to follow the druid path. Take other reviewers' advice and take a look at John and Caitlin Matthews or better still, find a local group and learn from experience. This book is really not worth your money or time.
592	Exchanged 3 times and none continued to work: I bought this printer because I always have been an HP user. I especially wanted this model because it had the memory stick capability without having to use my computer.The first one didn't work at all, so I exchanged for another on Helpdesk's advice. The second one worked until I tried to print wallets, then the photo reader failed and stopped working.The third one didn't read memory stick at all.HP support was not knowledgeable and offered no help. Supervisor was supposed to address my problems, but never called me back to compensate me for all the paper and photo cartridge expense.Then I bought another HP, different model, because I thought I would give it another chance. That had horrible print quality, so I am going to try an Epson.
593	WHERE IS MY BOOK???????????????: I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS BOOK YET - I'M STILL WAITING - CAN YOU SEND ANOTHER BY FEDEX OR UPS SO IT CAN BE TRACED BETTER THAN WHAT IS OFFERED BY THE POST OFFICE???????
594	pretentiously overcooked: People who think this is a great samurai movie aren't dumb, just deluded. Mifune bought the story for himself, probably thinking he could equal Kurosawa's humanist insight. That's not shameful; but the story ain't that good. The buildup takes forever, and the main plot device is lame beyond belief. Film students will love this, but not real people. This is to samurai cinema as Shane is to Westerns, beautifully produced, over-earnest and bloated, larded with the cliches rather than the vigor of the genre.
595	Easy: This fits the vehicle, is easy to install and take out when ready to wash.The fabric can be a little warm for the dog in the extreme summer, but otherwise worth the money.
596	AWWWH YEAH Kickass: Great cd. I prefer the live version of This Kids, but what a jewel. This was a hard cd to get, but it was certainly worth the wait. Another great UFO cd is UFO1. They are all great. Also OLD SCORPIONS like LONESOME CROW, IN TRANCE, FLY TO THE RAINBOW, ANIMAL MAGNETISM, and VIRGIN KILLER are definitely a MUST for any SCHENKER/ ULI ROTH collector
597	Simplistic, worthless and mistake-ridden.: This book is completely worthless. You are better off reading the documentation in ColdFusion about components. The examples are very simplistic and do not help to address why and how to use components in real-world applications.There are also dozens of mistakes, including spelling, grammar and in the code examples which often make the examples difficult to follow. The numbered paragraphs are useless and seem to serve primarily as a way to increase the number of pages in the book. (If you do not include the code examples, this book probably contains only about 20 pages of writing.)If you do buy this book, I implore you to skip the "Closing Thoughts" section which is an imaginary conversation between 3 developers that rambles on for 10 pages yet says nothing of value.I will say the book is aptly titled: it helps you "discover" CFCs, but it does little to make them useful. I am considering sending this book back and asking for a refund. It's that bad.
598	can not compete with the closer: the series is not as good as the closer. It;s a sad thing that the closer is not there anymore. Main character is bad
599	Talented Singer -- (From a forever fan) :): Faith Hill to me is a very talented singer. I love her songs; they're simply inspiring, and beautiful. Well written too. This cd will not dissapoint any TRUE fan of Faith Hill. If you love her voice (who wouldn't??), then you will be overjoyed with this soundtrack. Faith always puts her best into her work. She works hard, has a wonderful family, and earns what money she gets by singing till her heart's content. We should all be so lucky.God bless Faith Hill!
600	A Shame: It is a shame David Garza does not have more recognition. He certainly deserves it. I saw Discoball World on TV and was hooked on the song. I took a chance in buying this C.D. and it payed off. Garza's songs are easy to listen to; they drift like a cool breeze through the ears. In a world where corporate pop acts dominate the radio, we could sure use somone like Garza to be played as well. He gives some much-needed respectability back to popular music.
601	A fascinating story: A fascinating story about the relationship between an older woman and a little girl. The author weaves the story by going from the past to the present chapter by chapter. You soon learn the story of the older woman's life and why it is so important that she now has this little girl in her life.
602	Season 2: Big thumbs up to the people who make this show. It just proves that you can make a decent childrens show that keeps children entertained and not have a lot of "flash"
603	Warning : This is done on a set like a play and not like a movie.: This may be well written and done as far as plays go. If you are expecting a traditional movie you may be disappointed.This is done on a college type set with some props etc. The picture posted is misleading. I should have read the reviews but made a quick decision. Oh well, if you like school plays you might like it as long as you know up front what it is.
604	Panasonic DMW-LND52: This is a really nice filter, I have no vignetting, does not create color aberration or alter the color of the picture. I definitely recommend this filter.
605	M. Night Shymalan...ugh.: I stayed far away during its theatrical run because M. Night Shyamalan's name was attached. And the last good movie he made was Unbreakable ten years ago. I decided to give it a rent anyway and it wasn't even worth the $3 I spent. The twist wasn't even a shock because I wasn't invested in the characters or the story. I was just bored. I'm glad it was only a little over an hour long (hour and fifteen minutes to be exact).
606	Stick with the Vx: m500 Not Compatible: This is a very nice unit... a Vx with added storage capacity. At least it LOOKS like a Vx, but in fact Palm has changed it just enough so that the accessories and peripherals from the V-series don't fit. Jackets, stylos, cradles, etc. will have to be bought new (some of which are only now coming out). Worse (for me)... I only discovered after buying it that the m500 series uses a (faster) USB cradle which does not work for Windows 95 or NT users. You have to buy an extra (slower) cable/cradle. This planned obsolescence is disappointing.
607	Excellent except for the missing tracks: I have seen Sarah in concert several times and thoroughly enjoyed Harem; however, I am disappointed with the CD only because it excludes the title track. Fans of Sarah often have to wait long periods for any new material and we eagerly anticipate new offerings. Ultimately, this CD is a must have for true fans who are rarely disappointed by Ms. Brightman. As for the comparison to Madonna and Cher, Sarah outsings and outperforms anyone.
608	Best thing ever happed to me: Personally, this book had a tremendous impact on me. One of three best books I ever read. In general, a very well narrated story, with lots of depth. A must read for someone trying to find oneself or feeling completely misunderstood by others.
609	A wonderfull classic: I am a professor of Chemical Engineering with emphasis in chemical reactors and related subjects. I own this booh since 1977 (!) and it remains with me all the time. It is, for the time it was published, the best book ever written on Chemical Reactor Analysis. It has modeled the domain language, through its precision of definitions. It has also modeled the domain itself, through the precision of its mathematical language . I recommend it to every ungraduate and graduate student of Chemical Engineering.
610	do not waste your time: Usually my husband picks the movies and he does a good job, but even if this movie has some good actors playing in it....it sucked. I was tempted to stop watching after 20 minute, but I kept watching just to see how bad it was, and it was pretty bad. Do not waste your time, it is so boring...Too many good things to do, than waste your time watching this movie.
611	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS: I got this CD thinking it had the original songs that I heard on the radio stations; however, it's not. Many of the songs are remakes that sound horrible. I have never heard worse versions of I want candy, take my breath away, every rose has its thorn, and stray cat strut. They are horrible. Flashdance (what a feeling) and bang on the drum all day aren't as bad as the others above, but they aren't great either. The other songs were recorded live so they are bearable, but overall I would not pay fifty cents for it.I strongly recomend that you do not get this album!!
612	Hammer films long awaited titles released on DVD!: Any fan of Hammer films and/or Christopher Lee cannot wait to snatch up this rare item. Be aware casual Hammer Film fans these are not Horror films but action/adventure. Many familiar Hammer actors and directors. So if you are a completist of the Golden Age of Hammer like myself,snatch up this DVD collection.
613	whatdaheck?!!: unreal. most boys if they had a chance to spend time with a hot little number in the woods would be playing doctor or strip oker, no fighting made-up monsters. if the kids were younger-- 6 or 7 if would be more believable.
614	Incredibly Awful: While my experience with Sleater-Kinney really only goes back to "The Hot Rock," I have to say all the reviews I had read of this album's endless eclecticism must have been the product of payola (a.k.a music biz bribes). If you enjoy the sound of guitars being hurled against a wall, you'll be in heaven. Otherwise, dig around for "The Hot Rock," and hope it was all a bad dream...
615	loving new ways to cook: this is a great product, it heats very well, pasta is always done to perfection and it cleans up with minimal effort. love it
616	A waste of money: A libertarian screed on the Civil War with very few sources and very slanted to the southern view of History.Would not recommend to anyone, not even my worst enemy!!
617	The green cover: I was the designer for that release, the original artwork was lost. No it is't a bootleg, Cleopatra had to re-release it.Carl Edwards
618	Sterling Audio Shockmount: Pretty good little holder. Just be careful as the plastic screw that mounts to the microphone is a little shallow and make me nervous mounting this inverted.
619	the set up: While "Path of Daggers" is just a bunch of fluff compared to books 1-7, Jordan used it to set up book 9. Will Elayne get her throne? Will Egwene get the White Tower? Is Mat dead or a Seanchan prisoner? How will Faile get herself out of the mess she's in? Will Rand stop hating Aes Sedai and realize that he and the Asha'man are male Aes Sedai? Who is the Daughter of the Nine Moons? Will marriage soothe Nynaeve's grumpy soul? We wouldn't be able to ask many of these questions without book 8. Jordan has had two years to ponder the plots of book 9. Let's keep our fingers crossed that "Winter's Heart" isn't a set up for book 10.
620	not so great: one of the images didn't match so it will never make sense to my daughter. I'm sure if it did match it would be a great toy.
621	Hard to Understand: I found the author's principles difficult to grasp. I was expecting a method that was easier to understand. For the price that is being charged for this book, I expect the method to be more clearly stated.
622	Join the Plan: Anyone expecting this to be another Pantera album will be seriously disapointed. Anyone that is a Pantera fan and realizes that there was more to the band than Phil Anselmo will enjoy this album. While there are Pantera-esque songs on the record (Breathing New Life, New Found Power) there is also alot more diversity to be found. There are slower tracks (Soul Bleed) and even some nu-metal sounding tracks (F**k You, Blink Of An Eye). There is something here for everyone, if you don't like a song skip it. My only complaints are that the band seemed to lack direction in the sound that they were trying to achieve. I liked the slower more melodic stuff and the heavier stuff equally but please, cut out all the nu-metal elements for the next album, it sounds cheesy. My only other complaint is that some of Pat Lachman's vocals don't sound up to their potential. But overall this is a pretty damn good debut. Dimebag and Vinnie Paul fans, you owe it to yourselves to pick up this album!
623	Crack Casing!!!: Yes. I opened immediately when UPS delivered the window fan and it got a severe crack casing!!Got to return to Target minus off my shipping charges! Sad!
624	Think Like A Man: I love Steve...Great Movie!!! I read his book and the movie was centered around them. The cast was great...waiting on"think like a man 2" ...
625	clinton Anderson 's techniques: I found that I could not put this book down and read it cover to cover ..twice so far! And then I lent it to a friend and she read it in one nite. We both like Clintons approach and look foreward to spring to use on our horses. Very informative and useful book and I really liked the comparison of the two riders and their specific problems. I only wish the book was in a smaller format with a ring binder to bring out in the barn with me when I ride.
626	Gotta let it grow on you: First of all, this isn't a Barenaked Ladies album. You have to know that when you get it. (Although you probably haven't heard of this if you don't like Barenaked Ladies).The first time through this cd I noticed a few catchy tunes and a few songs that I thought I'd never get to like, but each time I listen to it again I like it more. So, don't give up after the first listen, or you'll be missing some great music.Glitterbug is, in my opinion, the best song on the album. Short, clear and super-sweet, with some beautifully simple music.The fact that this album exists at all makes me wonder what's wrong with these songs that the Barenaked Ladies didn't want to use them, because the feel of most of the music and lyrics is the same. Maybe Stephen Page felt these were more personal somehow, or maybe the rest of the band didn't like them. Whatever the reason, it's worth picking up the cd while we're waiting for another Barenaked Ladies cd to come out.
627	Great group even live...: I bought my tickets for the No Doubt/Paramore concert and I knew the sounds were gonna be there so I listen to a few tracks. I feel in love with them!! So I was really expecting them at the concert. I was disappointed they only sanged a couple of songs but to make it up, I bought myself their album. I strongly recommend their albums. They can sing and they have unique music. They're amazing!!!!
628	I tried it and it is ok from an artists point of view: I bought this purposely for drawing. It came and well it was really small like a mouse pad and the area to draw in was really small. It worked for me about 3 months. Since I travel alot with it it was used daily and the USB wires will go if you aren't careful. It won't work now due to the reason of traveling with it. I would suggest this for a home type tablet and not for the artist type out there. For the artist out there..get a bigger one and a different brand.
629	yum yum is not porno: I am Michelle Daw,the star of this little film..We shot this in two weeks on a shoestring budget...that shows...they keep spelling my name wrong...
630	The Must-Have Kitchen Reference: This is the essential for every kitchen. For every wedding, I include it as an essential adjunct to whatever useless item the blissfully ignorant couple has registered. Need to know what a particular cut of beef is, how to clean clams, how to make Bearnaise sauce, and what is tripe anyway? The entire array of a lifetime of cooking questions is here. I still have mine after 30 years.
631	Outstanding and well-researched: This is a fabulous book that is well-worth your money. Mr. Cruz Smith takes his Russian protagonist to a new, diverting and thoroughly researched venue -- modern-day Cuba in its "Special Period." It's a delight to read this intelligent, well-written book. Congratulations!
632	worst and bad company: Don't ever order any from this people.Waiste the time and money.Please customers don't get caught in to this people. report them to amazon and remove them from their list.
633	Just what it says it is.: It's a big spatula, firm, well made, quite a stiff blade, and ideally suited for things like cake baking. Recommended.
634	Easy to use if you pay attention.: I would recommend this opener to anyone who can understand instructions....saw several people trying to use it like a traditional can-opener and getting frustated. When used properly it is easy, relaxing and efficient. Great product, rugged too!
635	you can get dvd for 20 bucks, new, other places: I wanted a dvd of this to show my class, and was sad to see the price so high here. I googled it once and found it through other places for 20 bucks.
636	You need less testosterone and less beer, Fred.: Lame. That's the best I can describe Limp Bisquik's new album. Even the front cover design has the typical macho male boorishness we've come to despise. I know Kurt Cobain certainly despised the type of machismo Durst oozes. In all irony, can you believe Durst actually has a tattoo of Cobain on his chest? Neither could I, but on VH1, he showed it. As for the CD... well, Durst ain't called Limp for nothing.
637	Italian Army 1940-45 (v-1): Very good read with a ton of information and many great pictures and illustrations that help you understand the subject. Much more information than was expected in this book. It complements the other volumes on this subject.
638	Like A Toad With A Cough: Her voice is far too husky and choked up. Her lyrics stink.Wish I could return this album. She sounds a little like a female Bob Dylan, Johhny Cash but with a bad headcold.
639	Masterful use of the Orchestra: The Symphony in Waves is one of the most sensuously orchestrated works of the last two decades, reminding one of early John Adams, although the musical language is different. Rautavaara with an American sound is the way I'd describe it. I have listened to this CD 5 times and even given it to friends. This is not music to Break New Grounds, but manages to have a distinctive personal sound, something to admire in an era of sound-alike composers.
640	What does this thing ??: WHOOOOOOOOOWW! This thing is really expensive. 12000$!!!!??? Damn!!I dont care what this thing does, with that price you could buy yourself like 3 Vsr snipers, and a Vsr shoots at the same velocity than that this gun. The only reason this gun should cost that is that the motor is made from gold and the piston head from diamond, but i doubt that. After all, it only shoots at 320, so i dont know why this gun costs so much. I think someone who wrote the price on the sellers page of this gun fell asleep on top of the "0" button, lol!! No way this gun should cost that much.
641	This book totally makes the cool club: I love all the stuff Mary-Kate and Ashley have out.This bbok is fun-filled!It's Definitally up to style and up to date!I can't wait to read the next one.Summary is: At white oaks academy theresa new girl at school.She's popular and has the highest teck stuff!She also has a club.She trys to get Mkanda to join by doing things to get them in trouble.But now she's gone to far?*READ THIS TODAY!
642	GOOD FOR THE LAYMAN AND THE LEARNED: A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT IS PUT IN, TO GUIDE THE READER THRO THE PRE-SAP & POST SAP SCENARIOS.I RECOMMEND READERS TO READ THIS BOOK NOT ONCE BUT AS MANY TIMES POSSIBLE SINCE EVERY TIME YOU READ YOU GET A NEW INTERPRETATION OF SAP. GOOD BUY..
643	"war" crime: This is a very uneven album. Some of the covers are excellent, including a powerful version of "why can't we live together" and a charming cover of "everybody is a star." But reducing the muscular anti-war classic "war" to a lounge-lizard crooner is nothing short of an atrocity. Osborne also makes the curious choice to eliminate the melody lines from two songs - Aretha Franklin's "think," and the Band's "the weight", with fairly alientating results.
644	Wanksta: This Movie should be great for 50 fans, but i must warn you, this is a "wanksta" dvd. 50 Cent grew up in the hood, he got shot, so what? I was not overwelmed by any of this, IF U ARE A REAL RAP FAN, do not get this DVD. Its Just a young punk trying 2 be funny and show kids how gunshots and weed make you cool. But if your that 50 cent fan, warin a wife beater smokin a joint in yo lowrider kickin it wit tha homies while drinkin a 40, then u are welcome 2 it.
645	sorry excuse for both a novel and a history of philosophy: I would've given this book 0 stars... This is a [bad] novel, and drags as a philosophy text. Sophie is just there as an excuse to make this book more than just a textbook. I thought I was reading just another text on philosophy, instead of an interesting novel... Do you honestly want to listen to this: "Kant also formulates the 'categorical imperative' in this way..." yada yada, yawn...boring!I think gaarder, honestly, should've just written a plain philosophy textbook because that way, you get what you expect: long philosophical departures and notions. Because gaarder attempted to lodge all this philosophy into a novel, he ends up producing a failure--a failure at a book as well as a failure as a philosophy text. Do not buy or read this book unless your philosophy professor forces you to do so.
646	waffle maker: Excellent product. But, I later found out I could have purchased it cheaper at Bed n Bath with their 20% off coupon. I am still happy with my hassle free purchase.
647	A must read.: J.r. Rowling has done it again.Harry potter has captured my sons and I imagination ! You cant help become imersed in Harry's world.All the characters (Ron,Hermione Hagrid,ect) have become more dimensional and quite lovable. The story line keeps you in total suspense! I love the way she portraits the ghost (Headless nick,Moanning Myrtle) they where my sons favorites..The whole book is just magical. We cant wait to see what happens to Harry next in 'Prisoner of Azkaban"! Harry potterbooks are a must read for those who love the world of Magic.These books have begun the love of reading ,to my son, and that is a great gift. Plus we have so much to talk about now!
648	Cinematic Cancer: I can understand trying to make a quick buck off of combining 3 movies, but at least put forth an effort before producing and distributing cinematic cancer. The special effects, story, acting, and editing are all horrific. This movie is the Matrix meets Transformers on an incredibly small budget. Machines take over the planet accept for one "undisclosed" settlement for humans. The machines (TransFORMers) begin to close in on this location (terribly compared to Zion) and so they must engage (something like that of Starship Troopers). Please do not make the same mistake that I did by wasting any amount of time on this poisonous shred of leftover, already been done much better by real studios piece of trash.
649	never recieve: I ordered this like over a month ago, and still hasn't been sented out.. I wonder why? Im still waiting to hear back when they would send it out
650	not impressed: my last pair of guy cottens lasted 10 years without a problem, these lasted 4 months and got a hole in the seat already. they're not even coated inside, it's just straight canvas that absorbs fish offal. they are comfortable though.i recommend doing yourself a favor and paying the extra $30 for a pair of guy cottens, totally worth it.
651	JUNK weather radio: My next door neighbor & I bought the same model WR300. We live less than 10 air miles from National Weather Station in Chanhassen, MN. The storms came & the city of Chaska alarms went off, but not the radio. We each live in a 2 story house. Radio said check location for signal. We went all over the houses, upstairs, in front of windows & porch. No luck. Save your money & don't buy this product. Computer, cellphone and TV are better options.
652	Terrible acting and no story ruin the good effects.: What an awful waste of time. Tom Cruise did a better acting job in Risky Business. There was some good visual stuff, but it just doesn't salvage the non-existant story and all around bad acting.
653	Fan: Skip this one: I read the reviews that wrote that Havers and Lynley were MIA in this book and the books main focus was on Deborah and Simon St. James - who are uninteresting characters in the best of times - but I refused to believe I waited like 2 years for a new Lynley George book and I got stuck with this! For shame Ms. George - to deprive your readers of one of the great mystery characters, especially a woman, to have come around in a long time. Hint: the PBS series is based on Havers and Lynley, not Deborah!!! Take my word for it George fans: skip this book as it might put you off for good!!!
654	Leapfrop Learning DVDs 5-pack: My son loves these videos and they have increased his reading skills tremendously in the few weeks we have had them.
655	Item Description: The Amazon product description states the crochet hooks to be 8.8 inches long. In reality, the length is nearly 7.0 inches. While the size of the hook is adequate, the length is not. I have ordered these items from both JoAnn and eSticker. All the hooks (sizes M and N) were only 7 inches long, and not the 8.8 inches stated. Also, the small image does not covey much of the detail of the crochet hooks.
656	difficult loading, using and restoring: After loading some songs for my granddaughter, her mother couldn't add or delete using her computer. I tried to find out what the problem could be, but the Itune software was corrupted and after reloading (which a lenghty process) I still had problems with the ipod. So I didn't loose any of her songs I tried to backup to disc ((dvd), all I got was a ruined disc which could be read. I spent too much time now on this, I probably have to call the 800 number and talk to some guy in Singapur. The online help pages are useless, very unorganized....their main interest is to sell you some I-Tunes.
657	beautiful,beautiful: crazy/ beautiful is one of those rare movies that show unconditional love at it's best.To accept someone in spite of there faults,and short comings, to see the goodness in someone even if they don't see it them self.It's also reckless yet sane. It was only attraction in the beginning but, it turned into something that couldn't be torn apart.Crazy/beautiful is teaches you that love never fails and over comes all obstacles even ourselves.lovely, crazy yes, but beautiful, beautiful.bravo!Crazy/ Beautiful
658	Not as expected...: I gave this two stars because I felt sorry for Violaine Corradi. This is definetely not the Corradi I was expecting. If you want to listen to his better works, listen to Dralion! Varekai is not what I expected from a Cirque CD. I'm very disappointed.
659	Originality: Definately one of the more original hip-hop recordings of the past decade. Back in the spring/summer of '94 we were banging "Diary of a Madman" all over S.I. If there ever was a category for "scariest" hip-hop track, "Diary" takes it (one of the best Rza tracks of all time, it still gives me chills) It's like the soundtrack to a murder spree. Also worth noting about "Diary", it's the first appearance of the Killah Priest, the most underrated lyricist ever. Oh yeah, the rest of the album ain't too bad either. If you're reading this and don't own this album, DO WHAT YA GOTTA DO TO GET IT.......NOW!
660	Cacophonic: Caca most certainly but not music!What a poor excuse for it.This is nothing more than noise! Definitely my top ten worst buys!This would be equivalent to Industry's Bang A Can.....pure rubbish!!
661	Regret: For years I have told the tale of how I "learned" multiplication. I told people they showed us pictures like mom and pie and mom times mom equaled pie and so forth. It has been the subject of many laughs. I cant believe I found the actual program! Our school tested this on my class in school. I still don't know my multiplication tables! Theres a reason our teachers tried it on us and then never ever used it again, because it doesn't work and its ridiculous. Kids need to start memorizing when they are young because its all they are gonna do for the rest of their lives. Dont get this program.
662	True craftsmanship: What a beautiful display of true Architecture for Architectures' sake. Yeah, you may need a bit of $$ to personally afford buildings with this calibur of workmanship, but it will be well worth it and timeless. Builders and purchasers of todays' Suburb homes need to look to great works like these to realize the real issue of urban sprawl.Great book. Great photo's. Great ideas. Great craftmanship. Outstanding architecture.
663	I object: The thing that bothers me about some critics is that they fail to consider the technology and the time the movie was made. I find somethings humourous, but as a whole it is a quality movie for 1935. Those of us who were kids when these movies were first seen on TV, were able to use our imaginations and be much more creative than many of today's hi tech kids. It is all relevant. It was great for it's day and should be considered as such. If we are unable to accept that today's movies will be jokes to our grandchildren, then perhaps we should not watch anything older that a year or so and remain comfortable within our little narrow boxes.
664	Not so good advice: I read this book last summer and used it with the man I was dating, and he almost dumped me!There are some good points in here, about not compromising your value, and being confident in yourself.But then the parts about not showing emotion and showing your true self is just bad advice. Showing your emotions sometimes shows authenticity.To be combative, manipulative and treat a relationship like a game of chess is selfish and unloving. I believe these tactics work great on men with low self esteem, but not on confident, successful, quality men.Read at your own risk!
665	Impressed: I have only had this for about a month but so far it's been wonderful. It's very easy to use and has amazing quality. I noticed another reviewer mention how the printer cartridges run out quickly and I have already noticed that but otherwise it is great.
666	What a waste of time and money!: Like many people I was eagerly awaiting the release of 'Easy' as I had been more than impressed by the Kelly Willis' earlier albums. The reality, however, bordered on the shocking - shockingly bad. The album starts blandly and gets worse, it's not 'easy' it's comatose. The arrrangements are sluggish and uninspired and Kelly herself seems to have little or no interest in the songs. But the greatest sin is 'Don't come the cowboy with me Sunny Jim', in which she contrives to remove any trace of irony or wit from one of Kirsty MacColl's most acerbic songs. This is not an album for Kelly Willis fans.
667	This book is complete garbage: The author is obviously in way over his head. This pathetic mockery of game theory is filled with errors. I'll only present the two most egregious ones:1.Incredibly, the author doesn't seem to realize that the probability of a major adversity (as defined in the book) is greater than or equal to the probabilty of a minor adversity. This restricts the applicable section of his model.2.The slope for determining profitable trades (according to the author's model) is given by (w+x)/(y-x). By choosing x arbitrarily close to y the slope can be infinite.Conditions 1 and 2 imply that a profitable trade on any and all stocks can be made under any market conditions with no risk whatsoever.This inept, incompetent book is so bad that it casts doubt upon the entire line of technical books from Wiley and Sons and their editorial process.
668	got me into a wilderness: I had heard so many people ravelling about this book so I had to buy it. It has been a big disappointment though. The romantic story about Elizabeth Middleton running away with the love of her life, the white mohawk Nathaniel Bonner just didn't grab my interest at all.The book is easy to read, and the language flows quite nicely, but the story is so flat, everything is so predictable. I don't even know if I will manage to finish the book - it has been on my bedside table for months now.Britt Arnhild Lindland
669	RUINED: THIS MOVIE WAS AWFUL. IT'S LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS MOVIE NEVER SAW A SINGLE EPISODE OF THE DUKES OF HAZZARD. THIS IS NOT HOW THEY ENDED UP IN HAZZARD. IF THEY HAVE WATCHED SOME OF THE ORIGINAL EPISODES OF THE DUKES OF HAZZARD, THEY WOULD HAVE NOTICED WHAT BROUGHT BO, LUKE AND DAISY TO LIVE WITH THEIR UNCLE JESSE. IF THEY ARE GOING TO TRY AND UPDATE THE MOVIES TO TODAY YOUTH, THEN THEY NEED TO WATCH SOME OF THE ORIGINAL EPISODES AND STOP TRYING TO CHANGE THE PERSONALITY OF THE CHARACTER. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYBODY WHO IS A TRUE FAN OF THE DUKES OF HAZZARD.
670	Disapointed!!!: I purchased the 512 MB Viking flash card...and 3 months later the card is no longer functional, I am in the process of getting it replaced, but there is no reason why the card should have malfunctioned so quickly. I have used it over 100 times. I had the impression Flash cards lasted a long time. I also own four 256MB flash cards from Viking and those have never given me a problem. I also like to add the 512 MB is a very slow card, much slower than the 256 MB Viking card. I recommend the 256MB compact flash card, but stay away from the 512MB. There must be a reason why Viking cards are so [inexpensive] and Lexar cards so expensive. My next purchase will be a Lexar card and I hope I wont be dissapointed again.
671	Truth in Labeling: I am a huge Bon Jovi fan. I bought this CD in Wal Mart and there was absolutely NO indication on the label that this CD was anything other than a "Greatest Hits" compilation. I was disappointed. Be warned, if you are looking for the Bon Jovi you are used to, do not buy this CD. If you want to hear them try their hand at accoustic folk/ballad style singing of the songs you are used to "rocking" to, then feel free to give it a try...I should have looked on Amazon for a description before I bought it at the store, but it was an impulse buy. Still, like I said, there should be a warning on the label that this is NOT the Bon Jovi we know...
672	Bad News Bears: The whole cast was great, but Vic Morrow and Walter Matthau were the whole movie. Vic Morrow was the greatest actor of our time. He was also a very good looking man. He was born in the Bronx like I was (that made him very special to all of usBronxites) and we are proud of one of own kind that did so well.I give the movie a five star.
673	A great research book: This is a great book for researching specific dates and performances of the Cincinnati Opera, almost 3/4 of the book is schedules. But, if you are looking for some history of the company, this book is great, also.
674	PS2 better all the way.: Okay people,listen up.Xbox is a good system and all,and has a built in memory saver(whataever its called)think of the size and memory.The things like a MONSTER.It takes up alot of room.And the memory on it is not portable ! So that does not allow you to take it to your friends house.
675	Does not fit 5d mark II: I bought these as back ups to my 5D Mark II. There is a slight difference between the two so they don't fit the original charger. Luckily, I put them to use in one of two battery grips I have.
676	loved it: Great movie. great acting...Yes the content is taboo and yes it is a dark movie...but quite entertaining from our perspective!
677	naysayers are right. download nottingham lace and forget the rest: SOAD collaboration just sounds wierd, i love some of the stuff that SOAD does; in small doses. this cd just feels off to me, i dont dig it. but nottingham lace truly is one of the best songs buckethead has ever written, truly epic.
678	Another classic in the making: I just picked up a copy of Slow Train's Illegal Cargo and without a doubt it's hottttt for this summer. Lady Z's vocals are on the button with a haunting soulful echos which captivates your entire body. Every track finds its way deep into your mind eventually exploding through your feet. I may be a bit bias on this one since Lady Z is from St.James Trinidad (West Indies). But don't just take my advice, check out any real music lover and they will tell you that THIS ONE IS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!
679	Great Product for backpacking and emergency supplies: We've used this in the packets for backpacking and keep the #10 cans on hand for emergencies. When you literally live in the middle of nowhere, Hawaii, it's important to keep supplies on hand. A 25 year shelf life is great.
680	Fandorin unweaves a very tangled web: I can only assume that the original book was just as good as the translated version - but, nonetheless, it is a very enjoyable read. It is well written, with enough clues to keep you involved and guessing. You may be able to figure out the 'right' villans as you travel this literary journey, but you won't be sure until the end, and even then, you might have a surprise or two. I've read all of the translated Fandorin books and although this wasn't my favorite, it was quite enjoyable. I anxiously await the next one. You will, too.
681	Easy to clean!: I bought this litter box about a year ago when I first got my kitten. She loves to use it and it's really easy to clean. I still have to use the scooper as the wet litter sometimes sticks to the bottom of the litter box. Other than that I'm happy with the product. I have to have two litter boxes, one for each floor of the house. My kitty doesn't want to go downstairs every time to use the litter box, so I bought one for the upstairs as well. I wish it came in other colors, blue and beige would be nice.
682	BEST BOYBAND FROM BEANTOWN: The new kids broke up when i was about 3 but i just seen some of their videos on youtube, and i have too admit they became my favorite band. I know their almost 40 and broke up 13 years ago. So.... i was born a little late. I thought Jordan was hot back then and i still think hes pretty fine today. If the NKOTB ever have a reunion concert I'd be the first one in line to by concert tickets. I don't care if I'm the only one in line. NKOTB Is better then any other boy band in the world. NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK FOREVER
683	The lost genius of Woody Shaw: This is a great album, culled from a concert / club performance, in very good sound, with Shaw`s working band w/drummer/composer Victor Lewis. This is the second album I bought with Woody Shaw on it (the other being UNITY with Larry YOUNG 5 stars...). It makes you realize what a great trumpeter / composer Shaw was and what a shame was his early demise... This is the foremost trumpeter of the seventies, and his music is the perfect (missing) link between late 60`s Miles and Trane and today`s jazz scene, which still hasn`t caught up yet IMO... A great CD.
684	THRILLED!: I was so glad to be able to find this movie on Blu ray and DVD at amazon.com. I ordered both, one for me and one for my sister. The movies came in short time and have, once again, been enjoyed by all. This is such a wonderful movie and I thrilled to add it to my collection on Blu ray. Thank you so much.Donna
685	Treo Leather Case: I am pleased with the product, ease of use and quality. Price was good and delievery was on time.
686	1st and last Ann Rule I will ever read: What a mess to read. Desperately in need of an editor and/or proofreader. Maybe 'true-crime' has lower standards for writing ability, but this book was a real chore. Extremely repetitive, excessively flowery and descriptive. Minimal suspense or insight. Why is this a story we need to read? Smacks of exploitation. According to the other reviewers not one of her best, but I will not give her a second chance.
687	b &w of a color film: the movie is high lonesome it was in the details as a b&w film but i didn't see that. now if i send it back it will cost me so i am stuck with this copy.too much trouble to send back i have not seen this sort of thing since the days of vhs tape it was common pratice then but now it's wierd.i did get the color version put out by by vci and it is excellent.so be careful and look at the product details.i would not want you to be had.
688	still terrific!: This cd has all the songs i remembered from my, uh, college days, and they are all still great. i was happy to find it after all these years.
689	To quote Eragon: "I expected more": Great actors, great marketing, great special effects. This film is not so bad, but it pretends to be so much more than it is. When we got to the talking dragon I understood why.We're spoiled with good children's movies which are fun for the grown ups as well, but this movie is a kid's movie for kids. Would have loved it when i was 12. But then I even loved the "Narnia" TV-series. Actually, the Narnia movie (2005) was kind of like this one, in my opinion. I didn't like that film either.Fantasy freaks might enjoy it as well. Maybe it should have had 3 stars, but the story is kind of dull, and I was disappointed.
690	A Thorough Work and a Useful Companion: The more I study Mordechai Cogan's 1 Kings the deeper I get into the original text and context of the book of 1 Kings and the more delighted with its content I become. The detailed but, simultaneously, concise notes while expanding the verses from a textual-cultural-historical perspective, together with a brief, but not 'shallow,' giving of comments and of some history background-wherever is necessary-prove this book to be a highly academic work, but also an easy to read tool for everybody who seeks to have a useful companion while studying the book of 1 Kings.
691	Need a holiday laugh?: A classic Christmas movie to bring some laughter and lightheartedness to the holidays. I never get sick of watching this movie.
692	Is this a child's watch?: Just received and promptly returned this watch. While it looks good, the band size might be 6", might. I have a 6 1/2" wrist and if I would have closed the clasp [big if on that one] it would probably have cut off my circulation. If you have a very slender wrist it is possible this could work for you. I am an average size, not overweight person and this wouldn't fit me.
693	Where are the instructions???: This product arrived without any instructions whatsoever. I haven't even used it. How do I know how often? How much? Do I wash it out? Leave it in????? A mystery. Totally disappointed.
694	Works well and is easy to use...: I bought this to weigh occasional packages I may need to ship from eBay etc. it's a great little scale and does everything I need including weighing envelops. The face even detaches so you can weigh large items and still see the readout.I gave it a four star because it obviously doesn't come with C batteries, but it does not even come with a power adapter, although it accepts a 9-12v at 100mA adapter. How much would it have cost to include an adapter. That's my only gripe.
695	junk: The handle of this tomahawk broke off within the first 5 minutes. A better choice to buy would be the vietnam tomahawk made by cold steel VIETNAM (TOMAHAWK). It's handle appears more traditional so even if it breaks you should be able to easily repair it.
696	Lame!!!!: This is the lamest cd ever!!!!!!!!, doug munro is wack with his less than adequate lines over simple changes..., not recommended to anyone
697	Like Killswitch but better vocals: Yeah I enjoy Killswitch Engage, however the screaming gets to me. These guys have KILLER harmonies, catchy melodies, and the vocals are a bit edgy at times, however they smooth it out. I especially like All These Things I Hate and 4 Words (To Choke Upon).Get it if you like harder stuff like Avenged Sevenfold, and Killswitch, but are looking for a more original feel.
698	well i thought it was simply amazing...: now, i'm no scholar, i'm only 18 for crying out loud, but i found this book to be absolutely amazing. all i ever knew growing up was what they taught in church, and they certainly don't teach this! but i found no contradictions between the bible and evolution. i particularly found the part about adam interesting, the whole neshama thing. i liked it so much that i bought his following book, the hidden face of god. i recommend this to anyone wanting to "broaden their horizons". the scientific jargon was sometimes hard for me to follow, but i blame that on me being young and well.. not a scientist. but for the most part it was easy to read and absolutely fascinating. makes you wonder how far the rabbit hole really goes...
699	Kennedy Paper Dolls: These are wonderful historical paper dolls, too beautiful to cut out. Ordered them for five-year-old granddaughter to play with, but she will definitely need help cutting them out.If you're looking for historical paper dolls, these are the ones! Beautifully done.
700	Only recomended for Hardcore NBA fans: Several of the short stories in this book were amusing, but its not very well put together or well written. Not to mention, you wonder if he just put whatever he could to pad the page total, telling stories about one of his teamates heating a roast beef sandwich and such leave you saying, who cares? But Jay gives you a good inside look on the NBA from his eyes.
701	Effective, but VERY bulky: While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system. I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
702	A stability ball book should have more exercises actually on the ball: As indicated by my review title, I didn't like this book. I ordered it and once I saw it I immediately returned it. About half the exercises are "on" the ball while the others are exercises simply holding the ball or putting it between the legs. It doesn't seem to take advantage of the instability or range of motion that the ball allows. The exercises may be effective but I didn't want a book where I could easily perform the exercises without the ball.
703	Contemporary Business Russian: Very good book with lots of helpful information that we were wanted. This is the only place we could find Russian business vocabulary.
704	I really wanted to love these...: For the past 10 years I have been using a pair of cheap drug store tweezers - they finally got so bad that they were impossible to use. I pluck my eyebrows and chin every single day (sometimes twice a day)so I decided to splurge and buy the best tweezers I could find. After reading various reviews I bought these over the Tweezerman - I was SO excited to get them and thought they would be amazing and that they would save me so much time! I was super disappointed - they are no better than my cheap drugstore pair, in fact, in some ways they are worse. The hairs slip right out of the tweezers - and the points are so sharp that they end up nicking my skin. Over the past couple weeks they've gotten a little better as I've gotten used to them, but really they are so not worth the $26 I paid for them! Maybe I just had unrealistic expectations?
705	One of my favorite movies. inRiverhead, N. Y. I Its a bitter sweet story.: I actually met Andre the sea lion after his retirement from the movies he was sent to the Acquarium in Riverhead, N. Y.I had a photo-op with andre, first time being kissed by a seal. Great experience!!!
706	Awesome!!!: Watching these cartoons now, I notice they are far more cheesy than when I used to watch them as a kid but they are still fun to watch.
707	AMAZING IDEAS PRESENTED IN AN UNDERSTANDABLE WAY: This book opens the mind to new ideas of how the quantum mind works. It is written for the layman and is marginally easy to understand. It weaves his personal experiences into each chapter. He presents proof of will and concienceness that has never before been presented. As a layman with no 'physics background, I was able to follow his logic through out the book. I highly recommend this book to everyone with a thurst for a connection between God and science.
708	The History of Blacks In Film: Whew! This is not a book to be read in one sitting. This is 433 pages chock-full of the history of Black actors/actresses in film. From the humble beginnings of actor James B. Lowe in Uncle Tom's Cabin to the current mass appeal of Samuel L. Jackson and Morgan Freeman, Bogle takes us on an wonderfully detailed journey that chronicles the contributions of Black actors/actresses in film. Of course, Bogle's book includes those well-known films from the bygone era, but he also notes those little known films that featured Blacks playing roles that, in most instances, were the stereotypical tom and mammy, but allowed Blacks to at least get a foot in the door to make inroads to the current day Hollywood. After reading this, you'll likely want to hit up the nearest video store to pick-up some movies that you've never seen or seen before to determine whether you now view them in a different light.
709	ripoff pure: nothing new here sony keeps redoing DATED old gamesthe action stops every time u hit the wallpower up icons dont make sense. a wavy line and a dot for speedup eh?the music suks thats the only plus for these gamesneed for speed is way better
710	Chewable Vitamin: This is the best multi-vitamin I have ever tried. First, this does not upset my stomach or make me feel queasy after I take one. This also seems to have every vitamin/mineral, etc. I will ever need in it. This tastes wonderful, a nice cinnamon apple taste. It is not too strong tasting. The other wonderful thing about this is that you can chew these, too big to swallow, so the vitamins get absorbed into your system faster. I have been taking these vitamins for over 7 years and will continue to do so.
711	Jolly Roger of a good book: Cordingly has done his homework on the subject of the pirates. The text is very informative, historically acurate, and an easy read.You will learn all there is to know about these sea rogues. The author seperates fact from fiction that helps paint a clearer picture of those who sailed under the black flag. He dispells a variety of myths that surround some of the most famous pirates including Blackbeard and Captain Kidd. Cordingly takes you back to a vanished age when pirates ruled the seas. You'll journey with them across the oceans and share in their adventures,living the life of a pirate. Tally Ho!!!
712	Breaking New Ground: This album is a haunting combination of avant garde jazz with dark gothic themes. The songs themselves range from the demented (The Respectable Gentleman) to the disturbing (Sansons Seraglio) to the moving (Ne Me Quitte Pas) to almost a Trance dance style (Cannibal Banquets). I was fortunate enough to see Exp live in LA around the time of this albums release. Their shows were always brilliantly quirky and powerful. I highly recommend this album to anyone who knows that Trent Reznor didn't invent Goth.
713	Unwatchable. Horror fans beware: I rarely leave a movie at the theaters but this was one of them. Everything about this movie is terrible. The plot, the special effects, the acting, the low carb Freddie krueger they tried to create, just all around a big giant mess. Mystery science theater should get their hands on this trainwreck.
714	DUDE! IT SUCKED!: I waited for about two whole years for that book to come out- and it was a big waste of time. I'm not going to sit around and wait anymore so Jordan needs to sit down and start cranking these things out. If Jordan had been trying to ruin the series- this was the book he would write. I'm terribly dissapointed in it and I agree that I'm not going to revisit the series for some time until its complete and I don't have to waste my time.
715	Too Confusing for Me!: For some reason I couldn't make any sense of this book. It quickly gave me a headache and I had to stop reading. Even thinking about this book makes my brain feel all twisted up. I've noticed manipulative people tend to put a lot of emotional energy behind vague and confusing words and I think that may be what's going on with this book.
716	WRONG DESCRIPTION!!!!: I am ticked off! I ordered this strictly because it showed the aspect ratio was 1.33:1, the disc they actually send you is the 2.35:1. I hate that super widescreen crap. I think i should get a refund. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!
717	feels like you know the characters: The book was a real eyeopener! It was wrote aroundwhat could happen today. It really made you feellike you knew Janie and felt what she was goingthrough.I was extremely pleased with the cleanliness of thewriting that I would not hesitate to let my 12 or 10year old daughters read. I feel it would be an experiencethat they would enjoy.I have to say it is definitely worth checking itout at the library or buying one for yourself. Itis a great book to have on hand for reading pleasureof the children.I will definitely be buy the sequel "Whatever Happenedto Janie?"
718	I'll Take Basil: This movie was bad. I loved the Basil Rathbone Holmes movies but this was not the same Sherlock. It was hard to understand their fake accents,,,after all it is an American movie. A very mild phoney accent would be fine. The plot was so thick that it started to take an effort so I didn't even finish it. I don't think every movie should be a 'no brainer' but there was too much of nonsense. I won't be buying the sequal. Downey should stick to Iron Man.
719	Took the day off work to finish it!: This is an incredible account worthy of the amazing men it chronicals. I wish that every voting-age American would read this book. I really appreciated the way Bowden went the extra mile in detailing his sources and research methods, including other writings on the subject. Wake up America - this is a look at the future of the squandering of military power on feel-good conflicts rather the defense of the US and its interests by bumbling politicians.
720	Great: I have read the entire Starbuck Series and really looking forward to seeing the next book in the series come out. This book is great and worth reading a first, second, third and even maybe a fourth time. It is full of action and suspense, that kept me reading non stop.
721	Overblown: Jackson's ego is so overinflated that true knowledge of beer is obscured by his presence. This book is boring, silly, and a waste of money. It is also, like its author, shockingly overrated.
722	Create a Calendar: Almost despaired at downloading my pictures. Once I had, it was nearly impossible to replace one - almost have to take what you can get. Very disappointing. Have one more try and then I'll send it back.
723	Horrible Service: I ordered this item as a gift requested by my son for Christmas. When it finally arrived, he opened the box and found the less expensive black sake set with no tray. In addition, the sake pitcher was broken. It was poorly packed. We had to add extra packing in order to return it.The charge for shipping was based on a weight of 6 lbs. The actual weight of the package was 1.5 lbs. according to FedEx. Even if the originally ordered item had been sent, the weight would not have been that much. If a handling fee was included in this cost, the poor packing and sloppy attention to filling the order was not worth it.I will NEVER order from this company again. Please take note, Amazon.com.
724	A fast pased love story: A refreshing read as the novel combineds relationships, tech-advances, and aliens. The social structure of the First Families is not such a far-off concept that it would be unacceptable. McCaffrey stays true to the usage of heroines (at least in the novels I have read). Yet this story, though the tech is impressive as is the "fictional sicience", is dominated by the relationships between the characters. McCaffrey has to be one of those few writers that can create very real and memorable characters. The only missing thing from the story was the lack of development in the Sh'im. Their relations with each other and the humans would have added to the depth of the novel.
725	More than double a paper subscription: The actual Washington Post costs about $4.45 a month, less than half the Kindle subscription and you actually get everything in the paper (as opposed to the incomplete Kindle version).The Kindle subscription may be good if you're out of the local area and just want the Post pushed to you (as opposed to looking at their website), or if you're such a gadgeteer that you can't stand to handle paper.As with much of the Kindle content, the cost isn't in line with a non-physical product. After all, the Kindle edition doesn't need ink or paper and doesn't need to by physically delivered.Shouldn't a Kindle edition be cheaper than the actual physical newspaper? Sadly, it's substantially more and doesn't even have all the content.
726	Amazing CD: I have been a boingo fan for a few years, yes yes... I came in late. Better late then never. This is one of their best CDs, there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been said. It is nothing like the early boingo, but it's still amazing. Isanity, Hey, Mary, Can't See (useless).... it's all top notch musicthe only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it lacks Helpless... WHY DANNY!?!? WHY!?!But still. a solid addition to my music collection
727	Save Your $$$: Typically, I go into depression after I finish a Robbins book because I know it will be years before the next. So, as soon as I saw this appear I rushed to order it.If there was a zero star rating here at Amazon, this would be too high. After 75 pages I put the book down...........Mr. Robbins, are you so hard up for money? To say this is book is pathetic is too good - shame on you for letting your fans down (way down)!
728	I like it: I like these. They def help get the dirt off your face. When I used these I make sure to but facial lotion on right after I rinse or my skin dries out. But I think it works well.
729	october baby: This was a well done movie and clean. It addresses a current issue for life and is realistic. The acting and overall cinematography was well done. Thank you for an enjoyable movie.
730	Presto 23 quart pressure canner: When comparing this Presto model to the similar All American model, the All American appears to be so much better constructed. So much so, that after placing the order I began wondering if I had done the right thing. When I received my Presto last week I was absolutely stunned as to how well it is made. For whatever reason, the pictures do not do the product justice. It works perfectly. As for the gauge accuracy issue, I also purchased the 3 piece weighted regulator set for $11.99. The regulator rocks precisely in sync with the gauge so it serves as a reliable verification. Down the road you might be looking at replacing the rubber cover seals but at LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE, choosing the Presto is a no brainer.
731	Great stories from a small town: This book is a delight to read. The stories are refreshing and surprisingly interesting. The yarns are simple, funny, charming and make for an easy read. You feel like you know the town and the players within the legal community.
732	Sparks Sparks: In all their iterationsThrough seemingly endless musical stylesAnd a dozen band member versionsOver 30 odd years (and I do mean odd years)It still comes down to this record... Sparks Sparks.With songs like the brilliant "Fletcher Honorama" & "Fa La Fa Lee" and "High C" to define a sound for decades to come... if someone told me "you can only have one Sparks record" this would be the one and that includes Number one in Heaven - which is a must have brilliant record that every fan of pop music needs to own but Sparks Sparks is the stuff I always go back to. This is their only 5 star album and I say that very carefully as it will frustrate some die hard Sparks fans (but it's true) a huge percentage of their material is dreadfully flawed - however this album is perfect all the way through and stands alone in their discography as the oneJust my two cents...BTW: I've been listening to them since 1973 and have over the years owned just about everything they've ever released
733	GREAT WORKOUT!: I bought this dvd because I wanted to tone my bottom and burn fat. I've been doing it for about a month now, and I can see a difference. I have less cellulite! I'm truely happy with the results im having. The workouts really make you sweat and you feel the effects on your body. I highly recommend this dvd if you're committed to exercising & and want to get rid of cellulite. Just remember it takes time to see results!
734	Good Product: I had no problems. I was attracted to the great deal this prodct offered and thought I might have to sacrifice something in the process but I really didn't. It works great!
735	We use it daily: We purchased a Blendtec Blender in April. WE have used it for four months, and use it at least 3 times daily. In addition to smoothies and fruit drinks we use it to grate hard cheeses, make bread crumbs, construct dips, salad dressings and soup. Making Caesar salad dressing is drop dead simple with Blendtec. My only complaint is that a more comprehensive cook book should be included with the unit.It does things that no normal "blender" can do. I make a green smoothie for breakfast each morning and use purple cabbage as a primary ingredient.
736	Great Price! Great Product!: Mr. & Mrs. Claus had to assemble this on Christmas Eve. They had never seen this in-person, only in photos, so opening the box and seeing all the pieces made them gasp a bit. Fortunately, assembly took only 35 minutes and went very smoothly. There was one very happy 6-year-old at our house the next morning! Cottage has been played in almost daily and is quite a hit! She loves to use it as a "hideout", too. Holding up nicely at our house, but there is usually only one child playing in it most the time. We also love the "nesting" ability of the 2 pieces, which really helps with storage of the cottage.
737	Doesn't pressurize beyond 50 psi: I used it only once and returned it. As other reviewers have pointed out, it doesn't pressurize bike tires beyond 50 psi and the gauge shows wrong pressure. Also, the pedal bent only after 15 or 20 pushes. I do not recommend it.
738	Give me a break: This book only got 2 stars because of the fact I actually finished it, I don't usually finish books.This book is so annoying. No one with a real eating disorder is that happy about EVERYTHING, she happy about her parents, and some guy, and school, gymnastics and life...if you're so happy then why would you need an ED? Plus there is no way to get to 75lbs by just bulimia, maybe there is, but not the way she was going at it. There was no account of excessive excercise either. And getting so hungry she ate dog food???? Give me a break!It was an OK book until it got to her "recovery" she was just too happy about that too. Read Diary of an Anorexic girl, I mean most people will fight recovery. This book is just so pathetic, she sounds like a 12 year old girl not a college freshman. I in no way could relate to this girl and usually I can. Thank god the book was short other wise I would have completely wasted my time.
739	NOT a family movie: I was seriously disappointed ... and somewhat disturbed ... by this movie. The previews and descriptions make it out to be cute, funny, and romantic. It is NOT. It is one depressing or tragic situation after another for both human and dog in this story. It does not even seem to me to be a story about the dog as much as a story about a man who had to come to grips with the depressing reality that he will never fulfill his life's dreams. It might have been a good movie as a drama if it had been described as such. But since the expectations are set elsewhere it's hard to judge it according to its proper genre. And this is definitely NOT a kid's movie. Do not let young children watch this!
740	Just as Punishing & Unrealistic as Low Fat Diet: Like a lot of 30-something American males, I have 20 pounds to lose. Even though I work out five days a week, I still can't seem to take it off, mainly because I tend to overeat at meals and give in to junk food too often.I tried this diet and it didn't work for me...I made it five days. Mentally, I felt like a thick fog had come over me. I literally couldn't think or concentrate at all.At the gym, I had no energy to lift or run on the treadmill. I usually run three miles, but after five days on Atkins, I couldn't even make it a half-mile without exhaustion.So for me it's back to basics. Three reasonable-sized meals a day, counting calories and hitting the gym hard. And no snacks in between. Yes, it's painful, but not as painful as this diet, at least for me.And good luck to everyone in 2004 on their weight goals, no matter what method or diet you use!
741	Help to get Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand: Hello everybody,Iam a Nigerian need to get this Atlas Shrugged written by Ayn Rand but i have go to all the bookshop but I didn't find it. so with atmost good faith i plead to get this book.Even a used one or not. Pls anybody who can help me to get this book. I will be happy.
742	awesome reading: This is an excellent book. Very factual, but easy reading. On the edge of your seat kind of book.
743	Good sound... but finicky: I like how the foam plugs conform to your ear, but if you want them in tight - like for running - and you don't get them wedged in just right, the foam will squeeze shut and block the sound.
744	Never even received it!!!!! Pissed off!!!: I ordered this and waited and waited and never even received what I paid for I still want it or I want my damn mOney back!! I'm pissed to the extreme I hate when I pay my hard earned money and I get ripped off !! How f****in rude!!!!
745	Accurate restoration of God's name: Disregard the nay sayers who have rated this bible under 4 stars. They have no grasp of what an accurate translation is. This is the most accurate, easy to read bible you will ever see. It restores to the text the name of God in the seven some odd thousand times it appeared in the Old Testament (or Hebrew scriptures). This fact can be easily confirmed with the Strong's Concordance. It transliterates the word "Sheol" in place of the King James words, "Grave, Hell, and Pit". This lets the reader make up his or her own mind regarding the controversial subject of Hell, avoiding any outside, sectarian bias. It contains few distracting and unnecessary references which would serve only to keep the reader from learning God's word in a natural, undirected way, absent of religious influence. Buy it. I believe you'll be happy you did.
746	Perfect gift!: I bought this as a birthday present for my husband who loved it! He has a love for being outdoors and riding on his John Deere tractor. He also owns a truck to take hunting and/or collect firewood and couldn't wait to attach this to the front. He especially took liking to the diamond emobssed feature and said it's more manly (smile). Great product, guality was what I expected, and reasonable priced. Definitely served it's purpose in being a great gift for a guy.
747	It does NOT come with 120 foot hose-it has NO hose!!: Amazon needs to change the copy for this product. It does NOT come with the hose! Now I need to find a hose that will fit the sprayer. You can't use the foamer in a drain because it does not spray on its side and you can't stand it up and have the foam actually go into the drain. The product itself works just fine-it is that it is almost worthless without a hose!
748	Vapid Trail: I bought this new Rush CD shortly after it was released. I listened to it. I cried. I then went out to my backyard, dug a hole, and buried it.
749	Tony Hawk Rocks: My role model is Tony Hawk as soon as I saw the commercial for this I knew it was for me. I love it when he crashes you can get him back up. I went to my park to use it and an old lady complimented me on it to little kids went by and they liked it. If you have everything Tony Hawk then buy this. I also have THPS3,THPS2,and THPS1 and a lot of other Tony Hawk things I am even in his club at clubtonyhawk.com and I go to his games website planettonyhawk.com. So go out and buy this toy for your kid. If you need a battery pack and charger [a] local [store] probably might have one. Now That's All Folks.
750	Orginal and well woven: When they were doling out imagination, V. McIntyre stood in line twice. Her ability to draw the reader into the story so well, makes one feel as if one is co-conspirator with the protagonist. As to her originality, somehow she finds a way to the the everyday and make it both romantic and different. The tale flows in a upward spiral and succesfully builds to its very interesting conclusion. Except for the fact that the author's feministic imprint comes through too strongly in the novel, it would rate a 9. A must read for afficionados of SciFi and Fantasy who want something, well, original
751	Good tubing for liquid cooling systems: This tubing was very durable, flexible and easy to use. There was enough tubing to setup my liquid cooling system 3 or 4 times. I have plenty of extra. It serves it's purpose well and practically glows under my case lighting.
752	Interesting instruments, disappointing music: I had been drawn to this artist after hearing music of his backing a LVMH commercial played frequently on CNBC.Very beautiful, dense, atmospheric and melodic.This CD uses many guitar-like instruments that are unfamilar to my ears, which is interesting. However, I was expecting something very musical like the LVMH piece, but found more noodling than melody.Still, worth hearing for the instrumentation.
753	Love Brigadoon!: I got this version primarily because "Almost Like Being In Love" is one of my favorite songs. Now I do own the original broadway cast recording but thought it would be nice to get an updated version with a nice orchestra. I listened to the 1957 Studio cast recording with Jack Cassidy & Shirley Jones, the 1991 Broadway Angel version with Brent Barrett & Rebecca Luker and this one with George Dvorsky & Janis Kelly. Out of the these I liked George Dvorsky's voice the best so I went with this recording. Also, Megan Kelly's rendition of "The Love of My Life" is spectacular! The only downside is that Shirley Jones isn't on this one and she's my favorite Fiona. But in all, this is a fantastic recording!
754	file cabinet: This is a nice little cabinet and looks great for the price..real wood, not the simulated wood veneer pressboard you usually see. I really like how easily it went together and how nice it looks!
755	Long Advertisement: Looks like prior reviews were either friends or enemies of the author so I will give my objective point of view. I am not a nutrition expert, but do try to keep up on the latest nutrition news. there is some truth to each review; it is a quick read, it is dated, it is like cliff notes (not sure that's a good thing), but my problem with it is it seemed like I paid for a book that turned out to be a supplement the author is trying to push, there are much better nutrition books out there for the price with authors that seem to have the background required to give such advice.
756	Fun to read: Overall, it was a fun read. I couldn't put it down, I was amused with how Freedman and Barnouin described the evils of eating sugar, meat, and overprocessed foods. Although I do not agree with everything they write, it is worth reading. This book is a good resource for vegans primarily, but there's something in this book for anyone who wants to eat healthy and understand why certain types of food aren't healthy.
757	Drunkin karaoke anyone?: Holy crap, this guy SUCKS! All I want to know is how this dude pulls it off. I mean, he gets drunk out of his mind, babbles incomprehensible gibberish into the microphone, and PEOPLE PAY HIM TO LISTEN TO IT????!!!! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT???!!!! This guy is the biggest joke I have ever heard. "Yeeeeeer baaaaaawdy issssssaa wuuuuunerlaaaaaand............." PURE GARBAGE. Trust me folks, save your money. You need this album about as much as John needs another drink!!!!!
758	Highly recommend: Very good instructions included. Had no problem with initial use and refilling fuel. Excellent experience.
759	Junk: Received this knife set less than two weeks ago. The "Bonus Cheese Knife" which I was using for cheese, has already broken. The light-weight plastic handles are small, the knives are small. It's just a junky knife set. Not worth $20.
760	Good for Group Study: I give this four stars out of five because it assumes a lot of the fundamentals from, "Men Are from Mars, Women from Venus." Those fundamentals are referenced and discussed, but lacks a detailed explanation of "caves and waves" given in the intial ground breaking book.Nonetheless, the DVD is super. I am using it in a church setting discussing effective marital counseling. This DVD helps study and discussion of gender dynamics that are often misunderstood or that needlessly become the source of difficulty within marriage. In my own pastoral experience, too many counselors miss this important understanding of gender dynamics in marriage. My only concern is that I wish it would be stated that sometimes marital difficulties are a bit more complicated -- Familial background or just plain selfishness.
761	Reads more like a screenplay than a novel: Being a stranger to Jack Higgins, but being aware of his reputation, I was really looking forward to this book, but I was very disappointed indeed. Admittedly, I was not aware of the characters from the previous novels, but the characterisations were laughable and the action read more like a screenplay than a novel. The plot flowed swiftly, but not in a stylish way, more in a "Sean did this, Kate did that, so Sean did something else". It was more reminiscent of a high-school story than anything.If you want to read a good novel, with real suspense, that requires some emotional engagement, try some Ian McEwan.
762	Good: These replacement heads are as good as the one that came with the toothbrush. I would highly recommend this product.
763	Slapstick & boring: Too slapstick, silly & boring. I couldn't suffer through the first episode of this one.
764	psychedelic music at its best: If you have only heard of pink floyd, and don't have any of there albums, this is the one the one to start with. It sounds like it was recorded yesterday. If you are frustrated with today's "rock and Roll", then pick up this refreshing album. It's one where you can listen to it front and back all through. There is not one crappy song. Plus, now that it is on cd, you can listen to it in its entirety without having to flip it over to listen to side two. It's music people who do and don't use drugs can both appreciate.
765	So Far Great Product!: We've had this mattress pad now for 4 months. It's just as comfortable now as it was on day one. There was never any awful smell like prior memory foam products we'd ordered. It's not too hard or soft and doesn't take much time to mold to your shape. I would highly recommend one to anyone looking to make their existing mattress more comfy.
766	New breed of metal!: I think that Skinlab is one of best metal bands around today. I'm sick of everybody thinking that Korn and Limp Bizkit are metal cause they're not Skinlab is f'n awesome with their hard and heavy riffs and their hardcore lyrics makes this cd a one of the best in the metal industry.
767	great: Everything went smoothly. It arrived on time and was everything the description said it would be. I was very satisfied.
768	Oh, well...: This Cd is alright...okay, it's awesome somehow. There are many good tracks, many funny ones and many crap ones as well. I love "Under Your Spell" by Amber Benson (Tara), she's talented, if you don't wanna buy the CD, just check out her song because it's good. The lyric is nice and all, I can definitely feel love here in this song, the video clip is also cute. Anthony's songs are good too, check them out. Sarah Michelle ain't that good at singing but she managed, so are the rest of the team. Don't like James Marsters' voice.
769	Good at providing a single point of view: This is a good commentary for learning what very liberal bible scholars believe. It is, however, very bad for getting a balanced look at the moderate, conservative, and liberal academic positions.This is a very liberal publication. Don't count on the moderate and traditional views being portrayed accurately or in any good light (if they are portrayed at all).I think that many of the ideas advocated in the commentary are unsubstantiated and often remarkably far-fetched. Sometimes the positions offered have been shown to be false more than twenty-five years ago! This is why I give it a 1 out of 5.I recommend the purchase of the Navarre Bible (a commentary series). There you will find balanced, sensible, in-depth, and up-to-date commentary. It uses the more universally accepted RSVCE.
770	READ CAREFULLY These are I3 Diamonds!: I3 is a category of diamond that in the past would only have been used for industrial diamonds. (e.g. they would be ground up and used to make saw blades) However because of the demand for cheap diamonds, I3 diamonds are now being cut and used in jewelry. This is why the prices for certain types of diamond jewelry have become incredibly cheap.Diamonds are graded as follows: FL, IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1, I2, I3The grading description for I3 is as follows: "I3 diamonds have large and extremely easy to see inclusions that typically impact the brilliance of the diamond, as well as having inclusions that are often likely to threaten the structure of the diamond."I am all for look over perfection, but I would think twice before buying a diamond graded below SI2, unless this is for your young daughter who might lose them somewhere...
771	Cold Hit: Stick with Phillip Margolin and John Grisham. Very boring. You will get tired of reading about what liquor the main character drinks and how cultured she is....too boring to finish.
772	Seaman: Seaman is a very cool game. I was very excited when seaman talked back, but three days later I got bored. He don't really likes to talk he always talk about the old stuff over and over again VERY VERY bossy. I suggest you rent this game for few day, it's not worth to buy it.
773	Tastes Great. Mixes smoothly: My amazon shipment arrived recently and I am happy with the purchase. The vanilla ice-cream flavor tastes good and the powder mixes out very well. No lumps or cakes while drinking or in the bottom of glass. Cant speak to effect on my body yet as its early days still but happy with the buy. Beware though the 5lb bottle is humongous! It's 11 inches tall and 8 inches wide, takes up the space of a whole appliance on my counter! No regrets still.
774	Judge it by yourself.--I.M.Light: Guys, Those of you who condemn this book. I feel sorry for you. Can't you see the reality? Psycriatrics have proven time & again that it's all in your mind. C'Mon wake up. Your emotions govern the state of your health. I pray to God show them some light. You poor souls.
775	Good But...: In felt that this story was building up to a great big finally and boom there it was...the end and...I don't know... I felt let down. This was really a fast paced read up until the end and without giving up the ending I was left scratching my head as to how they figured it out and hello how they came about it. Still this was an okay read... certainly not one to rush out and buy brand new but one that is worth picking up second hand or from the library. Don't expect Lisa Gardner or Linda Howard but do keep an open mind.
776	Very disappointing although it started out very well: This book lost the plot half way through. The idea was excellent and the first half of the book was very good. It seems that Mr Koontz got bored with it halfway through and couldn't find an appropriate ending. THis could have been a great book like NIGHT CHILLS!
777	Pass on this one: I found this book hard to use to study for the Server+ exam. It was very hard to find out where the objectives map to the text by having to flip back and forth from the front of the book to the specific chapter!! It has it's share of typos and technical errors. Now I can see why this book is going for so cheap.
778	I Want to quit law school and join the Circus: This book makes me want to quit law school and join the circus. Well, not really but the book is that good. Written in a way that keeps you enthralled in the story. Loved it! And man does the character of August comes off sexy at times.
779	A Great Reference Guide: A Japanese proverb says, "If you wish to know the road, inquire of those who have traveled it." The authors of Tools and Tactics for the Master Trader clearly know the road. Their unique insights, trading tactics and powerful tools, so enjoyably presented, make this a book that belongs on every trader's shelf.Steve Nison, CMT - Author of Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques
780	The Army doesn't get it.: Having served in the Fourth Infantry Division in combat I feel that the Army started losing their rifleman skills a long time ago. Look to the Marine Corps if you want to learn to shoot. This has been true since Vietnam times.I qualified expert with the M14 yet I'm presently still learning from a Marine Corps Scout Sniper. You might try [...]
781	Finally, some Practical Advice!: This amazing book was full of practical advice and tips you can easily incorporate everyday. What separates this guide to success from other self help books is that Stop Whining and Start Winning is interactive. The quizzes and checklists helped me to identify my own weakness and understand what I need to do to help myself succeed.
782	An easy, informative read: This book is excellent. I had to read it as part of the teacher credential program. It is a really easy, plain English book. The content is excellent. It describes where we have been, where we are, and where we will be in terms of technology and how that will impact education. It is not about teaching technology to our students, but about changing the entire way we think about education and using technology to our best advantage. It is about our responsibility to our students to prepare them for the rapidly changing world in which we live. This book should be required reading for anyone interested in education.
783	cool, no-nonsense book on creating "wow" effects: While it is relatively easy to discover how to do most of the effects contained in this book (try searching the internet), this book provides the convenience of a concise, one-stop resource. The time and effort to collect the same number and quality of tips makes the book well worth its price. Take note that this book does not guide you through the basics of Photoshop; instead, it shows you step-by-step how to create cool effects without too much background information. This method is ideal for Photoshop beginners who just want to jump right in and start designing.
784	Haven't I read/seen/heard this before?: I don't mind books that operate on a similar theme as many others. When they are populated with utterly unlikable and unoriginal characters who flatly inhabit their deriverative universe, then a book slips off into the territory of the unreadable.
785	Your Back to the Screen Required!: I was disappointed with this Video compared to the others I have used. When trying to learn the "Boot Scootin Boogie" you have to turn your Back to the screen to try to get the perspective of the Instructor. Also the Video was shot in 1993 and maybe the technology didn't allow for proper lighting... it is very difficult to see with clarity the Dancers' feet except for the those who are wearing light colored boots. This Video would perhaps serve as a "refresher" for someone who had already learned the Dance and just wanted to refresh their memory. Even trying the rewind several times did not serve to clarify the initial step due to the Instructor's one dimensional example.Since a VHS tape allows for 120 minutes of instruction I would have liked this Video to have utilized more than 35 minutes to cram in 7 Dances.
786	Terrible way to end a carrer.: I totaly agree with the first review....that album realy sucks.I try to hear it many times,but its simply impossible.The Arrangements is so poor and out of date.Try any other Graces' album except that.
787	Broderbund behind in technology: I was hoping they had finally caught up with other home publishing and print programs but this is still really slow. I think Printmaster is and was better than Printshop.
788	Ingredients wrong??: The listing on Amazon stated:"Ingredients: Aloe Vera, vitamin E, Grape seed oil, Tea tree oil, Fragrance."However the bottle states:"Aloe Vera, MINERAL OIL, Extracted Plant Oils, Vit E, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance...Mica titanium..."I did not want to put vaseline and other petrochemicals on my face, so I requested a refund, but they charge 20% restocking plus postage...I think that the garbage is the best place for it.Lost about $5.
789	No better than the first: Much like Cunningham's first guide for the solitary Wiccan, this book was disappointing. There is very little of practical use, just a lot of hypothetical philosophy and a few contrived chants. Maybe that does it for some people, but for those who, there again, don't live in the middle of a secluded woods with unlimited access to natural items, the book offers nothing.
790	Fantastic Book!: CPORD - that how I define a lot of the challenges I face after reading this book, David Allen does a fantastic job of defining the problem and then coming up with a solution. CPORD means Collect/ Process/ Organize/ Review/ Do - this is the core of Allen's framework for work place productivity. I am so glad bought and read this book.
791	Shortened versions of too many hits. Why the rush Olivia?: If you're going to perform a song, perform the ENTIRE SONG. Don't leave out verses. Unfortunately, there's too much of this, especially during the country segment of the concert. Very disappointing.
792	A pleasant surprise: I had no idea Sean Connery was in this movie based on a great book by Michael Crichton. This film was fun, exciting, and very enjoyable and gave me a great understanding of the times and helped me with my understanding about the steampunk genre as well. Read the book, but enjoy the movie.
793	Bad !!!!: It is time for Adam to admit that it is over as this movie was really bad !!!! A serious waste of big names in a poorly written and acted movie.
794	A Confusing "Knock-Off": I liked the author's earlier "Lean Sig Sigma," developed for manufacturing applications. "Lean Six Sigma for Service," however, adds nothing for those seeking clearer guidance in improving service processes. For example, the material on Stanford Hospital very briefly covers an application, without detailing some of the essentials to getting key physician involvement and support; worse yet, the benefits and costs of the effort were not included. Thus, a reader would be unlikely to achieve substantive success. The material on Lockheed-Martin (18 computer systems to accomplish most everything) was interesting, but missed the "elephant in the room" - the prescribed "fast changeover" of screens simply covers up the enormous waste of 18 systems.
795	A must have for your collection: This movie is a fun and great family movie! This movie is a great start or addition to your DVD collection. Doris Day and James Gardner are fantastic in this timeless comedy. A must have.
796	Never Say Goodbye: Rock Hudson, Cornell Brocher & Shelly Fabra made this film about Rock Hudson was in the Service He was a Doctor, He marries Cornell Brocher & they have a daughter who grow up to be Shelly Fabrea. They have an argument an she leaves the apartment, he takes the child at age 2 and they become seperated until Shelly becomes he age of eight.. It is a beautiful story and needs to be brought back. I have a copy of it that I recorded off AMC but would like to have it in dvd.
797	Inspiring in a sneaky & humorous way: I'll be honest: I gave this book 5 stars not for its deathless prose or vast literary quality, but because it does exactly and charmingly what it sets out to do. Author Hurley shares many dozens of very short tales he wrote on the spot in only a minute for people who were waiting right in front of him. Talk about pressure! But Hurley proves that writer's block can be conquered, sometimes, by giving yourself a deadline. And he does a lovely job of capturing some essence, some droll humor, some cosmic message in each of these vignettes. I'd say he was able to force himself into a state of flow and let the words come without having the time to think about them too much. He seems to have a way of connecting with people quickly and he certainly has the ability of turning that connection into something quirky, fun, and surprisingly enjoyable to read. The next time you say you don't have time to write, you should be ashamed of yourself.
798	good products but what happened to Target?: I bought this and a couple of other things including the WII 20 pack.I had to return a broken charger within the 30 day warranty period. I mailed it USPO, without tracking it, to the return location provided on the warranty request sheet. That was month ago. It has not disapppeared but there is no RSVP from Target. Simple request for a warranty repair.No response from Target. Unfortunately mail order at Target for WII warranties was not responsive. Perhaps a bad rap on the part of their Mail order department will get me an answer---PDQ. If not, I am unable to see why anyone would want to order from them. Target on line and mail order process.
799	Nice set...would buy another: Corelle Callaway dinnerware set is awasome.....I bought this set for $12.98, really it is looking great with matching lids and with the price.....I would buy another if i get an offer.shipping was good without any damage.
800	A Dissapointment: for anyone looking for another "Girl With a Pearl Earing", do not expect anything similar in this book. Being a very dedicated Vermeer fan, i was excited to learn of this book but was dissapointed by it. while parts were interesting, the majority of the book was dull and the plot moved along slowly. i never even began to sympathize with the main character, patricia dolan, and i felt that the attempt made by the author to make the character more sympathetic was sappy and uninteresting. the only reason that i gave it two stars instead of one is a small plot twist at the end that i thought was slightly clever.
801	I Have not used it --it is a gift: This is a Christmas gift so we have not yet tested it nor even opened the box. It arrived on time.
802	Disappointed: I ordered the Minolta 80 Zoom camera and it was shipped to me and was OK. I then ordered one for a friend, however, it did not work. I returned it to the vendor who sent me another camera. This second one did not work. I returned it, indicating I did not want another one, that I wanted a refund. I did not get the refund from the vendor, so I called Amazon, who processed the credit for the return. The first camera I purchased did not take good pictures. I was very disappointed with the quality of the camera.
803	Highly Disappointing: No power. Doesn't pick up cat litter. Can only use it for 5 minutes at a stretch. I'm really regretting purchasing this.
804	Love The Software - HATE THE COMPANY: Quickbooks software is great - I really do love it, but if you need ANY TYPE OF HELP...forget it. Intuit, Quickbooks Publisher, is as custom UNFRIENDLY as companies get.I have used quickbooks for years including several upgrades and additional services. I had a computer crash and lost the software - and everything else. I have the disks but since they are upgrade CD not the "full program" I can't reload the software onto my new system.Help from Quickbooks? Not unless I am willing to pay $50-$149 the cost of buying the brand new software which I shouldn't have to do.Quickbooks offers the worst customer service of any company I have ever done business with so if all you want is great software, then Quickbooks is for you. If you MAY EVER need any type of support, avoid all Intuit products; Quicken, Quickbooks, TurboTax and more.Chad Currin
805	The Bizkit is Limp: Oh dear. I liked Rollin' when I first heard it (when it was used for the Undertaker's {WWE Wrestler} tune), and so I tried to find the single. I couldn't find it so I bought the album. There were some good songs, but after a couple of months, it becomes repetitive like disco music (God, I HATE disco!).... At least no more albums after New Old Songs will come out.
806	Fabulous: This is fab the girls a great.In there other CD's They sound like babies But in this one they sound like real pre teens.
807	I Spy a lot of fun: This is a great album to enjoy with a younger child (or two.) None of the objects are too difficult to find, but sometimes you've got to keep looking. And occasionally you've got to think outside the box.Enjoyable, and fun 'family time'.
808	Junk: Another poor performer from our friends (?) at HP. This annoying little beauty worked ok for about two months, but now freezes up every time I try to burn a CD. Re-installing software doesn't help, nor does talking to HP (and they charge for customer support calls!). Avoid this junk.
809	Can easily buy for extra remote: Game is worth no more than $10. But as it comes with extra remote, the price is worthy. It also helps to have a few small games in the collection.
810	What a crock of s***: Waste of time and money. This movie was made for brain dead idiots. Corny and predictable. What a shame so much talent and funds were spent on such crap.
811	Fan Fiction with Anne Shirley: First I have to say that I am an Anne of Green Gables book fan. I've read all the books several times. We all know that movies WILL BE different from the book upon which it is based. But this movie is a version of fan fiction. Kevin Sullivan took the AoGG characters and wrote a whole different story from anything L M Montgomery has ever written!! There is no resemblance between this series (movie) and the sweet flavor of the first two AoGG series (movies) he produced. If you are not a book fan you may enjoy this movie... if not, don't waste your money and read the books again instead.
812	TOTAL WASTE: No value here, waste of a lot of $. There are good books out there on selling, this is not one of them. All hype, all slick and no substance. The author is trying to sell himself, not offer wisdom. The co-author is his wife who has no education or expertise. A rip-off.
813	A great sping-form pan: Not too much you can say about a baking pan. This seems to be quality construction from Germany. It was a little pricey but seems to be worth the money. Baked with it and there were absolutely NO leaks, which is how this pan should perform. Serious bakers will like it.
814	Cute but not quality.: We had this for about a year when all of the chairs started to fall apart. I've had to tighten the hardware on the table several times.
815	Needs warning label, "Fullscreen only"! Very Disappointing!!: Why fullscreen only? Any why does it not clearly statethis on the package?!! This is a major disappointment that I retruned becuase it was not widescreen. Why no widescreen version (i.e. the theatrical version kept whole)? That's what the movie is supposed to look like. Why supply only the chopped-at-the-sides fullscreen version. Very, very disappointing! Dreamworks release this set in widescreen and I'll buy it!
816	Bulb Burnt Out When First Turned On: The title of this review says it all. The moment I turned it on, the filament in the bulb blew. On a positive note, mine doesn't seem to be cloudy like many other people are experiencing, but I'd just like to actually USE the lamp. I can tell already customer service through their 800 number is going to be a dead end...It's been a day since I left a message and no call back yet. Also their "infomaster@lavalite.com" e-mail address get's returned. It's really too bad that such a classic product seems to be in the hands of incompetence. One look at the "official" Lava Lite site and it's pretty obvious whoever is in charge doesn't seem to care...it's a mess, and looks likes it was put together by the current owners 12 YO son.
817	One of the worst books I have ever read: This book is crazy. There is way too much usage of the "F" word; which if appropriate in establishing something w/in the book, I am fine with, but there did not seem to be a good reason for the constant profanity. The author is constantly berating the reader and anyone else he can think of. While reading the book, I felt angry. If there was something in the book of merit to make me feel anger, I would not have a problem with that.There does not seem to be a plot and it is very hard to follow where it may be heading. The previous commentary was very diplomatic about the first half of the book. I on the other hand suggest this book be avoided.This is my first and last Nick Tosches book.
818	Wrong Battery!!!!!: This is NOT the correct battery for the devices they list. And, they don't carry the correct one! So, now I have to return this one and can only hope that they refund my shipping, too!
819	Good show but horror price..: i like this show even though i have no chance to watch entire series, but few episodes are enough for me to dig in.. However, the price just enough to keep people away.. even with the most popular show on air now also no price this high.. i am very disappointed that i must hold off my hand on this series until reasonable price been reach.. too bad for a good show that cannot reach every people due to the price.. shame.. shame..
820	The movie it ain't!: I purchased this SACD after reading the glowing reviews and was disappointed when I listened to the recording. Despite being the soundtrack to a VERY LONG film, there was very little contrast in the 18 offerings on the disc. Unlike numerous classical SACDs that have greatly moved me, "Dances With Wolves" merely lulled me to sleep.
821	The Year of Fog: While the book had some very intriguing parts that kept me going, mostly it was very slow. Not one I would read twice.
822	Not needed: After purchasing along with the ultrasonic cleanerand paying almost the same amount for the shippingas the solution, I was advised bythe manufacturer that this itemwas no needed to use with the cleaner.
823	Ultimate Grill Cover: This thing is extremely well built. Is very sturdy yet flexible and I believe will last a very long time. It has a couple of features that I personally didn't thing was needed for a grill cover but it is kinda nice to have. And that is the little pockets if you want to store a few things and a couple of vents that allows it to breath even though some moisture can get thru on your grill. But that's not a major problem because from my experience, you need a like a driving rain with winds blowing at your grill for that to happen. So, this cover is the only cvover worth buying and using in my opinion if you can find one like I did on Amazon.com with some amazing prices. Because other than that these can be kind spendy. But I see why. They are probably the best grill cover out there.
824	not that great...: The Product got here in good time. But the box was slightly coming apart and the third disc is so scratched i need to get it re-serviced because it wont play through.
825	Possessed...!: DarkVisions is an amazing trilogy full of all issues that surrounds teenagers today. Dealing with relationships, trouble, friends and love! Kaitlyn's life is very facinating in The Possessed and The Passion tells us how her life ends up. Will she end up with Rob or Gaberiel? Will thier telepathy link be broken? And will they fight and survive the battle against Zetes? Read The Passion to find out !
826	Starting off on the right foot: This is Billy's first solo effort, although most would agree a lot of what everybody liked about Ultravox was also Billy's solo effort. Currie seems to take a bit of departure on this CD...the songs have a little more "funk" in them if you will and no vocals. Airlift and Transportation are the obvious picks, but Traveler is a great song, and Rakaia River is simply incredible. India is one of those classic building songs that rewards you in the end.
827	If I get eaten by a worm, I won't have to watch this . . .: There are different ways to approach a subject as complex as Dune:You can either take the time to tell the story properly, which requires either a mini-series or a series of movies (a la Lord of the Rings). You can also boil the story down to the bare minimum and tell a very basic story, or you can do what they attempted to do here, which was to take the entire story and compress it into two hours.The end result, of course is similar to flying over Disneyland. Sure, you get an idea of what's going on, but you miss actually experiencing it.Dune is like that. Huge chunks of narrative exposition and brief, shallow storytelling that doesn't have the time to explore anything in depth.Save yourself. Read the books.
828	The Best of Nightline: John Belushi's Career: If you want a John Belushi video, don't buy this video. It does have about 5 to 10 minutes on john's career but the rest of the tape is the news for that week in March 1982 and doesn't involve Belushi at all. If you want Belushi, get Animal House or the Blues Brothers.
829	Don't buy it.: I bought it for $19.99 and it is a dog... battery management requires only charging for 8 hours and constantly having the battery in the charger and charging too long... or it's in the device and dead... designer expects you to vacuum for 15 minutes every 8 hours !!! Dust collector is too small for normal use... changing pads is weird... have to take off pad to recharge the battery. Nice idea... very flawed design.
830	Sucks!: All these movies build up and the ending just cuts off! Worst money ive spent on movies! It builds up to nothing!
831	THE BEST OTC CLEANER: I FOUND THIS IN PUBLIX ON THE DISCOUNT TABLE AND BOUGHT 2 BOTTLES. IT IS THE BEST OTC CLEANER I HAVE EVER USED!! UNFORTUNATLY I CAN'T FIND IT ANY MORE AND AM HOARDING THE SMALL AMT I HAVE LEFT. I COULD USE THIS ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE ]BATH ROOM AND KITCHEN] ESPECIALLY DURING THIS LAST FLU SEASON AND FEEL SECURE ANDUT KILLING ANY TYPE OF GERM!! SURE WISH I COULD FIND APLACE THAT SELLS IT---THIS TIME I'D STOCKUP!
832	Cermaic Onion Soup Crocks: Broken pieces: Speedy delivery, but no good: One of the crocks arrived already broken. Protective packaging is still minimal, so no wonder. Just cannot recommend ordering them...
833	Long. Boring.: Perhaps it's my lack of enthusiam for classic English literature, but I found this book dull and very unamusing. I purchased this because my English teacher wanted us to read it, and while I don't regret buying it, I highly doubt I'm going to read it again.Though, keep in mind I'm but a teenager, and not a fan of the classics. I'm sure if the classics are your thing, then you'll love this book. The included appendix and notes help out a lot.
834	I finally found this size!: We've been using Trico winter wiper blades for years, but could not find this size in our local stores. Thank you Amazon for having it!
835	Horrid movie: One of the worst films I have ever seen even my five year old sister hated it. Do not buy!
836	not as good as expected.: This is my first cb cd, the only other thing i've heard is "Block rocking beats" and that's the the sound i expected. The mixing is ok and there is a few good beats but that's it. Overall it's somewhat boring.
837	FORTUNATELY, I CAN HEAR!!: That is why I gave Josh Groban's "Live at the Greek" ONE star and so have many many more reviewers here. It doesn't deserve more than this. The overwhelming number of reviews are from people who can HEAR pretty darned good and have bought this terrible DVD set, to major disappointment. We can HEAR every NASAL note that Groban belts out. I'm not alone but apparently some people are in limbo because all the insults in the world can't make people go deaf to the problems Groban is having. I'M HAPPY I GOT MY REFUND. THIS DVD SET IS HARDLY DESERVING OF ONE STAR.
838	Great Book!: This book was a really good read, and helped me out greatly with my political science course. Highly recommended!
839	Who In Hell is Wanda Fuca? (A Leo Waterman Mystery: This book was great, I read it in two days and it kept me interested from start to finish. Many fun surprises in the plot.
840	Would agree with the Nayes!~: Quickbook supports lacks for an average user. We have been using Quickbooks since 1997 and have stopped at 2001. This is due to, among other things...charges for a software problem... charges and long-waits, and more charges. Anyway, if you know accounting, such as an advisor, sure one would use Quickbooks, but ever since these products became some how intertwined with Microsoft, the service and quality have not been the same... Also, don't try to export data, this function is very poor! Can anyone recommend another product. WE are a growing company and do not want to deal with Intuit's surprises with the tax tables. What has gotten into them? Is this maybe the greed state of a small monopoly on accounting programs? Go figure!
841	Skip It unless you REALLY, REALLY want the song Higher Power: Higher Power is a pretty cool song that doesn't a whole helluva like the Boston we all knew and grew up with, but if you want it very badly then that is the only reason to buy this disc. Otherwise, just buy the debut and Third Stage and if you have nothing better to do with you money buy Don't Look Back as well.
842	"Detective" an unbelievable and uneven read: This is the only Arthur Hailey novel I've read and it didn't live up to his reputation as a great novelist. Initially I was intrigued by the theme of the novel, however, as I read the book two things put me off. First, the characters are just not believable, and second, he kept going back and forth in time as he told the story. I found the latter especially annoying as I tryed to understand why he chose this approach to write this book. I did finish the book, but I've read better.
843	Seems like a recipe for disaster: This book describes a training regimen for children that is identical to that used by the unenlightened to create dogs vicious and aggressive enough to participate in dogfights.Infants and young children are not adults - they don't reason, they just react. Instead of getting this book, you'd be better off buying a modern dog-training book that emphasizes teaching your dog to enjoy cooperating and being with you. You'll get more useful information about being a good parent than you'll find in this whole book.
844	Nikita: This is one of the best shows i've seen in years. After the first episode i was hooked and with each new episode is a new adventure and a new twist. I strongly recommend that everyone give this series a shot. You wont be disappointed.
845	a major disappointment: Not having read Stine's teen books, I was looking forward to this book as a good read for Halloween. It wasn't. The plotting and writing were like a first draft. A lot of it didn't make sense. I gave it one star only because the sex scenes were (unintentionally) very funny.
846	Perfect DVD: Laura is one of my favorite movies. I was not dissappointed. The DVD is perfect. The condition is perfect. It is in the original black and white just as it should be. It is a full screen edition which I was grateful for. There are also special features like an excellent biography of Gene Tierney with interviews with her sister, Pat, her daughter, Tina, and even Oleg Cassini. Also her double. Many clips from her various films. There is also a biography of Vincent Price. There are commentaries, deleted scene and movie trailer. For anyone who admired the work of Gene Tierney and loved the movie, Laura, this is a must have. I am very happy that I got it!
847	Reservation's Blues: Alexie's ability to paint the characters in his work is only surpassed by the caliber of their authenticity. Sherman is not a Native American William Faulkner as other authors of the genre (like N. Scott Momaday) and in Reservation Blues, that serves him well.
848	At last I found you....: I am so happy to find these Altoids; they are my favorites! I thought that they weren't being made anymore. You have a customer for life!
849	Good golf book for women: This was a very easy book to read and understand. I really wish I had read it when I first started playing a couple of years ago. Any time I can learn something, I consider it a plus and this was definitely a "Plus" book.
850	Awesomeness: My son wears a size 17 shoes. The fact that Ugg even makes a size 17 is awesome. When my son put these shoes on, he understood what all the fuss has been about for years with the girls. His toes had never been happier, squishier, or roomier.
851	Don't waste your time.: Disjointed, utterly predictable plot, and poor character development. Obviously, Patterson phoned this one in just for the bucks.
852	save ur money.nothing special.: maybe 2 songs were good......... the rest nothing special. save ur money
853	Skip it: I would say if you are new to the band you might find this appealing. For me it was not the same as past musical experiences I had in listening to albums of the past, including several that came after the famous "Licensed to Ill" which I have heard is one of Capitol Records all-time best selling albums. This CD left me frustrated as I did not feel there was very much creativity at all. As they say; "to each his own" but I personally felt this CD was a letdown.
854	Not Very Durable: These brushes were a disappointment and are not very durable. The adhesive which holds the brush together came apart the first time we used them so the handle is not secure. The bristles are not very soft, and tend to fall out easily. If you are planning on using your brushes often, you may want to consider a different set.
855	Lonely Planet Tonga: This was a very interesting guidebook. I found it to be very helpful in all aspects. It was very easy to read. I especially liked the boxed sections on various nuances of the country and culture. The language section was also very helpful. Great Guide.
856	Best flash I've ever owned!: Using the SB-800 was beyond my expectations. It does everything and more. The bounce features are especially nice and produce professional results everytime. Using the remote wireless flash using my D70 was so easy that I think even a child could use it. Have owned it for over a month and have never experienced any problems. Great, quality product as all Nikon products are.
857	Poor sound quality for a Blu-ray: Cool movie, and the picture is great, but the sound could be a lot better. You will have to turn it up ALL the way in order to understand the dialog. Expected better sound quality from a Blu-ray.
858	Way too big!!: I tried on the exact same pair that a co-worker has, and they fit great. I decide to order my own pair, paid $85.00 for them, and they slipped off my face every time I looked down. Not sure what the problem was, but they are currently en-route back to Amazon!!!
859	Pathetic: An operetta is a musical production in which the songs are crucially important. If the sound is so poor that you hardly hear the singer, how can you possibly enjoy this? A typical Morbisch prodution has pathetic sound, and this Merry Widow is no exception. It is filmed on an outdoor stage with tiny microphones on each performer and it does not work. Act III at Maxim's does not feel Parisian at all. Choreography is poor or non-existent, dances do not flow. This Maxim's feels like an amateur 3-ring circus. There is no feeling between the performers and they are supposed to be in love! This version has tried to add some humor to the dialogue and it fails miserably. This is the very worst performance I have seen of the Merry Widow, either on stage in Europe or on tape. I own an old VHS tape of a Sydney Opera House performance, with Joan Sutherland as Anna, wow!
860	Awesome in its simplicity and great songs: I bought this DVD after I realized it was Chris Rice singing "When Did You Fall in Love" on the radio. Well I fell in love with every song on this DVD. You feel like you've been invited over to a private concert at Chis Rice's house. (It was filmed in his backyard and living room.) Now I have purchased two of his CD's "Amusing" and "What a Heart is Beating For" So glad I discovered this artist. His clear, smooth voice with great melodics and clever, heart touching lyrics....well need I say more!?
861	Best dental floss: This flat, waxed floss slips easily between tightely spaced teeth and into the peridontal region between gum and tooth to scrap the tooth surface below the gum line where peridontal disease develops. Proper use of this floss disrupts pockets forming below the gum line, which helps recovery and prevents complications due to deepening pockets and peridontal disease. Flossing can be followed by an effective mouth wash lavage using Waterpik or similar device.
862	I Like It!: As a novice to the world of DVD, I was searching for something, checked BestBuy, KMart, Wal-Mart, wanted to take a "test drive" of the DVD movie THE HIRE by BMW. No luck, most places either had nothing I was interested in or they were far too expensive or not interested in assisting me.The price was right, and I especially enjoy both the FM and AM radio reception.The remote control does have too many and too small buttons, has been difficult for me to figure out, but when I do it right everything is great. I still keep the users' manual close by.Getting up to change disks from one to another is a pain sometimes, but I need more exercise.I cannot imagine how that new system Bose is flashing on my screen can be worth over ten times what I paid for the Koss.
863	Useless after short period: This unit could not be reset after a couple of walks rendering it useless.
864	People believe this?: The minute I hit the part about the priest in Paris, I knew something smelled funny. Well, it was a tossup between that and the conveniant suicide of Lilly, just a few hours before Frey's release. If it were just the one incident, he'd get away with it, but taken all together the book gives off the odor of trying too hard. It all reads like your basic movie-of-the-week, except with more vomit.
865	poor opera: This is one very bad Werther, principally because Werther is sang in a very bad Way by this singer that is a marketing success. I think that this record would be "perfect" with Sarah Brightmann singing Charlotte and maybe the orchestra conducted by Andre Rieu.
866	A big fat book , but you can't find the information: If one has a problem, the solution can't be easily found in the book. For example, do you wan't to learn about "Safe Mode", not in the index. Windows 98 has program "System Tools" , can't find it, nor can you find "Maintenance" . I really haven't been able to find much of help in the index ...although the information must be buried somewhere in a book as large as this one .
867	Not the greatest war memoir: This book was published in German in 1988 and tells of the author getting into the German military at age 18 (he was born in 1920). He became a paratrooper but only seems to have actually jumped in Holland and in Crete. He was also in Poland, Norway, Russia, Sicily, Italy, and France (at the time of the 1944 invasion).. He surendered in Germany in March of 1945 and spent a year in England as a POW (which sounded like the best of the time he had from 1938 to 1946). Much of the book is a recitation of not too interesting events in Sicily, Italy and France. There are many photos reproduced very poorly in the book and the few maps are singularily unhelpful. The evoluition of the author's thinking in regard to Hitler I found of interest--he says the women of Germany were more perceptive in regard to Naziism than the brain-washed men.
868	Oldplay...or perhaps x & ZZZZZ.: This is cynical 'bored' room music meant to secure high earnings. Martin's half yawn, half yodel vocal style oozes a saccharine sweet sentimentality that many are sure to confuse as passion. Singer Chris Martin is beligerent to suggest that 'X&Y;' is the album that will 'take out U2'. What a slap in the face to their idols.X&Y; finds coldplay teetering between a paint by numbers U2 style and 1980's Ah-ha. It could also be called, clocks the remix album, as every song sounds the same. The music is ethereal, yet lugubrious and flacid. The coldplay formula is simple and by now overexposed.There is no real growth here. Perhaps coldplay have a future mining the past, but the new music shows no growth, or willingness to create.U2... even Ah-ha need not worry, at least musically. Yodel-ay-he-hoo!!!!
869	Disappointed: I, unlike most readers of this book, I suppose, did not read the prequel, Vurt. I was suckered in by the comparisons to Gibson. I must confess I was sorely disappointed. There were interesting characters, and a fairly interesting plot, but as a whole the book just shouted, look at this cool idea I have for a story, see, SEE. The writing certainly was not as tight as Gibson's, and I really had trouble caring what happened to the characters. Oh well.
870	Five stars for the pics, -3 for the writing: 'Relieved to see the Traverse City reader's comments. I thought I was alone in failing to see the supposed "magic" of the book's verse. And is it legal to claim a byline for a Native legend that's as old as the hills? Just wondering.
871	suhdididly-uck: wow this movie blowsssssssssssss with the fire of 1000 suns. how on earth did he piece the retainer and the tooth to meaning that the family was dead? i mean if i find a hotpocket and a sock on the porch does that mean my brother's dead?!! i seriously thought that it was going to be great by looking at the commercials. dont dont waist your money renting this flaming piece of crap.
872	Avery 3 x 5 Inch Index Cards (5388): My wife was handwriting note cards for a class she is taking and the process of doing this by hand is not only time consuming but finding a pen that would be easy to read but not bleed through the thin note cards available today was proving to be a task in itself. Having used Avery brand labels in the past we decided to check out what was available and found not only these cards but also free MS Word templates available at the Avery Web site. Not only do the 5388 Avery Index cards make the process of producing note/flash cards easy the MS Word templates allow you to save soft copies of your cards which is excellent.These cards have been so helpful we are ordering more today!!
873	Great title, but missed the mark: This book holds great promise in the title, however the author fails in two major areas. First, as he explains his therapeutic approach he makes reference to feeling magnetic fields from the subject's body. I highly doubt that this is possible for any human, but even if he is able to do this it is not reasonable to assume that this skill can be transferred. Second, he repeatedly recommends feeling the underlying tissues and bringing them into alignment. While this seems more plausible than feeling magnetic fields, it remains highly doubtful that anyone not doing this on a daily basis will ever develop the skill to feel tissue below several layers of skin, fat, and other connective tissue.My final complaint is that the writing style hangs heavily on technical jargon and repeatedly makes reference to techniques to be explained on other pages, which of course, never are satisfactorily addressed. And then there is the repulsive repetition...Just don't buy the book.
874	PhD required: I purchased this product from Amazon, and have now had it 7 hours. I have been reading the directions for setting the time almost that long, and still the unit will not set the time of day. My brilliant husband has tried, my brilliant step-son, and brilliant me. I've written a letter to the company. Their web site only provides the same elusive instructions as are on the package. This is not an easy gizmo to work. I haven't given up yet, but I am totally vexed and feel cheated.Signed,Vexed in Vermont
875	This book was a TOTAL WAIST of time.: I was very excited to get this book, but, upon it's completion, wished I'd saved my money. While it's authors "grab" your attention in the beginning by alluding that there was an actual conspiracy theory, in the end, they conclude it was nothing more than an accident. Why did they continually present "compelling" evidence that her death was an actual conspiracy/cover up all through out this long drawn out book only to conclude in the end that it actually wasn't? Well, I suspect it's because they wanted us to finish reading it. In my opinion, they state MANY good reasons why it most probably WAS a conspiracy, but, again, in the end, they conclude it wasn't. I felt cheated.
876	Band of Brothers: I have not had the oppertunity to see this set of DVD'S. I bought it as a gift for my son. However, he considers it a wonderful gift and has greatly enjoyed watching. He said it deserves an excellent grade
877	Omnisky Defines Wireless Connectivity: This product is a great leap forward into the next realm of wireless connectivity. If you are considering on buying the Palm VII, don't. The Omnisky unit give you a lot more content to make you web browsing more enriched. It's speeds are definitely more reliable than than a standard at home 56K modem speed. If you're and avid user of eBay, are constantly guarding your stocks, or just don't have time to check you e-mail at your office then this product is perfect. The only drawback is that you will only get a strong connection areas surrounding major cities since the company is still in its initial stages. You will not be let down if you purchase this.
878	excellent quality: The extension wand is made of high quality metal that will withstand much abuse. It worked very well when used and was reasonably light weight and controllable for its length. I would recommend this to anyone!
879	Whats with the price?: Giving this a 1 just because the price makes this a terrible value. I got the regular dvd of this for $10, is the extra resolution worth this much more?
880	Better than expected: I was unsure whether or not I would like this movie, it looked really good but maybe too mean spirited, in the end I really enjoyed it! Great movie real characters all had their strengths and weaknesses. Worth buying.
881	Enthralling.........: Helprins' prose is indelibly melodic in "Winter's Tale" and this book will enchant and intrigue the reader. This isn't a book that can be read and easily reviewed, but one that must simply be experienced. Helprin has created a remarkable character, Peter Lake, aded a city, New York, and entwined them in a timeless fantasy of love and justice, tragedy and remorse, valor and determination. This book is a paean to the human heart.Let me add that any reader who judges a novel by the politics of its' author is no bibliophile, but a captive to their intellectual limitations. Politically left, right or middle, any lover of books, as any lover of words, will delight in Winter's Tale.
882	Great idea, horrible phone.: Both batteries died within a year of minimal use. Backup battery seemed like a good idea, but what good is 2 dead batteries??
883	Exact replacement of original: This is an exact replacement of the factory charger. The price is great. The charger does all it is supposed to do and does it even faster than is claimed. Good unit.
884	Not "real" Wii straps: I ordered these straps to actually put on my camera. I drop my camera a lot, and love being able to tighten these down to your wrist. Well these straps I ordered are just cheap knock offs. The little sliding part does not lock down like the real Wii straps do. It just slides back and forth, so was useless.
885	ENYA: I bought this album not long after it came out in 2000 and I listen to it all the time, its soothing and very melodic. Enyas voice is without a doubt one of the most soothing voices ever! this CD is perfect for sitting down and relaxing too... i used to listen to it when i would go tanning, thats how relaxing this CD is.I recommend it for anyone who likes instrumental melodic hymn like songs.....recommend "a day without rain, only time, fallen embers, floras secret and the radio played wildchild"
886	False advertising: This product did not have additional language options as expressed by the product detail. It's for this reason exactly that I seldom purchase from independent sellers
887	The 1900 House: Even though this documentary was made over 11 years ago, (I saw it when it on PBS when it first came out), I still enjoyed it. I bought this video to share with friends for it's entertainment value as well it's historical and informational value. A great social experiment filmed in the documentary style.
888	False advertising: this is NOT ultra slim: This portable DVD player is about 1.5" in height, which in my book is not "ultra slim." Take a look at Sony's VAIO T series laptops; they are less than an inch at the thickest point, now *that* is ultra slim. This Audiovox is thick and bulky, and the 7" screen looks awefully small even in a car.
889	An okay read.: To be completely frank. I expected so much from this book only to be disappointed. I expected a book with more depth and a better plot. Okay, so there wasn't much of a plot. I've read other books that were equally plotless but this one I didn't like much at all. It lacked everything I wanted in a contemporary, young adult book. And seriously. I just feel bad about it. After the 100th page I started feeling like the story, or an inkling of it was going down hill from there.This book is pretty much written for way younger readers below 14 years of age. And I'm hoping whoever read this below that age group were able to understand whatever morale Dessen has written it to give out.That Summer is Sarah Dessen's debut novel and I'm pretty sure she has gotten better over the years. Since everyone loves her books. I'm going to go ahead and pick up her latest book and have at it. In hopes that her books have more depth and a lot more fluff!
890	Many typos: There is at least one typo in every chapter and some chapters have multiple mistakes. The chapter on logarithms even has an example that they forgot to include the answer to and there was a mistake in the chapter on conic sections that made me think I was going crazy. Normally I'd be a little forgiving but COME ON. This is math. Having mistakes in a math book can really mess with people's heads.
891	Great Cologne, Great Price!!!!: Curve Crush is a great scent and the price on Amazon.com is MUCH LOWER than a department store.
892	NOT FOR WINDOWS XP: CAN'T INSTALL OR PLAY ON WINDOWS XP. I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING THIS CHILDHOOD GAME WITH MY SON.
893	Blues Agressivo: As a Brazilian lad studying in Boston back in 1998, I was more than addicted on rock radios and tried to get to know as many new bands as possible. MTV was as waste of time so I used to watch MUCH MUSIC, sort of a Canadian version of that ill fated American "music channel". That's where I first saw BIG SUGAR and they totally blew me away.Next day I was going through the dozens of used cd stores in town looking for their material. "Five Hundred Pounds" was the only album I found and it's probably their best. It's blues, but it's not. It's classic rock, but it's not. It's alternative, but it's not. It just sounds irresistibly GOOD! The riffs are craunchy and the band carries a groove that 90% of the hyped bands nowadays would give their left arm to be able to create and keep.How come they never got big? Bad management, perhaps. Quality they sure got.
894	Poor description: The product description was not detailed enough so i inadvertently ordered the wrong product. Later, when i tried to email the seller to return the items for another one, i received no response.
895	Cheap and surprisingly good: I waited a month after I got them to write a review, because I was a tad skeptical of the durability of the product due to its price. They work great on the go with more than acceptable sound quality. PRICE PRICE PRICE!!!
896	Cheap and not worth the price: Ten stitches into installation and the needle broke. I gave up and threw it away when it was clear that it was way too big for my 14 1/4 inch steering wheel. I gambled on this one versus one costing three times as much. I lost.
897	IM LOVIN IT!: CASH KOLA IS ON A ROLE. WHOEVA DONT KNOW ABOUT HIM, I FEEL BAD FOR YOU, YOUR MISSIN OUT ON A LOT. HE IS A VERY GOOD RAPPER THAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT! IM LOVIN EVERY SONG ON HIS CD. LIFE IN GENERAL. OH AND HE GOT 112 ON THERE, WHICH IS A PLUS! I CANT WAIT TIL HE MAKES A VIDEO, HOPEFULLY HE WILL, CUZ ONE DAY HES GONNA BECOME REALLY BIG, I JUS KNOW IT. YOU KNOW HOW WE DO IN THE D! =]
898	A MUST READ BOOK! OUTSTANDING!: Football legend Frosty Westering's revolutionary vision is laid out in an easy-to-read and very interesting little book. If only I had read this book years ago.... I have already loaned it to two other people and they have conveyed to me how fantastic it really is.
899	None: This is the book that turned me into a Karin Slaughter fan. I found her book randomly in the house we moved into and hooked me. Its graphic but at the same time warm hearted and suspencable. Sarah is a busy Doctor and ME who lived in a small town. Once you read the first chapter you cannot stop.
900	Absolutely terrible: This book is terrible - it seems to be more of a commentary on the polish language, rather than an guide to learn it. Grammatical rules are half explained, at best, and vocabulary lessons are thin, to say the least. I am using it right now for college level class and it's the best paperweight I've ever had. Our teacher gives us pages of notes to support what the book barely glosses over. If you want to learn to speak polish, look elsewhere.
901	Misses the mark: This was very disappointing. I bought this and his newsletter which lost lots of money. I wish I had stuck with other option experts than try this unknown Mr. Trester. Lives up at Tahoe financing a life style from selling his opinion.The book is just a retelling of the simple option strategies that other authors have adequately covered. No vision and no new angle.I have bought other books that were easy to understand and got to the point. I used the Amazon Top 10 option bestsellers to find the best books and have only been disappointed by this one. At least I can return it to Amazon for a credit and buy the right book next time.Retire Mr. Trester. It is time.
902	untitled: Perhaps I didn't read the product description carefully enough, but I was disappointed with this product. The kit did come with the ball and a book, but the book was a short "cardboard" type. The exercises were few and poorly described. The book contained no new or remarkable information. Definitely not "miraculous". pat
903	DEFECTIVE AFTER 3 WEEKS: I purchased this for my car, and after 3 weeks, it went defective, dying on my wife while driving with my kids!What a pain, hassle, and headache. Took it to Firestone and though I ended up paying more its been several months and so far no issues. I know at least if something did go wrong they would just fix it. But this review isn't about firestone, but about this product. Bad product.
904	Young Fatal Attraction: This movie is great. I just bought it the other day and rushed home to watch it. I throughly enjoyed it entirely, I believe it kind of relates to Fatal Attraction!
905	What happened to Growltiger?: I liked this dvd, but I saw the Broadway cast perform this, and the very best part was Growltiger - what happened to that scene in the DVD?? I can't believe they dropped this very excellent, pivotal act from the movie!!!
906	Excellent Regulator, well done: The regulator is just as advertised, and delivered as advertised. Many Oxygen suppliers make a fortune charging extra for one more regulator when you have more then one size tank. This is an outstanding regulator, above my requirements, and works perfect. I will buy from them again without reservations..
907	NOT AS GOOD AS IT USED TO BE: MY MOTHER AND I USED TO GET THIS MAGAZINE FOR MANY MANY YEARS IN THE PAST. I DECIDED TO TRY IT AGAIN AFTER NOT SUBSCRIBING FOR A LONG TIME. I AM GOING TO CANCEL. THE ARTICLES OVER THE LAST THREE MAGAZINES HAVE BEEN USELESS AND UNINTERESTING TO ME. ALSO, THE MAGAZINE SIZE IS SO MUCH SMALLER THAN IT USED TO BE. NOT A GOOD VALUE LIKE IT USED TO BE.
908	Awesome CD: I have always love Randy Travis's music. I heard 3 Wooden Crosses and several other songs on the CD and knew I wanted to buy when I had the chance. I am anxiously waiting for it to arrive.My Favorite songs...3 Wooden Crosses, When Mama Prayed, and Pray for the fish to name a few. Great job Randy! When is the next CD coming?
909	WOW - so dreamy, so gripping...: I've read a few vampire books in my day and this is up there with the best. I had no idea what to expect. I was very impressed. I will definitely continue to explore this author's work, and I'll certainly see the film in December.
910	DONT BUY IT: Dude, I'm brazilian, and I live in Rio. this movie is a big lie, its all wrong! dont waste your money buying this... buy elite squad, which is waaaaaay much better! trust me!
911	No longer a shopper at Amazon: I have shopped at Amazon for years and used "one click" feature frequently. Years ago, my kids received a North Pole Express Train as a gift and years later it stopped working. I was excited to find one online at Amazon and immediately purchased it using "one click" It was afterwards, beyond the 30 day returned period, that I discovered the toy I purchased from Amazon could be purchased at Target and elsewhere for nearly 80% less. An expensive lesson learned and Amazon has lost a customer for good.TJCarson City, Nevada
912	Great quality picture: We DVR ths show but missed this one since it was delayed an hour due to a football game. So we watched on Amazon steaming. The picture was excellent, even better than the DVR picture.
913	I turned it off because of my kid: What every other one star said. Heavy racial stereotypes. My husband is a regionally well known, published historian, and he did not find anything redeeming from an historical perspective.They are pretty old animation sequences, but I don't have a problem with the "quality" per se of the animation as a general viewer. But there is no way my child is watching these for entertainment and we are calling it a teaching moment when my alternative is to turn it off and teach her that is the appropriate response. Its free on Netflix, BTW. I would have been pretty upset if we had paid to rent it.Remember uncle Remus? That kind of thing. Disney put that in the vault and won't let it out for a good reason. Romanticizing derogatory stereotypes or feeling nostalgic about entertainment with racist overtones is inappropriate. But if you must, please do not indelibly etch these images into your child's consciousness.
914	Five stars for the second act: The Papa Germont/Violeta duet is the best I've ever heard.The only problem of this Traviata is the tenor.I listen to this one and to the Scotto recording with Muti interchangeably.
915	Great Product: I have been using these swiffer dusters for a long time and could not get along without them. I am so happy that they now have just the refills and delighted to get them through Amazon, as I never did see them in grocery stores or drugstores.
916	Worth the price????: It's true that the whole package idea with the story and the creepy ambient stuff with the whispers is compelling enough to make you want to buy this disc. Unfortunately, it's not worth the money. Yes, it is a well done thirty-two minutes of halloween noise. Current 93 has done some amazing work, but this is just a fun muscle-flex. Better to go with "Emblems" as a starting point, or maybe "Thunder Perfect Mind" or "Goddy" for more classic C93. Spend wisely.
917	Love this!: To say we have a substantial Thomas collection is an understatement, but I must admit that this is one of my personal favorites. What makes Trevor stand out from the other characters is that his "traction" wheels actually turn when he moves. Cool to watch, fun to play with, and somewhat educational, too. (cause & effect) It is also a little bit smaller than the average car or engine, which makes it ideal for tacking on long trains. A five star addition to your Thomas set!
918	Wire miswired: Not sure how, but the wire from this manufacturer was miswired. Plug the 3.5mm all the way in and you get stereo sound but no video. Pull it halfway out and you get video but only left speaker.
919	Q U A C K: The QUACK who's charged the most desperate cancer patients hundreds of thousands of dollars to participate in trials of his unproven therapy - trials that have not only ignored the ethical prohibition against charging patients to participate in trials, but have also failed to publish meaningful results demonstrating the effectiveness of the treatment. Hundreds of patients, driven to desperation by their disease, have resorted to begging in the press for money to receive the treatments only to die penniless.
920	A Different Approach, yet as vicious as ever.: Like my title says, Anaal Nathrakh have taken a different approach this time around, adding more creative and melodic elements to their vicious assault of black metal. After the first listen I was slightly dissapointed, since this wasn't nearly as mind-numbingly brutal as their previous albums(although it is still pretty friggin' heavy). But I suprised myself the next day by having various songs stuck in my head and decided to give a second listen to "Domine non es Dignus", some parts that really stuck in my head were the clean vocals on "Do not speak" and the marching at the beginning of "To err is human to dream futile". I love the fact that Anaal Nathrakh have grown more creative but still remain true to staying totally necro. This is an essential black metal purchase alongside "The Codex Necro" and "Total F*cking Necro".
921	one of my favorite shows of all time: V the Series is on DVD and it's about time!The Series never had the budget of the two mini series and it definitely shows. The lower budget adds to the fun and charm of the episodes though. I even liked the fact that they killed major characters on the show from time to time since that kept it exciting. I just wish the show had lasted longer or that it was followed by another mini series. WE NEED MORE V!
922	Not for climbing, and ones that are start at only a slightly higher price: Obviously this isn't rated for climbing, and in fact isn't really good for any application requiring strength. There are plenty of inexpensive carabiners that are rated for weight (and climbing) that start at only a couple of dollars more. This isn't worth much anything to be honest.
923	Ehh: As far as Im concerned, he could have been murderd or just as much commited suicide. No one will EVER know. Personally though I think he comitted suicide, but thats just me. If you want a good look at both sides, watch this movie then read Heavier Than Heaven, because it could change your thinking.
924	Don't waste your money!: Well I had heard great things about this book so I finally decided to read it.I threw it away after about 3 chapters. It's stupid. It just keeps saying the same thing "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" 30 different ways. We all know men don't speak the same language as we do so I thought overall it was just stating what I already knew and did nothing to help.
925	An Upbeat, Fast-paced Fantasy: Although I enjoyed the loyalty of the characters, and the comical acts put on by the evil Queen Tsarmania, this book wasn't quite my type. It is totally a "just for fun" book, as in the fact that you don't exactly glean a lot from reading it other then some humorous moments. Also, the characters are so plainly black and white, good or bad, making it very fairytale/folktaleish. Although I'm glad I got a taste of this type of literature by reading this book, I don't think I'd read another in the series. Give it a try though!
926	Bible curriculum for homeschoolers: I bought this as a fun video for my boys (ages 7 and 8) based on the songs by the Bentley Brothers , and I had no idea it would be packed full of such amazing information. I will absolutely purchase the other titles in the series, and I would love to see some curriculum published to go along with the videos. These would make fabulous homeschool or church curriculum starters! And, the Bentley Brothers do not disappoint!
927	reads like a Dorothy Parker biography: Really good plot for a novel which borders on chick-lit but has much more depth to it. Sara Frost is a Bronte-expert (lots of interesting tidbits about the Bronte family in book too) whose fiance, Paul (the loser) leaves her to find himself in Paris for a year. In the meanwhile, Sara goes in search of lost Bronte letters and travels herself, in literary circles. I kept being reminded of Dorothy Parker's life of pen as well.This novel flows and makes the reader want more literature for the soul by the end. Super debut!
928	Hurts so good: Death Cab for Cutie take pop where it needs to go. They combine the slow, beautiful ache of Mogwai with obvious references like Built to Spill and Elliott Smith. I'm not hearing any Modest Mouse here, this music holds a different kind of tension. The only comparison i can think of is when "Title Track"'s production blossoms, it lifts me the same way the first chorus of "Moon and Antarctica"'s "3rd Planet" does. This music may be boring to some, but it moves at exactly my pace. The melodies often mine similar territory, but the songs are so well crafted you never get that "these songs all sound the same" feeling. I don't generally gush like this over albums, but DCFC brings up feelings I haven't felt in a long time and I'm thankful for that.
929	Charles de Lint has done it again!: This is yet another book of his where you will find yourself absorbed so thoroughly that you don't want to put it down.For anyone that has ever loved fantasy novels you will find his mixture of fantasy an reality purely enthralling. I would recommend any of his books to you.
930	A Perfect Gift, And a Wonderful story: I was forced to read this book in my school. Though I hate being forced to read books, I found this one the best out of all the ones we were forced to read. Yes, I consider this book better than To Kill a Mockingbird and Cry, The Beloved Country. It is very heartwarming and touched me so far, that it makes me as a 15 year old male want to cry. If you could just picture yourself in the place of Gene, it really makes you think about the hardships of what they must have gone through. The one music peace that reminds me of this book is 3 Doors Down's "Loser". It almost sounds like the book! THIS IS A MUST READ!
931	what a shame: It's a shame that this is one of the few recordings of the Liebermann Sonata available. Katherine Kemler's rendition of the Muczynski sonata isn't too bad, but her Liebermann has some serious problems with it. Wrong notes are abundant, and the execution of the piece is just very sloppy in general (particularly in the second movement). I'm not particulary impressed with her use of vibrato or choice of phrasing either, although perhaps this is a matter of taste. But in an edited recording there's really no excuse for so many blatant errors. The Liebermann Sonata is a good piece, and it deserves better.
932	Great Customer Service: The log set I ordered was not in stock, so the vendor phoned me and helped very much in suggesting alternate sets and checking inventory. The logs were very easy to install. They look and work great!
933	disappointment: Another disappointment from Cohen; Predictable sketches and worn out cliches make for a dull viewing. Would not pay money for this product.
934	No live footage on dvd.: Dont waste your money on this filth. I was duped again by the sticker on the cd/dvd set. The dvd does not have any live footage. Your bonus is that you get to watch a reel to reel start up and watch pictures of the concert. I was beligerent when I noticed this as I cannot take it back now that the package has been opened. Buy the cd instead and save about 8 to 10 bucks. The cd is fantastic with awesome versions of Cowgirl in the Sand and Down By the River! Dont be fooled by the writing on the package. The company that put this together must have been very desperate to make some money. Why would you want to put still pictures on a dvd? Beats me! Hope this helps everyone as none of the other reviews seem to mention this!
935	more fiction than fact: The title and reviews give the impression that this book is a collection of the black arts and secrets of analog design. It isn't. 80% of the chapters are old-timers' "when I were a lad" stories. It's not necessarily a bad book - it's highly entertaining and well-written, and new graduates will find the real-life hints and caveats useful, but if you have more than a few years of experience in the industry, don't expect to be educated.
936	Poor Experience: I will be returning the product to Amazon. The cases in which the dvds were received in were bent and warped. It almost appears as if this was stored in a high humidity climate. Worst off, none of the discs are reading in my dvd player.
937	Food Saver bags: They keep my food fresh and no more freezer burn.....I buy food in bulk so these bags are saving me money right now a must for food storage
938	I don't know what's to like about this book!: Interesting and suspect that there is only one review and of course its "raving". This book has not merit and is not worth the time it takes to read it.
939	Originally "Bushman at Large".: Decent book about the seamy side of life in the Outback around the start of the first World War. Definitely not "Politically Correct" but therefore a much more accurate portrayal of the lives these men led. Notice that I said "men" - there is no "love interest" at all in the book. It follows the group of men into the disastrous Gallipoli campaign. I limit 5 stars to books that I want to read once a year (at least) and 4 stars to books that I will re-read at least once. This falls pretty much in the 4 star group, but certainly not any better than that.
940	Sony MDR-V150 Monitor Series Headphones: Just wonderful. Comfortable, good stereo and sound quality, and great volume(Labeled L & R for easy placement. Price is also reasonably low.Sony MDR-V150 Monitor Series Headphones with Reversible Earcups
941	High spirits: An older film, but hugely enjoyable. The legendary Peter O'Toole turns his anciet and crumbling family manse into an allegedly haunted castle, to attract tourists and pay his irascible landlord. Things take a turn for the spookily amusing when the actual ghosts determine to have their own way. Darryl Hannah and Liam Neeson are delightful as the 15th century ghosts who turn the tides for the better interactions between the castle inhabitants, the ghosts, the tourists and themselves.
942	Defective- BOTH TIMES: Got defective memory cards the first time. Wrote e-mail to the seller, and they shipped me a 2-pack of new ones. (I have to give them this- they were fast in replying, and DID ship me brand new cards) However, it doesn't seem like they test anything that they ship out, because the new cards that they sent me were defective too.I didn't feel like pressing it anymore, so I didn't complain about those and went to another site to buy REAL WORKING ones.Oh well.
943	Great hairsetters: Love these curlers---great for trips or even for "hair touch-ups"-ONly bad thing about them is the clips don't hold the hair tightly in place.
944	DO NOT BUY this book: This book is something NO new mother should read. So depressing. I bought it for my BFF after she had her baby and then she lent it to me before mine was born and I found it really depressing. I felt bad that I bought it for her.Skip it, it isn't worth the $.
945	Great Wall Mount - Confusing Specs: I purchased this wall mount for my new 55" Samsung LED TV. It was easy to install and seems very sturdy. The Amazon listing states "for 37" to 56" TVs". When the item arrived, the packaging said 30" to 50". I checked on the Sanus website and it says that this mount is for 37" to 56" TVs. I have an older 30" to 50" Sanus mount in my basement and this new model is larger, but the inconsistent labling is confusing. I was able to mount my 55" TV with no difficulty. PLEASE correct the labling issues so that we can buy with confidence that it will perform as advertised.
946	Classic late-60's electronic rock/psychedelica: This is classic late-60's electronic rock/psychedelica from a group whose rise to minor stardom was as meteoric as its plunge into (undeserved) obscurity. 'Lothar' is a Theremin, one of the first electronic instruments and a staple of bad 50's sci-fi movie scores. Anyone who's ever seen one played will understand the 'Hand People'. Aside from Lothar's contributions, there's some outstanding lead and bass guitar. The music is protopunk meets early industrial music, with a healthy dose of humor. The first track, 'Machines', was two decades ahead of its time: I vividly recall the discomfort it caused on American Bandstand when kids accustomed to Boddy Sherman tried to "dance to it". On the other hand, 'Bye Bye Love' is a tremendous cover of the Everly Brothers tune. Be sure to wear your headphones, or you'll miss half the fun.
947	The Best, don't look further: I read this book so fast, the way it was written was so interesting and easy, evey single question I had in mind was answered, nothing is left! I loved the book, unfortunately I cannot get the Ace the IT INTERVIEW book, because it is not available in my area, but I would definetly the interview book too! by the way there is a very good chapter about interview in this book!four little things i hated about this book:- much more of network than software development ! but it is ok coz most careers are in Network administration.- in a resume there was: Modem Software!!, this is called Browser...!- adding Norton AntiVirus in an IT resume is something stupid!- PHP and C-Sharp: top programming lanuges not mentioned in the book!
948	Less is More when it comes to talking during yoga: A lot of this video (at least, the first disc) is Seane talking rapidly about how one should experience their practice. She seems overly self-conscious, and is so focused on describing what she's doing in as many words possible that it's hard to follow her meaning. Her chatter was so distracting made it impossible for me to focus on the practice itself. I didn't watch the second DVD because I was so frustrated with the first one. Look up Seane Corn on Youtube if you want to see if this video is right for you.
949	A very good read: This book is well written, informative, accessible, and provides a comprehensive picture of the big players in Korean politics over the last few decades, from the US Military to the dictators it supported to the institutional forces that destabilized that dictatorship and the popular mass movements that finally toppled it and have created a strong liberal democracy in its place. I recommend it to anyone interested in getting a handle on the basics of Korean politics and/or East Asian politics in general.
950	Pope Joan: Although after reading the prologue I wanted to put the book down, I continued reading and was glad that I did. Pope Joan turned out to be a very interesting read - even if you're not into reading about history.Although I am in the dark about the dark ages and the Catholic religion, this book kept me riveted with its realistic characters, events, portrayal of women, and love story. It is exceptionally well-written and a hard act to follow.Trying to review it won't do it justice, but just look at how many stars it received and take a chance - you won't be sorry.
951	not worth the money disappointed: didn't live up to my expectation.as others have said can go and purchase same items at a cheaper price.very disappointed
952	A Let Down: After reading the entertaining "Master of Desire", I expected far more than I got from "Taming the Scotsman". Although there were parts of the story that held my interest, I found myself skipping tons and tons of pages of sexual play and the characters rehashing their emotional problems, trying to get back to the thread of the story. It seems to me the story should be the foundation and the sexual tension and emotional second guessing should be secondary, not primary. Highly disappointing.
953	Voranado needs to redo this model!!!!: I have owned Voranado products before and have been very happy with them...but this Digital Display model needs help!I had the same issues as another reviewer...I would set the temp for 75 and it would show a room temp of 85 - just for kicks we set the temp to 85 and it showed a room temp of 95 ! And there is no way that was the actual room temp !I didn't read the reviews, as I should have - So I requested a replacement instead of a refund.I received it, took it out of the box and the front fell off ! -The screws that hold on the front housing are missing!!!!!2 defective units from the same company makes me very concerned. I love the thought of a digital display, but obviously they need to work the bugs out. I hope they do a recall, these units seem dangerous - judging by some of the other reviews.
954	Fun camera!: this is cool! it dose not magnify things that much, but it magnifys more than a normal camera, but for the price it's good.
955	the best dvd ever!!!!: This is the best yoga DVD i have ever used. I have been doing yoga at home for over 5 years, but never like this. I am getting such a great work out. I feel my body changing from all the movemets. Eva has a great way of describing and showing all the yoga moves. I would highly recomend this DVD.
956	Stare - A challenging and fun game for the whole family: My younger sister and I helped to choose the cards for Stare! Junior Edition from the adult version. I am 10 years old and my sister is seven. We looked for cards that were colourful, not too detailed and that we thought would appeal to children. We love playing Stare because it challenges you to be observant, pay attention to details and tests your memory. The vocabulary is simple enough that my sister can read most of the questions on her own. It helps young kids learn colours, numbers and where things are in the picture. Example: in front of, beside, left and right etc. My whole family enjoys playing Stare together and we hope you and your family will too!
957	Great to cook with and easy to clean.: For the affordable price I am very happy with this cookware set. All I wanted was a 10 piece set with see through lids. One can not beat good stainless steal to cook with and ease of cleaning. I would recommend this set to anyone who is budget minded. Compared with the outrageous prices of other brands ,who are just not worth the money, I would pick Faberware any time!
958	Best Handbook in Power: I am a PhD candidate in Power Engineering and I found this book the most trusted handbook in Power electrical engineering; however you should have some experience or knowledge about power system to understand the examples.
959	Good Keychain: I love this keychain! Its really cute and I love it. I love bleach and I love Orihime. I recommonded any Bleach keychains if your a bleach fan. This is the best keychain I ever brought.
960	could not finish!: I like many others here have read most, if not all of Anne's books. For the life of me I could not finish this one! I found myself skipping pages and looking at the last page of the book. This is something I haven't done since I was 11 years old.There seemed to be no real connection between Stephan and Triana. Sentences were disjointed and bewildering to follow or understand. It's like she went on a really bad acid trip and decided to write a book about it.
961	Storage case is the worst!!!: The Picture shows a nice storage case as I am familiar with. But the one I received was cheap and crappy to the max!!!! The storage inserts are not even close to the size of the box and extremely flimsy beyond belief, They are shrink wrapped and then glued to the box so when you unwrap it there is no means by witch to secure the trays. they are too small to fit snugly and are about useless. The knives themselves are acceptable but if you are looking for storage for them this case is not worth the low grade plastic within it. Not happy. :(
962	Bleh.: "What's The 411?" (featuring Biggie), "My Love" and "Love No Limit" are all off the hook remixes. The rest are pretty boring. Yawn. Puffy did a terrible job on "Changes I've Been Going Through." Turned a really nice song into generic background music. "Real Love" and "Reminisce" I listen to once in awhile. There is no remix for "Slow Down," a song from What's The 411? that I liked pretty well. Instead it was replaced with some other song I never heard of before. Die hard fans only.
963	Waltham rocks (literally)!!!!!!!1: This CD is good for anybody who likes rock music. It's also good for someone who likes bands that write their own music. Forget Britney. Forget Justin. Hell, forget New Found Glory! This music is better than anything that they could possibly come up with.
964	Great for learning, not as good as reference book: I found this book very useful, whether you are learning Hebrew from scratch or whether you are refreshing or formalizing your knowledge of the language. The book is structured in an increasing complexity order, which is good if you are reading the whole book sequentially, but makes it very inconvenient if you just want to look something up. What makes this even worse is the lack of an alphabetical index at the end of the book.
965	What a Disappointment!: What a disappointment! I expected an adventure story with a headstrong, female protagonist with a mystery looming on the horizon. What do I buy? An adventure stor with a headstrong, female protagonist with a mystery looming on the horizon THAT IS SOLVED BY HER HUSBAND. Plus, how could Abigail fall in love with a man who has a terrible, ugly lust for her body? He never loved her, never grows to love her, yet she changes and becomes a model wife. It was sickening. Don't read it!
966	CAUSED *HOURS* of wasted time!: I just noticed another reviewer posted a similar issue.MacBook Pro (latest version) will simply not sleep with this card installed.Unfortunately, I did not notice this problem immediately after installing the card, and it was pretty far down on my troubleshooting list. I spend hours eliminating other possibilities before I removed the card and the problem resolved instantly.I previously had an Adata card which did not have this problem, but unfortunately died for other reasons.Overall conclusion: AVOID.
967	Do not purchase from Kantrexplaza: I ordered 2 Primera 53318 Signature III Color Ink Cartridges ($74)and Both were Defective, one printed all Green and the other would not print at all. Is sent a request to kantrexplaza the company that Amazon site sent me to.I have sent several request to return the products and have only received responses from Amazon..Kantrexplaza never returned my Calls or responded to my email..So I now have to re-order the cartridges which will not be from kantrexplaza...I don't understand why companies don't back up the products they sell..This Sucks..
968	Possibly the worst movie I will ever see: If you enjoy plot holes, a killer with a seemingly endless suppy of time and money to spend on torture devices and surveillance equipment and a plot twist at the end where it is discovered that the identity of the killer was not some well thought-out clever surprise, but rather some guy just pulled out of the writer's buttocks - then this is the movie for you.
969	A disappointing purchase: The Hamilton Beach Ice cream maker is going to be a disappointment if you are attempting to make ice cream in a warm climate (such as here in Key West ) without the AC turned on. I couldnt get the HB to get the ice cream cold enough even though the container was cooled in the freezer at maximum setting for 48 hours and was additionally insulated with a towel. It ended up as soft ice cream. I cant recommend this product.
970	mummy tummy review: Some of the exercises in this book were good but Tupler made a number of comments about the negative effects of some pilates exercises. The comments were inaccurate and showed that she had a very limited and incorrect understanding of that discipline. She commented that the Pilates hundred will cause diastasis of the abdominal muscles. When done correctly in a neutral pelvis this exercise will actually correct diastasis. It will only make it worse if it is practiced incorrectly. Her lack of knowledge on this subject, that she commented on over and over, really made me question her knowledge on everything else.
971	Bad, Bad, Bad,Bad, Badddddd: What a piece of crap! I had been using these "Norton" products for years.( Since the REAL NORTON was around). The products, including this one are so buggy that you will have serious problems after you install them. They give you bug fixes, updates, etc. Every time you install or update them, it keeps getting worse and you have to actually reinstall the product many times. After you have reinstalled the product 5 times you are then told that you have installed this the maximum amount and will no longer function. I sent emails etc. and got no response. You could call, but they make you pay for support. Stay away from this product. Guess they are now off shoring these products, because it is a real stinker!!! Don't say you were not warned. Good bye Symantec. Never again. The REAL NORTON would not have let this out the door.
972	horrific: When i purchased this cd I put complete confidence in my favorite band of the time, FTF. I was utterly dissapointed with my purchace. I bought a fifteen doller single.(I know what you are being the only good song on the cd.) I never would have thought that FTF would turn classic rock to get a shot at the mainstreem. I thought maybe I would keep it for my new romance cd- to slow dance to and all, but only because dico-round won't give me any money for it. I love FTF, but this isn't Face to Face- it's Trevor Keith's Anthology. Don't buy it
973	Oral Irrigator: Excellent product. Easy to use and carry in purse or brief case or at home in themedicine cabinet. It has all the benefits of the standard irrigator, but is veryportable.
974	I'm a hardcore early David Bowie fan BUT: This concert film stinks! The camerawork is worse than clumsy--it looks like something a spastic with a Handicam would have done. And the sound quality is horrible. It must have been wonderful to be at Hammersmith Odeon when this concert was performed, but it sure didn't translate well onto film. Listen to the recordings and skip this disaster.
975	Bad!: After I heard that John Woo was going to be making Mission Impossible 2. I new that it would be all action and no plot. Boy was I right and everyone else out there who predicted the same. I understand that movies are here for us to enjoy. But I predicted 98% of this film. The chase on the mountain with the car was ok but the motorcycle chase was totally unbelievable. Cruise is not at all believeable enough, to be able to flip a gun up in the air from the sand with his foot like he did at the end. I did not enjoy this film from the begining. The acting was cheap and bad. Only Anthony Hopkins was good. The sound and special effects were also bad. Grade:D+
976	A Great Book: A great book. The treatment of the crew of the US liberty by the press and the government they served will forever be a dark chapter in US history. Interesting timing of the counter book, this topic was given the blackout treatment for decades until people started comparing it to Sept 11. Now suddenly a book comes out to refute it. Very interesting!Israel never does anything wrong. ... For every event there is a good and long explanation for every major contravesy that shows that israels critics are just big mean anti-semites. Israel is simply never wrong.Israel has long used the tactic of faking attacks by other countries. They think they are so smart and the rest of the world is so stupid that they can use the same trick over and over and over and no one will be the wiser.Read this book and then read the detractors statements it will help you interpret the controlled media's output as well.
977	A Page Turner...: I too, am puzzled by negative reviews of this story. From the first page I couldn't put it down. The characters were very real and likeable (or unlikeable in the case of the evil ones). Robert Newcomb took the time to help you get to know the characters and the land they live in. I found The Fifth Sorceress to be a wonderful story filled with all the aspects a fan of high fantasy needs. From the friendly and brotherly banter of Frederick and Tristan, to the attack on Eutracia, Robert Newcomb kept me hooked into the story. I can't wait to read more by this talented new author.
978	obnoxiously bad: This entire series is ridiculous and insults my intelligence. I can scarcely follow the characters development, for they seemingly alter fundamental personality traits at the drop of a hat. The entire juvenile plot is built like some fifth grade fairy tale, with random plot elements built in willy-nilly like the contraption of some insane inventor's apprentice. I can't believe I sat through the first two, and half of the third one. Stay away.
979	Joss Whedon is a genius!: The best t.v. show ever and the spin-off movie 'Serenity' is one of the best movies EVER! Both a MUST SEE!
980	Great light for specific uses: This light is a great product if you have the need to put a very focused beam of light very far in front of your vehicle. It is more focused than your typical driving light, and is mostly useful for racing purposes. At this price point these are the best around.
981	Yup, it's a belt for my Hoover vacuum cleaner: Probably the best belt I've ever purchased for my vacuum cleaner... Seriously though, replacing the belt is super easy. All you need is a screw driver and about 15 minutes.
982	Disappointment: Don't bother reading this book, everything you need to know is found in the Bible. Harris' book flaunts and romanticizes chivary, when in reality love never boasts.
983	Not just once in a blue moon: The second book in the Harry Dresden series does it again: this time it's werewolves. Harry continues on his adventures as the most hard-boiled wizard in Chicago, it's fun and engaging. The characters that started in the first book grow here, Harry (really Bob, but you could have guessed that) gives you a great tutorial on werewolf theory, and there's a twisted, tricky mystery to solve.
984	Benny and Joon: This was such a wonderful light-hearted movie. It makes you believe in love all over again. Take the time to see this one... it leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside. Enjoy!
985	Excellent voices and "acting out".: Martin Jarvis and Rosalind Ayres give a captivating account of the ESSENCE or essential stories of the Old and especially New Testaments. It is a must for those who don't have the time to read the whole Bible and put the various Books of the Bible in chronological order as you read it. Even if you have read the whole Bible or are going to read it, you must listen to this audio to put it all together in a wonderful meaningful way in your mind!
986	Loud: I now understand why this was upgraded by the manufacturer. Though the toy is appealing to my child the internal parts are extremely loud. This is not a toy that will help put the child to sleep because of the volume of the internal parts.
987	Great playing can barely be heard over the hiss & noise: The song selections and Art's playing are truly awesome, but,the sound quality of the first ten tracks is downright pitiful!Track #11, 'Wee Baby Blues' with band & Joe Turner singing, ismore a novelty tune. The 'clean' tracks, #13 thru #19 are allfrom the double-CD release: Art Tatum 20th century piano genius- which is probably a better option. The remaining good track,#12: 'I Got Rhythm' (w/ Tiny Grimes and Slam Stewart) is fromthe CD: I Got Rhythm: Art Tatum Volume 3 (1935-1944)- listen to this disc before buying it!
988	effective: A down to earth exposition, should excite further reading and the convertion of the mind and heart; appropriate for the informed Christian, the skeptic and the unbeliever truly searching. Mr. P. Kreeft has an effective writing style.
989	good cover of Beethoven!: It's great! Beethoven rocks and Liszt made it better! Great performance, great recording, great music. Liszt turned Beethoven's soundtrack to the play "Ruins of Athens" into a single movement of a piano concerto.
990	Very dissapointed: Based on the reviews and the average 5 star rating I thought I would upgrade from my 15 year old 25 inch Zenith, hoping to get significant improvement in resolution quality. However, the resolution was not much better than my old TV, ...
991	Didn't last a year!: I ordered this product based on reviews, and I must say I was somewhat disappointed that is wasn't as good as my last BaByliss.It is powerful, but it isn't as hot as my last dryer. As a result, it takes longer to dry my hair. I have very fine, thin hair, so this isn't a huge issue. However, if you have thick hair, it would definitely take longer.In addition, this dryer makes my hair much more flat than my last BaByliss.I do like the fact that they have changed the shape and place of the buttons. I don't inadvertently change the settings or turn the dryer off while drying my hair.It's a good dryer for the price, but I wish I had spent more money and bought one much like my last.11/5/10 Update:The dryer didn't even last a year! It no longer works. I would not recommend this dryer.
992	Stylish WWII noir drama: Stylish film about a Jewish actress who must go into hiding in Nazi occupied Prague in the 30s and her husband, a radio journalist, who gains prominence as a spokesman for the occupiers. Their fortunes, prominence and notoriety reverse; she bridles at her confinement and obscurity, he thrives in the limelight. And then ...A tense noir drama.
993	looks like much more expensive watch, but no battery???: I just received this watch - love the look - but the watch did not work. I assume there is no battery or the battery is dead - still need to check as a special tool is required to open the case.
994	Bring back the old buttoneer: They ruined it. It was a nifty product and something that worked really great. These new fasteners are horrible. I bought one to give to my daughter who was going away to college. My mom gave me one that is 32 years old now when I went away to college. I use that so many times. I thought it would help her. Not so.
995	DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING, FALSE PRODUCT PICTURES: I posted pictures of the actual product as received. I also feel duped after purchasing this product based upon the Amazon description. I was under the impression that I was buying a Hoover brand product at a great price, based on the posted photograph, product description and some of the customer reviews. I was wrong. The product is some cheaper quality Chinese knock off. I mistakenly bought one of these before and it broke the first time I tried to clean it. I could have paid $3.00 more for "Genuine Hoover", if I had only read the recent reviews first! I guess I have learned once again that I get what I pay for.Hoover 40140201 Replacement Long-Life HEPA Cartridge Filter
996	A Perfect fit: These jeans look great, have full denim weight of Levi's and fit much better In the thighes and rear than the relaxed one's so often sold everywhere.Besides 501's these are a favorite Levi'sThe Stonewashed Is a good color. Goes with my Jean Jacket.
997	Horrible documentary!: I guess you'd have to be on drugs to get this. Collectors will need it for the collection but this documentary was absurd. A big waste of time. I found myself wanted to fast forward often. I expected more from Nikolas Schrek.
998	Leaky Hose: This is the first time I was unhappy with a purchase from Amazon. The hose connections leak at both ends. It is clearly a poor knock-off of the original. I am sorry that I bought it but use in infrequently so I did not bother with the hassle of returning it. I just will never purchase anything else from that company. I have purchased other things from other companys over the years and been pleased.
999	Returned Ours: Wanted to like it for the price, however had two major issues with it.First the screw hole, for the bracket that attaches the bikes together, was not drilled fully on one of the four holes.Secondly the attachment for the handle bars, that is supposed to hold it vertically in place, would not work. Called the manufacturer to get a relacement and that one didnt work either.All in all it is seems like it would be a good product if it were tested before being packaged, but just didn't trust it to use so it went back.
1000	Excellent Product: Easily the best mobile DVD player you can buy for the car, short of having an expensive professional system installed.This unit is also safer than those "in a bag" portable DVD players, which hang on the back of the seat. Imagine what would happen in a car accident with one of those. I wouldn't want to be sitting behind it.The RCA rests on the seat, and is buckled in with the seatbelt, a much better (and safer) design.The only downside is there is no battery, but if you are using this for the car, or for a hotel room, you simply don't need one.
1001	the type of CD that allows you to shut off the world: This cd is truly amazing it is the best CD I have ever bought, I can listen to it over and over again and I never get tired of it. I have found some other good CD's but nothing compares to this one. When ever I listen to it, it brings me into another world wether I am happy or sad. Its absolutely the best.
1002	be transported!: What can one say about Snatam? If you like sacred music (chanting the name of God) this is a winner. The back-up music is a dream and the mood created is blissful. I never heard a Snatam song I didn't like! She is magic! Great album...you won't be disappointed.
1003	Rose Quartz Pendant: Silver Insanity Sterling Silver Rose Pendant. I am disappointed with the pendant. It is very large and the quality is not as viewed in picture.
1004	Worth it: My husband and I were not able to attend a birthing class, so the doctor suggested we rent/buy a video. We decided on this one, and although the 'teacher' was a bit corny it was helpful. I especially liked that you could fast forward and skip parts! All in all it was a worthwhile purchase and proved helpful to us both.
1005	A Must-Have Collectors Set: This is a great gift from Viz to us. In the Special Edition boxed set are the first 3 DVDs in the series, all in one case, not individually boxed (like they are usually sold), two trading cards, mini-poster (If you have the Action Pack, its that same poster), a calendar which is held in a CD-like case (each month is seperate, but still very nice graphics), and they are all packaged in a silver Collector's box. ^_^ The DVD quiality is the greatest you can have (a HUGE improvement from the Parts 1-9 in Japanese only) but I recommend having DVD 4 around so you don't get annoyed .I highly recommend this DVD and all the others in the series for all Anime fans. Action, Romance, Horror, Mystery, this anime has it all.
1006	New to Kindle Books: I am new to kindle books and found this book for free. Boy, make sure you go in and READ about the book before you even download it. I can read a book in a day this book took me over a week to read. I COULD NOT stay with this book. I made myself finish it but was driving myself nuts doing so. I didn't even want to give this book one start. I am so glad I did not have to purchase this I would of wanted my money back.
1007	Buy the Audio CD and save your dough: This is one of my favorite albums and after the re-engineering work on Fleetwood Mac's Rumours and The Eagles' Hotel California and ELP's Brain Salad Surgery I was prepared for something special by one of the premiere producers of all time.Boy was I dissapointed. This disk (we're talking about the DVD-Audio) is nothing more than a 24 bit transfer of the master tape. Not DTS, not Dolby Digital, nuthin'! I listened to the CD and this disk on the same equipment and could tell way too little difference to warrant the expense. Save your dough.And shame on you A. P. Get off your duff and remix this for 5.1 or stay out of the DVD-Audio market. This is very deceptive. At the very least make sure the sound quality is so much better that the price is justified.
1008	A great expose': This autobiography by the son of a famous father-son team of oil barons is very absorbing. It gives insights into the nether world of oil-money-politics as it developed in the early 20th century. One character after another comes onto the stage, and we are privy to the innermost activities of all, through this book. Put aside your prejudices, your class connection to learn about how the other one percent lived.
1009	Nightshift: The audio stories that came along with the collection wre very well done and portrayed by the narrator. Many of the stories dark and scary. Although all the stories from Night Shift were not included, the ones that were were done good.
1010	An Oldie but a Goodie: One of the best things about ebooks and the Kindle is getting to read old romances that we enjoyed years ago. That's certainly true with The Black Duke's Prize. I think this was Suzanne Enoch's first novel, and I remember loving the story and the heroine (Katherine Ralston). Well, I just read this wonderful story again, and I don't think it has aged a bit.
1011	it was a defective product and i have applied for refund: I have purchased hundreds of things from amazon but for the first time this pressure cooker turned out to be defective.The lid is leaking and the device does not develop pressure.it was completely worthless.We have applied for refund and we are thinking of buying a different pressure cooker.I thought Hawkins was a reputable name however they proved us wrong ,by selling defective pieces online.From now on I will double check ,anything i buy from Hawkins..
1012	"Do you Dare?": I dare and urge all woman to buy CURIOUS! ITs so good! I personally love it so much, and any woman that wore it would just steal my attention. I can not give Britney props enough, for creating such an empowering scent! TRULY AMAZING!
1013	Don't Waste Your Money: This is one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. There are some good pics of the guys as kids, but that's about it. Most of the footage has been taken from other KOL videos already out there, such as Excess All Areas, Live at the O2, and, of all things, the "Use Somebody" music video. This documentary features interviews with three different ladies (their identities are unknown- we are never given any information to let us know why their opinions matter), two of whom can't even pronounce Caleb's name and keep calling him "Cauleb". In addition, some of the information is clearly incorrect. They keep referring to the Followills' father as "Ivan", which is technically his first name, but he goes by his middle name of Leon. Overall, a horrible waste of my time and the $10 I spent on it, and this is coming from a HUGE KOL fan. If you want to find out about the band, just look on Wikipedia. You'll get better information there.
1014	This Movie Is Awful: It's cloying, overacted, unrealistic, maudlin, saccharine, and just abysmal. This one is a real stinker.
1015	Dissappointed: This is the third adapter that I bought and it was just as bad as the other two. It does not work and does not stay on the plug. Do not buy it.
1016	for idiots only: This is a good book if you have an extremely low IQ and need chapters and chapters on how to select which car model you want to buy. If that is your biggest problem when it comes to buying a car, then you are either very rich or very stupid. There are much better books around on how to deal with dealers, getting the most for your used car, not getting screwed on a lease, etc. The only adivce this book had on bargaining with dealers was "if you're not comfortabe with what's going on in the dealership, walk out." Sorry, but there's a lot more to negotiating than that.
1017	When is a DVD not a DVD?: Answer: When it does not contain any video clips, concert footage, commentary, or moving video content. For...the price of the CD, you get a mundane still photo of Natalie and/or friends pasted on your video screen while the song plays in the background.... that's it! How they have the nerve to market this as a DVD eludes my rational thought process...at least call it a DA(audio)D or something to distinguish it from something that actually has music video content. It's hard to believe that someone bought this before me without writing this review! Stay away from this one........
1018	scepter 5 gal can: Do what I did, save the can and throw away the spout. Use a funnel. This thing is not almost practically worthless, it's overpriced even if it DID have a working spout. But it was the only thing available at Home depot.
1019	Stupid and uninformative.: A lot of things wrong with this.First Not all states have teachers unions. They are illegal in Texas. Parents still complain about teachers. Bad Principals still complain that they can't fire teachers. And, yes our inner city school s don't perform well either.Blaming "bad" teachers is a crutch society and politicians are using to avoid systematic problems with their school system. Most school systems have problems that can't be solved in a "simple" fix.Ga ahead get rid of teacher's unions in your state too. Get rid of "tenure." Watch all your problems remain.This documentary never left the NE. They never stopped to understand the problem. They went straight to blaming "bad" teachers.
1020	Lame: This game isn't interactive at all. You're supposed to shoot at deer from a stationary point and pop off a bear or two so you don't "lose a turn". That's about it. It's arcade style so levels get progressively more hectic and insane, but it doesn't add excitement to the game.
1021	Disappointing: This is a fine product, except that it was unusable. The specs say that each strip is 1640mm. One of the strips was about 8 inches shorter than the other. Another reviewer stated a similar issue. If you buy this product, check out the length before you start wrapping. Each strip should be about 64 inches.
1022	A garden of many flowers: Mr. Gluck weaves us a tapestry of many and shifting tones. Offers us a city entered at dusk, or at dawn, and perhaps midnight. These stories together and apart speak to a rich internal life. One as comfortable with the sensual as the intellectual. As evocative of the moment as much as history. A book moving in many directions and in all directions moving. Thank you, Mr. Gluck.
1023	Mest- More than jaded.: The self titled 3rd album from mest is probably there best. With songs like "Rooftops" and "Walking on Broken Glass" there songs have definitly matured. With riffs from "Lost Broken Confused", "burning bridges" and "Paradise (122nd and highland)" they still know how to have fun. A little humor from Benji from Good Charlotte at the end was a surprise ending to there cd.
1024	Not happy with product: This meat grinder was not inspected very well if at all. There was extra material that hit the auger when you tried to use it, the handle had to be pounded on with a hammer because it was so tight. It ended up in the trash!!!
1025	author is bigot: Wild Justice has its' moments, but is very predictable. The author also seems to have an incredibly hateful view towards Italian-Americans.
1026	I bought this title for my 18 yr old son......: and he's been glued to since it arrived. It was recommended to him by a music business professor at Columbia College Chicago. I myself am not in the music business but if you are interested in this field or just starting out and want a better understanding of it, I don't think you can go wrong with this title.
1027	French & Saunders... tres magnifique!: For true lovers of British wit, French & Saunders are always the source of the real belly laugh... no canned laughter here masking inadequate writing and acting! This show fulfills all of one's comedic expectations, and if you can control your laughing you may just catch half of the jokes!
1028	Good: This unique album contains enything you want, except heavy and hard. Here we have drum'n base, jungle, jazz, ets. I can recommend it for all fans of electronics. Get this album and remember that it's a bargain. For example in Moscow I've seen this CD for 27 USD.
1029	Oster Stiff Brush A++ -- really lifts the dirt and easy to hold: This Oster stiff grooming brush really lifts the deep dirt and dust in my horse's coat. I am finding that my horses no longer puff up a cloud of dust when I pat them in the winter (when there is less grooming and NO bathing). I like it ten times better than my old, standard shaped wooden brushes. The ergonomically shaped, padded back makes it much easier to hold and to use. I have chronic tendonitis in my hands and this brush is great. Plus -- it WORKS!
1030	Evanescence: This album rocks beyond believe, From the hard rocking single " Bring me to life" to the sombre "my immortal" a good by and well worth your money
1031	Not So Happy: This baby book is tacky. I found it to be highly overated. This would not be a baby book that I would keep and pass on. When it says a book for Modern parents, that is exactly what it means, I guess I am not modern. If you are the least bit traditional, I sincerely doubt you will find this book funny or heartwarming. There are some funny pieces that would be great additions in a baby book, but overall I was so disappointed. Two baby showers to go to and I would not take this as a gift.
1032	PIONEER PD-F407 REVIEW: I really like this CD player,even without a remote.All I do is put it on,and hit the random button,and it's party time.It plays my CD's better than the CD player built into my stereo.And it mixes the songs up just right,some rock,then R&B,salsa,etc,etc.Bottom line...this is the perfect player for those who enjoy different types of music,and like to mix it up too.It's great for parties(I've hosted many,and all my guests love the music variety.)The price,for what you get,is an added bonus.Pioneer has always put out a great product,and once again,they do not dissapoint.This is one of the best purchases I've ever made,and i recommend this to all.
1033	Quantum Spirituality: A Journey of Personal Discovery: I believe this book is written at a level for which all can enjoy and understand. This book walks you through several exercises to enhance the teachings. You can personally relate and benefit from reading this book immediately. From the first chapter you are included and drawn into the author's teachings. I feel this book will help many people make the decision of a life time. Being complete and happy is the most important part of life and this book will help the reader do just that.
1034	Dog itching: I bought this as a suggestion from my vet to help my dog itching and it actually works pretty well, seems to be a great product for dogs too.
1035	its just a bunch of hippies screaming: this movie dosen't make any sense. i mean the story's messed up,and so is every thing else. its not scary because it never shows this so called "witch". it just shows people running away screaming. its not scary, completley stupid and low on special features. and if they were going to make this movie, use the actual film instead of sing another one. Horror fans might want to rent it.
1036	If some say its idiot proof then I'm an idiot: I have tried to use this strap clamp on multiple projects and have not had any success. It's either I don't have 8 hands to hold everything and tighten it at the same time or it is beyond my knowledge base to operate. About the only thing it was good for was a miter cut box top or picture frame, something that can rest flat and that the plastic corners can lay on the bench top and tighten evenly. If its even a little off the plastic corners slip off the corner by rolling over the top or under the bottom. It's like the moon and stars all have to align before I can get it to work as intended. I would not purchase this product again.Pat
1037	Great Movie: Loved the movie Men in Black 3...lots of action and a good story to go along with the action. The movie was actually better than I thought it would be.
1038	...: Yah i like this CD...Amy Lee's voice is awesome! I would kill for a voice like hers. My favorite songs are Going Under, Bring Me To Life, Everybody's Fool, My Immortal, Haunted, Tourniquet, Taking Over Me, and My Last Breathe...so yah...i basically love all of them! Buy a copy now! You won't regret it!!!
1039	STUPID PULL UP BAR: WARNING!! Do not buy this product!! I purchased this product a month ago. When I first got it, I was thrilled. I put it in my bedroom doorway, and it DESTROYED it. There are cracks on the doorway, and when I tighten the bar, the doorway expands with it. I then moved it to the storage doorway. It did the exact same damage to it. I was doing pull ups on it one time, and while I went up, the bar fell and now I broke my nose. Yes, it SAYS it supports people up to 250 lbs., I am 120 and every time you do a pull up, the bar slides down. You don't want to fasten the bar all the way, or it will WRECK your doorway, no joke. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!!
1040	easy to use: This product is extremely efficient and easy to use. It gets more hair than waxing, even baby fine ones. I was surprised at how little it hurt when I first started using it, but there are certain areas that hurt more than others. I had no problem with the bikini line, but around the bone in the front of my leg stung a little, and my knees were a little hard to navigate. In flabby thigh areas I recommend pulling the skin kind of taut because I experienced a "fat pinch" lol. I especially like it for the back of my thighs because the hair grows in so many different directions that shaving and waxing have been time consuming and not as effective. This product is great and leaves legs silky without a mess, and the stinging lessens as you get used to it. If your pain threshold is high or especially if you are already used to waxing, go ahead and try this and you can use it while you watch tv or something.
1041	Love it!!!: I bought this set a month ago from amazon.com and I've been using it everyday. I must stay it is the best cookware set I've ever owned. I really enjoy cooking with it, the clean up is VERY EASY, everything comes off right away, no scrubbing is needed! I wish I had bought 10 piece set... I highly recommend it!
1042	You can't RESIST this album: This is probably Big Mountains most complete album consisting of exceleent roots & culture music and simple yet sincere lyrics. If you are at all a fan of reggae music you will definitley enjoy Resistance.
1043	Leaves residue!: These silicone ice cub trays leave a waxy residue in your drinking glass! Makes you wonder how much of the "coating" sticks to your gut!
1044	Only thing that worked: I had a pest control company come back numerous times to no avail ... ants ants and more ants. I called another pest control company ... they wanted to charge $400 ... just for the ants. I bought this, they swarmed around it for a couple days, took it back to their leader and then no more ants since!!!!
1045	So cute: I really enjoyed this book. I paid very little for this and that makes it even better. Enjoy! :) :)
1046	Review of "Mere Christianity": Perhaps I'm confused, but by Book II: Part 3 'The Shocking Alternative', it seems to me that with the sentence "God created things which had free will", C.S. Lewis had decided that the concept of "god" is a given, and the Christian view that "this is a good world that has gone wrong, but still retains the memory of what it ought to have been" becomes the basis upon which the remained of the book is built.Maybe I misunderstood, but it is at this point he lost my interest. I thought I would be reading objective intellectial text, I am mistaken.
1047	Christmas Present: I purchased this as a present for one of my sons. He had requested this version rather than the newer versions. He feels it is a better made and acted film.
1048	All that I hoped for: For a difficult language to learn, this beginning course based on the Yale University curriculum is designed only for those who seriously want to practice the grammar and vocab of the language for proficiency. The program does not lend itself to laziness, but for those interested in well designed audio drills with a fast-paced college textbook, this would be a good choice.
1049	Really?: Really expected much more than women don't always work nice with women. There were no in depth stories, no solutions....It wasn't nearly as helpful as I had hoped.
1050	it is alright: I am not a Brandy fan but, I am not goin to bad mouth her. I think you should but Monica's album instead. This is alright but, it is not as real life and meaningful as Monica's CD. But it was not as bad as I thought it would be. Bye it if you want.
1051	Great bag!: i love the structure of the bag: the shoes compartment which has an internal sack that separates it from other articles inside the bag, the beverage pocket, the cd player pocket, and the cellphone pocket. the handle and strap are very sturdy. + the hard board lining on the bottom is an awesome touch.however, i gave only 4 stars because its shipping cost is too much for just a small bag and also because they used FedEx.FedEx... need i say more?ok, then; FedEx has lost, couldn't find my addressES, and had been late at delivery in every occasion. well, for me at least. i despise FedEx.that's why i appreciate Amazon using UPS.
1052	Great Sticker, wish they came in bigger packs: This packing slip envelope really sticks well. One of the best we have used. Would buy again. Wish it came in bigger packs however :(
1053	Over Rated: I would suggest this book only for hard core military fans. I was shocked by how boring I found this book after I read all the glowing reviews on this site. It is not a terrible book but two stars is being very generous in my opinion. The action didn't even start until about 350 pages in and I think the book was way too long. I don't see myself purchasing another book by Elizabeth Moon.
1054	Christian fascism takes over U.S. ...sound familiar?: I love Octavia Butler's daring,caring and strong people who transform her bleak scenarios into hopeful tales of human potential. The theme of the unresolved oppression that continues to breed slavery is never far from her mind or pen. This book is striking to read because although Butler published it in the late 1990s, the danger of future of a U.S. run by Christian fascists led from the White House seems more more real than ever.For a factual recent history of Christian theocrats in the U.S. read Esther Kaplan's recent book With God on Their Side, and for a trenchant analysis of the philosophy and social base behind this madness read Avakian's Preaching From a Pulpit of Bones, another prescient work from the 1990s.
1055	cured my psoriasis: I had psoriasis on my ankles and feet- got to the point where it was painful to walk or stand- put this on under some sox in the morning and before bed- was gone within a couple of weeks. Only have to use it 2x a week now to maintain. also great for toning skin on stomach, thighs, etc straight out of the shower.This stuff is amazing and as natural as you can get!
1056	Nice Christmas songs: This is great baby song album. I love Fred Mollin's music. His music never make you bored. You will love this.
1057	crazed baboon stalks colligete d&d players in science dept.: Roddy mcdowell is the game master to easy living d&d live role players who unwitting discover that the a hybrid baboon science project wishes them all dead. Perfect stuff for that saturday day afternoon, leave your brain behind and just watch the film fun.
1058	Enchanting: A lovely story of a troubled town and a motivated man in search of the answers from his past. The end of a legacy and the beginning of a freed way of life. great for a leasurely read but impossible to put down.
1059	Didn't Work as Expected: Purchased this item on high reviews. We tried it in our auditorioum. Needed to work for 70'-75' from the computer. Advertised to work to 100'. Wouldn't work consistantly to past 20' from computer. Worked very sporadically at distances past 20' and often double clicked through slides on powerpoint presentation. Would loved to have had it work but it didn't. Returned it to get a Targus model that we've tested and works fine.
1060	Sooo bad, it unwatchable: This could have been a good series, but the acting is just dreadful. In particular the actor who plays Arthur is really terrible. The writing isn't much better. I like the costumes and the sets, but I can only spend so long looking at those...
1061	From good to the kick@$$ album: This album not only made history by bringing Heavy Metal back from the dead but also by making number one on the charts for more then a year and a half.If you listen to their old stuff,it's fast with good rythems and Leads.Then the black album makes a great soundtrack for everyday life.
1062	Another great Thomas Newman score: It is always nice when a film releases a score-only-cd. I was disapointed when I saw the soundtrack out and only two of Newmans'tracks were listed. Other great Newman titles are How to Make an American Quilt, The War and Fried Green Tomatoes(the score album.
1063	DOA - never functions: My unit was DOA and never functioned so no review of performance. I have purchased FR products from Amazon before and was generally satisfied. This one was not.
1064	Worked well until it broke!: I (Timothy's wife) used this pump for occasional relief of engorgement, but it fell apart after only a few uses. The part that connects the handle to the pump snapped, making it unusable. Definitely a disappointment, since I was gentle with it, used it properly, and it fell apart during a routine assembly after washing. I would like another like this, but can't bring myself to buy a second like this to replace one that should not have broken after only a couple of uses.
1065	Cuisinart DCG-12BC Stopped working after 4 uses: I received this grinder for Christmas and unfortunately threw away the packaging. The grinder worked great for the first 4 times and then it just quit. I thought maybe the bowl wasn't secured or the blade had come loose. Don't waste your money on this product and I thought Cuisinart was a good product. If you do, save receipts and boxes for at least a month.
1066	They work great!: These are just what I was looking for. Not too thin, not too thick. Great color selection. Great quality. They seem as though they will last a while.
1067	Great for intermediate guitarists: I've checked out a number of online/DVD courses etc and this is by far the best. The material is straightforward, concise. Most importantly all of the lessons are very useful and I experienced rapid improvement in my guitar playing. The book is a great companion to the video material and in my opinion, essential to get the most out of the DVD courses.
1068	Raised folds in three, interferes with playing: This table folds in three, and the folds aren't clean so if the ping pong ball landed on it, it would skew. Also arrived with alot of scratched on it. I returned it.
1069	I have to agree with Kansas!: I was also searching for "replacement" pieces. Registered for this pattern as our everyday flatware 15 years ago to compliment our Desert Rose dinnerware. Our family has grown and we need to add additional pieces.We too have used these for floor scrapers, gum removers, locked door openers, fisher for lost items under the refrigerator, scuff mark remover, screwdriver, etc., etc., etc.! Yes, we do eat with them, too! With 15 years of use, they still look like new. This is the most durable flatware if you choose to use it for everyday.It is beautiful and very comfortable to hold. I am constantly comparing it to any other design I hold in my hand.You will LOVE this pattern for formal or everyday dinnerware!
1070	Great Invention!!: Argued with myself over this machine whether it would be practical or not. Let me tell you that it is the most practcal coffee machine I ever owned. Now that I am the only coffee drinker in the house it is perfect for me. I was always throwing coffee out or, even worse, microwaving to heat it. YUK! Now I have fresh coffe every morning, I can have my choice of coffee flavors, or strengths and it is always fresh. Don't waste another minute! Order one today!
1071	MS Money 2002 is still better: I will not upgrade from 2002 version, even though invoices are not very customisabe. The only problem 2002 had was you could not save your invoice design for use, if you need to reinstal. And it does not seem that it is fixed in this version. So I will not purchase this product this year. I may even switch to Quicken.
1072	Very nice translation of the Ripper lore: I was surprised to hear the Hughes Bro. were doing this film, their previous outings being urban crime storis about life in the ghetto (Dead Presidents and Menace II Society), but this movie was a masterstroke. Although the MPAA forced the directors to go easy on the gory details of the Ripper's killings, the facts are here, more or less intact, and most of the major theories are represented as well Johnny Depp is excellent and, surprisingly, Heather Grahahm is also very strong, this being her first period piece.The movie has a laconic, dreamy feeling, and is pretty intoxicating. The movie isn't as scary as it could probably be, but there are many ghastly, gruesome moments that had the audience flinching, I recommend it highly, especially on the big screen when all the beautiful cinematography and direction show through.
1073	Too bad this has anytjing at all to do with "The Bodyguard": It's a pity this alleged masterpiece of an album will be forever linked with a shlocky film that nobody remembers. Soundtracks are a bad idea.
1074	Get this DVD: iCarly is one of the best shows for young tweens today. This DVD has some of the first episodes of the show on there. The episodes are:Disc 1:I Pilot 4.5 StarsI want more Viewers 5 StarsI Hatch Chicks 5 StarsI Dream Of Dance 4 StarsI Like Jake 4 StarsI Wanna Stay W Spencer 5 StarsI Nevel 4 StarsDisc 2:I Scream on Halloween 4.5 StarsI Spy on a Mean Teacher 5 StarsI Want To Date Freddie 4 StarsI want a World Record 4 StarsI Rue The Day 4.5 StarsI Promise Not To Tell 5 Stars
1075	Very Cute: Read this aloud to my children who were delighted with it. Styled very much like a Beatrix Potter the characters are animals. They are a family that like each other and have fun as well as work. Only sad thing was it seemed to have an abrupt end. My children were looking forward to more. :)
1076	Unreliable: The Math sections contain mistakes; this makes one waste time during practice tests. Some of the passages in the Reading Comprehension sections are missing some paragraphs (which can be found in the CD-ROM version.) The explanations for the answers are far from convincing. Generally, the book does not inspire confidence at all. Don't buy it.
1077	Confusing and boring: Comparing this book with other thrillers, I think it's not the Casablanca of this century but rather the most confusing book I have ever read. A very good introduction but too many characters lost the plot and thus as a result the reader may find the book boring just like I felt. I've just finished reading Home Run by Gerald Seymour and I really enjoyed the latter. It's about international terro. as well but it's simpler and much more entertaining. Hope that not too many authors copy the style of this book.
1078	A disappointment!: Roth's latest book is based on a clever and interesting idea. However several things contribute to my disappointment with this novel. Philip Roth intrudes into the novel by being the principal character...Philip as a small boy growing up in Newark and his family ...and this device adds nothing and includes a lot of information which is, frankly, boring!Secondly, the plot is totally unbelievable..not because Fascism couldn't happen here, but because the plot line and writing aresimply not convincing.
1079	not a happy guy: I feel like I was ripped off by amazon.I placed an order for the kindle on thurs at 10:30 pm,I then called my friend to bragg about it.He told me that there was a new kindle comming out around feb.I checked on the net and it does look like they will release a new one soon.So at 10:40 pm I went to my acc and wanted to stop the order,but for the 1st time since I have ordered from amazon i was not able to stop it.It said that the order was already to ship.I called amazon and was told that there was nothing they can do,told me when I get the package just to refuse it and I would get a refund.But not for the s/h.Like I said I have ordered from amazon many times and even when I picked next day delivery I still had about 3 or 4 hours to change or stop the order.I feel like Amazon is trying to get rid of the kindles that they have now to make room for the kindle 3 that is coming out soon.I am very shocked that amazon is doing this.
1080	Air - 10,000 Hz Legend: 10,000 Hz Legendisn't as bad as many people would have you believe. It's definitely a change in direction for the French duo. That said, it's not that great either. Tracks like "Radian" manage to salvage the album as a whole, but others, like "Wonder Milky Bitch" are just awful.
1081	movies on time: The movies get to me the same day they hit the stores and I dont have to drive to get them.
1082	Great weathervane: We have been looking for some time for a weathervane for our shed. There are a lot of very expensive ones out there and we were hesitant to spend $200 on one that we did not see in person. We purchased the rooster roof mounted weathervane from Cedar Plantation Co. for a quarter of the price (approx. $60 w/ shipping) of other expensive ones that we were looking at and we were pleasantly surprised-- it's great. It's the perfect size, color and is heavy and durable-- it will definitely provide us with many years of use.The Cedar Plantation Company was great providing quick answers to our questions and we received the weathervane the day after we received the email from Amazon that it had shipped.Overall, if you couldn't tell, I'm very pleased with the weathervane and Cedar Plantation Company's customer service.
1083	Wrst Steven Seagal movie, ever!: "Against The Dark is hands down the worst of Steven Seagal's movies and he has had some bad one's. If I were him, I would be ashamed to have my name associated with this movie. It doesn't have a sensible plot, is poorly acted by all and is the most boring movie I have ever seen.
1084	Avoid these fans: Installed the Talismoon fans in a Jasper unit. They do not quite fit properly and the blades can hit the air shroud when it is screwed down tightly.Talismoon claims that these fans push more air, but measurement via internal sensors revealed that the actual cooling performance is extremely poor. Idle temps immediately rose +15C above the stock fans and kept climbing, despite the auto fan speed raising them to a very noisy level.Avoid these fans. If you're hoping to replace buzzing/whining fans, I recommend OEM Nidec fans (all black, no text) if you can find them.
1085	Bad copy: I'm a chemistry major and I use these notebooks quite a bit. I've always used the orange "official laboratory research notebook" but I wanted to try this brand out. The carbon copy sucks. I tried using a thin-point pen, I tried pressing harder against it when I write but the copy is still barely visible. After 7 pages plus the carbon copy I decided to go back to the orange notebook. It is way better.
1086	American Monster: In his preface, the author quotes his wife as saying, "Don't ramble-get to the point." Semonin never takes her advice and thus this is a book that should have been no more than half as long as this disjointed collection of digressions. There are really several stories in this book. I wish the author had decided which one he wanted to tell. Semonin can be an engaging storyteller and the discovery of fossil mastodon bones in North America came at a formative stage in American history. Too bad the author didn't find an editor who was willing to make him take his wife's advice.
1087	Poorly Constructed: I bought this product only a week ago. I was impressed with it's high quality recording capabilities, but not its craftsmanship. I had the Edirol R-09 in a protective case and dropped it barely 2 feet from the ground. As I examined the product, the side had completely busted open. The "on" button was moved and the rubber had completely separated. As I tried to repair it, more and more plastic pieces started coming off. I was so disappointed how poorly this product was constructed. If you choose to buy this product buy a heavy duty case immediately or just beware that it's not durable.
1088	Steel On Target: You know a man's qualities by his enemies. I note that the negative reviews of this book are just leftie rants--and I can't believe any of the detractors actually read it. Frankly, I'm not sure you can classify Peters as liberal or conservative. But I'd class him as one great American.This book is right on target, based upon my own experience. No bull, no blather, no boredom. Straight talk about the difficult world in which we find ourselves.There's a lot of great, thought-provoking stuff in this book--my own favorite section is a brilliant reinterpretation of the strategic environment, but the pieces on Operation Iraqi Freedom are super--all through the war, he called it right. And I believe he's calling the future right, as well.Read it and decide for yourself. Great work for America!
1089	Nearly worthless: I had a Samsung 8200 and used the Data Pilot software to back up my contacts to transfer them to my new Google G1 phone.Suffice it to say, their data transfer capabilities are worthless. You have the capacity to export your address book to windows Outlook or Apple's Iphone.Excuse me, but the world does not revolve around Apple or MicroShaft. A simple method to export to CSV format would be VERY helpful. Of course, Google doesn't read MS WAB (address book) format, and the outlook export to CSV simply doesn't work well.Find other ways to sync your phone and your PC.
1090	Good book, bad publication: Love the series, but this particular e-book has many editing mistakes. For instance, there were 3 missing letters in words within a 2 chapter span. It makes you wonder if anyone even proofread it.Again, the book itself is great.
1091	Awesome!!: Received Item as advertised nice watch to be honest. Love the design and the overall look and shipping was fast A+++++
1092	Skip this installment of WoT: This installment of WoT was totally forgettable. In fact, I may have read this book twice without any hint of recollection. I think fans of this series can safely skip this book without any loss of continuity. If you absolutely need to read it for yourself then simply skip to the last chapters featuring Perrin, Mat, and Egwene. These three chapters contain ALL of the plot developments. As for the rest of the chapters:* Elayne and Rand do nothing.* There are no battles.* Nothing important happens to any major characters.The good news is that an editor/author will make a truly great work some day by producing an abridged/plagiarized version of this story. Just three volumes, 1500 pages, and non-stop action. This will be the fantasy classic that will be read by generations to come. Too bad Jordan/TOR let go of the reins and allowed greed to run rampant over an extremely promising storyline.
1093	not what i thought: this was a let down. I bought this item to go with my sons geo trax train sets and once i got it found out it only holds the old style remotes and the new ones are too big. Now the description does say something about sounds from the old remotes but I did not realize the new ones were too big so we cannot use it....
1094	Definently Worth The Wait: let me start by saying that chevelle is an amazing band. I was deeply in love with Wonder Whats Next, Point # 1 was alright. I knew it was gonna be hard to beat w.w.n. but they came damn near close. This album is very strong, but the drum sound is bad, it love Sam and he is a great drummer but the recorded druming wasnt that gppd, you cant even hear his amazing double bass too well. any ways im out but if you loved wwn then this album is a definite good buy for your 15 bucks
1095	good choice: for the money, this product offers good sound quality, and exceptionally "good fit" on one's head; it's a "best buy" for most. a pocket-sized mp3 and/or mp4 player with average/typical power supply will drive these headphones, instead of "ear buds," for 6 to 8 hours, non-stop. but ppl might wonder why....~dave
1096	Martha's Magic cd: I play this CD EVERY night for my three daughters who share a room. It's become part of the bedtime ritual and I enjoy it too. I'll have to get another copy for my 13 month old sons room! My favorite is the rendition of the Beatles "Blackbird".Enjoy!
1097	Good Show, Poor Release: Episodes are out of order, there are no language or subtitle options.If you must have everything Code Lyoko, go ahead. If you are a casual fan or insist on perfection, don't bother.
1098	You won't be disappointed!: If you have read her other books from the series(And I suggest you do),you defintely won't be disappointed. It's funny, clever, charming, great story, what else can you ask for? I'm certain you will love it!
1099	Does not work with MAC OS X 10.5 Leopard: It does not work on with MAC OS X 10.5 The network connection is extremely slow, you cannot use time machine and you get no help whatsoever from LaCie support on this.Don't buy it, waste of money.
1100	Too Much Is Missing From The Choppers: Although The Choppers does look great, it's unbelievably missing nearly ten minutes of footage. The first cut scene brings up the stakeout plan and the last has Arch Hall Jr. singing "Monkeys In My Hatband" (which another reviewer mentioned.) The longest takes place at the Chick-A-Dilly with Marianna Gaba playing detective while enticing the gang in order to find out the owner of the hotrod the police are after. It's her best scene where she does more than just look sensational. The Choppers is entertaining and would have been even better without these cuts. Cutting ten minutes out of a movie that ran only 66 to begin withmakes absolutely no sense to me. A couple of other versions are available, but I don't know if they are complete or not.
1101	Waste of Money: Had for less than one year and now it won't power up; flashes on and shuts immediately off. May be a coincidence, but didn't have problems powering up until after I played it with its battery power. Tried to play with and without batteries since, but it isn't working.
1102	Good space saver: I bought this because like most parents, our toddler took over the living room. This is fantastic for all the little toys that get lost at the bottom of a big toy box. When I put this together (super easy) and put her toys in it, my two year old thought they were all new! She is loving it. I am loving it because its teaching her that her toys have their own place (all baby doll items go in one bin, all stacking cups in another, etc). From a quality standpoint, it is worth the money and the colors work for a girl or boy. I also like that it easily fits up against any wall so later it can even be moved to her bedroom closet (if I'm lucky).
1103	All you could ask for: Although its getting a little old, the advice Bernstein lays out in his book is all useful and keeps you thinking. "Day Trading Stocks" is one of the few books that gives clears entry and exit systems with no fluff or filler.
1104	Not sure why these guys aren't world famous: I never would have heard of Grasshopper Takeover if I didn't happen to pick up a demo EP from a used CD store, but GTO deserves much recognition. They slam with all the talent of any given super-band, and sing with the purest emotion you'll ever hear. Distinctive vocals, honest and inspired lyrics, and much variety ranging from punk to alternative to good ol' rock n' roll earn GTO the rank of possibly the most worthwhile band I've ever heard.
1105	Overall a good read: Now this book starts off great and I loved how real it felt the whole time I was reading it. It does however become quite boring in the end with all the talk of strategies and the winding down of the story. But as I indicated in the title it is an overall good read.
1106	Almost unwatchable: This movie was bad. It was so bad that it made the good actors in it look bad by proxy. The plot was simplistic, dull and forced. The suspense was found in spots that must have read on the script as "(Insert suspense here)". Denzel Washington acted like Denzel washington acting as a cop. The tired 'foil' detective they tried to use as a red herring was so obvious it was painful to watch. The identity of the serial killer was so pathetic that it made me throw stuff at my TV. The clues left behind by the killer weren't all that subtle, I've seen smarter clues in Encyclopedia Brown mysteries. It's a boring predictable hollywood hack job. bad bad bad. Don't waste your money.
1107	Great product at a great price!: You can't go wrong in buying this cable. It works great. I have it connected to my 32" LCD to my XBOX 360 and it looks awesome. The cable that came looks different from the picture but as long as it works, I'm not complaining. It actually looks better than the one in the pic anyway.
1108	not a quality product: i got 2 units from netgear and i was unable to get either of them working. the first one wouldnt power up correctly and the second one would not work for more than an hour at the most.i have been unable to get this router working correctly for more than an hour. the router fails after an hour. an immediate re-start of the router or resetting did not help. for some reason, if i wait for about 2-3 hours before i power it back on, i can get it to work again.the web interface is easy enough to use and all, but if the base product doesnt work well .....
1109	There's no crime against feel-good music: I don't exactly understand why certain critics choose to be harsh on the bubbly, energetic music of B*witched. The Irish quartet makes music that feels good and is fun to listen to. And, after years of angst-ridden "deep" music from the likes of Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the Teen pop revolution, of which B*witched is its newest prodigy, is a welcome change.
1110	One to ponder: The author manages to evoke gut wrenching emotions she tellsthe tale of a young Alaskan woman,Kate, who seems to attract ill fortune wherever she goes.Filled with baited suspense, a hint of humour, some actionand a touch of romance, Dana has you "eating out of her hand" beforelong.
1111	Well executed so pay attention.: Memento is well executed because despite what appears to be disjointed and confusing scenes quickly ties into congruent segments to form a comprehensible whole. Perhaps it is not wholly unique but nonetheless... (Where am I? I'm at a computer. Whats on the screen? That looks like my writing.) it is a brilliant film. Unforgettable.
1112	Six bees torn apart within four hours!: We purchased the hive and three bee toys six months ago for our two miniature poodles. They love the toy and the bees lasted almost six months before I reordered two sets (of three each) of replacement bees. The first set of replacement bees lasted less than four hours. Our two poodles managed to rip each of the bees apart, removed the stuffing, and began munching on the plastic squeakers. The second set of replacement bees didn't last any longer. I would be very cautious about providing these bees to any dog unless the retailer can assure that ours was a bad lot or that they have replaced their supplier.
1113	Nothing like the movie: Usually the books are better than the movie, but this is not the case with this book. Forrest was a sweet ignorant boy in the movie, but in the book he is like a trashy redneck stupid boy!
1114	wack-o: This book was a well-intended gift to me from a fellow relaxing-bath enjoyer. I didn't realize it would contain very subjective material that is actually not at all useful to me. I had a hard time even relating to this book, being from a scientific background though I try to keep an open mind. I would not recommend it to anyone--it seemed to me essentially hocus-pocus.
1115	Broke before it ever got used: The very first time I tried to use this, it ripped. One of the pigs feet came off and the fabric ripped on the other. I wasn't expecting it to last forever, but kind of thought I might get to use it at least once. Its funny, but a piece of junk none the less.
1116	Quality metal & a good deal, not sure about handles: I purchased two of these pots over 2 years for homebrewing, and they're some of the best values I've gotten through Amazon. The quality and weight of the stainless really impressed me for the price. I can say that both have done well with brewing chemicals like PBW and StarSan, so the Stainless is not some cheap coating.The original has riveted handles, and I've used it for multiple brews with 6-7 gallons of wort - never filled up to handles to know if rivets leak like some reviewers note.The new pot has step-welded handles, and I'm leery to use it as frequently because they don't look as secure to me ... but I'm not a good judge of welding. Time will tell if they hold up. But if you're looking for a cheap pot for 5-6 gallon batches of beer, it's hard to beat this one.
1117	book: she loves the recipes, very kool book at a good price. used it to make her first taramisu cake and it was the bomb!
1118	Beach boys: I think the audio here is really bad. Now it maybe simply my playback system in the car;but these guys are much better than this disc suggests
1119	Confusing?: I can not understand this writing, It is almost like someonedecided to write a book, from a dream or a nightmare.Only got to the 6th Chapter, and going to call it quits.Wasted enough of my time.This is some of the worst writing I have ever read
1120	Inept Mellencamp Mangles the Blues: Why the hell would anyone listen to Mellencamp's sorry attempt to sing "Stones in My Passway" when they can listen to Robert Johnson? Or to Son House, or Howlin' Wolf or any of the other blues aces whose songs are horribly mangled by this inept Hoosier. A slap in the face to the real blues and a pitiful attempt to cash in on the roots music craze.
1121	Birds on the bat: This is a must have for redbird fans. I've seen some nit picking by others but for a roundup of the 2011 playoffs it fits the bill.
1122	GARAGE DOOR REMOTE: Simple to install. Simple to use! Not a moment's regret! Sorry we didn't purchase this sooner after losing one of our remotes. The price was unbeatable, too!
1123	This book is no Phillipa Gregory that is for sure.: This read was a real disappointment. Very little research went into this. book. A great deal of sappy conjecture. Sappy Sappy!
1124	Every Cliche and Formula Out There: As another reviewer wrote, 'Been there, read that.'And with more originality, style, you name it.Pass on this one. I couldn't even make it to the halfway point before I threw the book in the trash.
1125	If you want everyone to hate you....read this book!: If you don't care about anything else in the world but money and getting to the top then read this book. If you don't need friends, co-workers, your family or any of your pets to like you, then this is the book for you.I bought this book under the pretense that this book was a self-help "how to empower yourself" type of book. Ya know like a Dyanetics type of book. Boy was I wrong. This book is a one way ticket to "I'm an Azzholeville." The book gives more tips on how to get to the top by stepping on people then the Dallas Cowboys cheerleader pyramid.Why would anyone want to live their life being so manipulative? Its like a full time job of back stabbing. Eventually people will become hip to your game and isolate you. So if you read this book and take the advice, I hope you like eating tv dinners alone on holidays.
1126	A solid router: Over all this router works very well. I dont really know much about routers and from what i saw online this was a very well rated router. We use this router for a PC and a Mac and it works with both very well. The set up was very easy except I couldnt get the CD to work on the Mac. I dont notice normal web surfing being any faster but I have noticed that it improved video streaming. Downloading videos from you tube works great. All in all I would say it is a good router and worth buying, but it might be a little over priced.
1127	too small sink: very small no dimensions available when ordering. felt decieved, was not what i expected in regards to size would not purchase again
1128	Did Not Stay Up: Very pretty and comfortable, but did not stay up at all. I ended the evening barelegged.
1129	Cheap/ Bad Quality Hat: We purchased this as a gift and should have known better by the pricing. You get what you pay for.this is more of a costume..throw-away hat. the brim was crooked and cheap cardboard like material..and the cotton is VERY cheap.If you're looking for a throw-away...or costume hat, then this is fine. If you are looking for a decent quality captain's hat, then keep looking.
1130	Predictable to say the least!!: This movie is absolutely nothing. It left nothing to the imagination. Not only that, this movie isn't scary, nor is it horror, it is nothing more than a bland suspense thriller at best. A suspense thriller with very little thrills or chills, and certainly nothing that would leave you on the edge of your seat. Truthfully, they left a lot of holes in the story. I wished they would've explained to me why, or what motive, these men had for doing these things to these people. With that said, eveything else was just more of the same. In fact, anyone who has seen their fair share of suspense thrillers could've figured out the plot and about her cellmate early on in the film just as I did. My sypnosis is that you rent this movie if you have nothing else better to do for about an hour and a half, but please DON'T! buy this because you'll have wasted your money if you do.
1131	poorly written introduction to music: While the content of this book is appropriate, the text is sometimes misleading, confusing and vague.I do not recommend this book. Edly's is much better.
1132	Great Read: Great s start to John Rain series. Most books start fast and then get very predictable, not this one. Easler has a great series.
1133	Dull & Monotonous: Okay, I am a Woodiwiss fan just like the next reader. However with this book, I think the villain is a "unbelievable" and an "ineffective" character. Its too bad this story is not a hot one that you can really sink your teeth into because Woodiwiss is a wonderful writer and I think her fans expect her novels to be a good read. Which comes to mind that I started reading this book way back in January of '02 and I still have not finished it because of its lack of depth. Meanwhile during this time, I've read close to 60 other books from cover to cover and this one is by far the dullest one I have ever read.
1134	great shoes!: These shoes are so cute! I should've gotten a half size larger but they still fit ok. They are definately a good price for what you get.
1135	Lithium Battery and Taylor Scales: The bathroom scales worked fine, they even traveled well, the problem came when I needed to replace the lithium battery...I have been trying to find one in a rather large city and can't come up with one so I am having to replace the scales. What a waste!!!
1136	good at first...then broken irrepairable: We got this as a gift and used for about one year. It was very clear with no static...then the monitor just kept on dying for no reason. When it was plugged in, when it was using the rechargable batteries---fisher price did nothing to help stating that the monitor was out of warranty. One would think one could get more than a year's worth of use from a monitor. Don't buy it or one like it.
1137	much to love about Cobain's charming crudities and rawness: A thoroughly rockin' album I have listened to over and over. But they severely lost credibility in my book when I found out "Come As You Are" ripped off Killing Joke's "Eighties." Ripping off other peoples' music is inexecusibly sleezy. "Come As You Are" was key to propelling Nirvana into the realm of fame and fortune and it was nothing but a lie. For shame! I'll still listen and love it though. Shame on me!
1138	What A Waste Of Film!: "Left Behind" may be the single worst waste of celluloid in the history of motion pictures. Presented as "family entertainment," it is nothing but a crude and ham-handed propaganda flick promoting the most egregious absurdities of the fundamentalist right-wing religious fanatics."Left Behind" has something for everyone -- false piety for evangelicals; roaring action scenes for teenaged boys; proselytizing thinly disguised as plot; and, of course, Jesus in the starring role (one wonders how big a percentage the Savior's agent got.)The only thing "Left Behind" is good for is to prop up the leg of a wobbly table. This piece of cinematic garbage will be entertaining only to those sad people whose real lives are so pathetic that they must hope for something better in the next.
1139	Become Bedazzled: Wow, besides being a fun movie with a great cast and story, for anyone from Orange County California, think THE IRVINE FAMILY RANCH....It will give you a whole new story to think about. Would love to know if anyone else sees the similarities....
1140	too soon for review: I ordered the Canon fax and am using the cartridge which came with it so I can't yet review this product. Iwas very pleased with you system. The transaction was very easy.
1141	What a waste: Why did Mr. Haldeman write this book? The only reason I can figure is that his last sorry book, "Forever Peace" won some awards so he thought he could make some money by revisiting his best work. Well I wish he could give me my money back. Forever Free is AWFUL. This is what we waited for? The ending of Forever War was so perfect, leaving the lives of the two characters up to the readers imagination. I think anyones imagination could have devised a better ending than the one written here by Haldeman. A 25 year wait just so that Mr. Haldeman can completely destroy this story line with what? Just a bad episode of "The twilight Zone." This story is just plain bad, no action, no suspense, none of the caring for the characters that I felt in the first book. I fought off the urge to just throw it away half way through the book, hoping for a payoff in the end...it didn't come. Cant steer folks away from this piece of garbage enough.
1142	Rock Bottom: I've loved Steely Dan since the early days and was excited about this new release. Unfortunately, they've taken the worst qualities from Two Against Nature and stretched them out for the entire album. TAN had it's moments but suffered from a thin, dry recording mix and mechanical arrangements.It's ironic that a band known for it's high quality recordings would put out an album lacking any bottom end. The highs are crystal clear but the mix is not anchored with any depth from the bass and drums.More importantly, the material on this album lacks the edge that made old Steely Dan so great. Their classic albums always maintained a balance between jazz sophistication and raw rock energy. EMG sounds like easy listening radio music from beginning to end. None of the tunes lodge in the brain for longer than a few minutes. Very disappointing.
1143	Nice fit!!!: This is a very good looking jean!!! It's not as thick as expected, but looks greats not too slim not baggy at all!!! I'll buy in diffirent colors. Let's see if they are durable
1144	Mystery, Even Deceptive Publication Date: The sub-title of this work is "Third Edition," which apparently came out in 1997, based on the date of the "Preface to the Third Edition" but its publication date is given as 2003. Since things have changed a great deal in the patent arena since 1997, this book is far less useful than would be one actually revised and republished in 2003. I'm returning this book and demanding a full refund.
1145	A Must Have: I got Pulse when I was 11 years old, and ever since then I have been a huge Pink Floyd fan. I love their music when they had Sid Barret, then when they had David Gilmore, and I even like thir music after Waters left. Pulse males the listener feel like he is in the crowd and makes you wish that the band would tour again. I get goose bumps every time I listen to the crowd sing a long to "Wish You Were Here". This is a definate must have.
1146	Not for shaving: Great deal pricewise, but i took this item to get sharpened by a professional, and was still not able to get it sharp eneough to shave with. 10.00 worth of steel, it is a good novelty item or if you want to have something flashy to cut some string. Stropped and honed BY a professional... cant shave the hair of my chinny chin chin. DONT BUY IT TO SHAVE! I would have sent it back, but 10 bucks is a lesson, to do research before you buy.
1147	too scary: I recently watched this video and found it disurbing andrealistic. It truly has a cold war feeling about it. I think this isone Dr. Suess story that parents should watch with the children if not alone.
1148	Waterpik Ultra: An excellent product that really cleans well between the teeth, since it has more water pressure and faster pulsation to dislodge trapped food between the teeth and plaque along the gum line.
1149	Gentle Prenatal: I just tried my Just Once prenatal vitamins and am happy to say that unlike the prenatal vitamins I've had in the past, these do not make me sick. Perhaps its that these are a natural, food based supplement or perhaps they don't contain such high doses of many vitamins but these are easy to take (yes, a tad big but I've had bigger) and they smell kinda green and earthy, not pungent like other prenatals. Most importantly, they do not make me feel queezy so big plus there. Happy I found these and they are available in most drug stores.
1150	A broken calendar?!?: I've been off all week and I couldn't figure out why. Well, that's because this calendar has a typographical error in March. The 18th is input twice which messed up the rest of March for me. Although the makers "redeemed" themselves by making March a 30 day month as opposed to a 31 day month. Sure it's only one month that's messed up (so far, I haven't checked the rest) but c'mon, who makes typos on calendars?!
1151	My son's favorite: My son loves his Pupsqueak. He loves the bright colors and how his ears crinkle. It certainly keeps him entertained and I never leave the house without it.
1152	Good price but not ready to use: I am sure it is a good product. I like to listen to the police and fire calls. Now if I could just find someone to set it up so I can use it.I have read the book and tried to follow the directions. At this time I am very frustrated and disappointed. Spend my money and time but have nothing I can get any use out of. Maybe some day I can find someone to set the radio up.
1153	As expected: Not much to say other than it fit and looks fine. I bought it to go with the Honeywell Aube programmable timer switch I ordered for home security purposes.
1154	I hope I never have to use it!: I purchased the Giro as piece of mind when I am out riding on the back country roads. It is lite weight, fits easily, and keeps your head fairly cool on a hot day with the air holes. It looks good when you are wearing it. I just hope it never comes in use.
1155	Lowepro CompuTrekker AW: Lowe advertized that the unit would hold a 17" Laptop. It did not and was returned.
1156	The best DeMille yet: I have not read too many books that I consider real "page turners" but this one is. I truly had a hard time putting it down. I wish he could write them as quickly as I can read them!
1157	Thank You!: I've been doing readings since childhood and I have read almost every book on the subject. But her books are my favorites hands down. I enjoyed every page of this book. I consider it my psychic bootcamp( in a good way). She connects with the reader and you find yourself jumping right into her well developed lessons.Thanks
1158	Music to fall in love with: I'm going to buy this CD because her new one, "Eclipse" is fantastic. I bought it in B.A. but no one in the U.S. carries it yet, not even amazon.com
1159	LSD: I have read alot of kings books he puts alot into the start and the middle but alot of times the end is just bad the only thing i can say about this book is how muchLSD did king take?
1160	Cheap Junk: What has happened to Levi's? Very thin material, have had several rip on the seam of the back pocket in less than 6 months. Even before they ripped, when I went outside on a cold day, it seemed to offer no warmth in the back end, like it had already ripped, but it had not yet. Not much luck with Wrangler either. I guess if you want good jeans nowadays, you have to pay up bigtime. These are not even close to acceptable. Prepare to be disappointed.
1161	water hose timers: I purchased two of these timers. They don't have a provision to set the day, the hour, run time or for how long. You never know when the water will come on. I would not encourage anyone to purchase these type of timers. Having said this, I am partial to the Melnor brand as opposed to Orbit.
1162	HISTORICAL DETECTIVE WORK: Mark Adkin's THE CHARGE is a relatively recent book (1996) and seeks to explain why the Crimean War blunder was made that led to perhaps the most famous cavalry charge in history, immortalized by Tennyson's poem. Besides standard time-space analysis and you-were-there personal accounts, Mr. Adkin introduces the element of topography and what can be seen from where which influenced decision-making at the moment. This is the sort of historical detective work that should be applauded and I liken it to plotting the location of shell casings found at the Custer battlefield site to infer cavalry troop movements. I used THE CHARGE as a reference to develop a computer game and found it invaluable. It has order of battle for the armies involved and maps that locate units at certain times. I recommend this book for any student of military history interested in finding out why decisions were made as well as an excellent account of the battle.
1163	movie was ok: this movie i like and hated. road trip are starting to get scary if you don't watch what you say or do especially being gay.
1164	Poor design will leave you angry: There are some design flaws with this model. It works beautifully for the first couple dozen staples, but then the parts wear out and it will no longer function. Save your $10-$20 and get something else.
1165	Great Book - Highly recommend this!: I said inside this book that "It should be in the top drawerof every employee's desk" and I meant every single word.Matt BacakAuthor of Secrets of the Internet Millionaire Mindand The Ultimate Lead Generation Plan
1166	Truly, truly terrible: There's bad movies that are fun to watch because they're so unintentionally hilarious (ala "Cocktail", "St. Elmo's Fire", and "Staying Alive") - and then there's movies that are just plain painful to watch. Duets is the latter.Rarely does bad acting, directing, and screenwriting come together like this - in such perfect proportions to create a truly unwatchable stinker, a BOMB in the true Hollywood sense. I liked Paul Giammatti in other movies, but his character is such an annoying, whiny loser you wish Andre Braugher would just pull out his .45 and put him out of his (and the audience's) misery. But at least he's not as lifelessly dull as the other cardboard cutouts in this movie. I'd have rather seen a whole movie about the fat guy who sang "Copacabana".Who'd have thunk a movie could be so bad when it's about the high-stakes, exciting, and glamorous world of - karaoke? I bet Gwyneth still isn't speaking to daddy after he talked her into being in this turkey.
1167	This guy looks to good to be true!: Yes I havent got this guy yet so I can`t give it 5 stars. But just looking at it and hearing about it makes me want to get it everyday! the Fly Pentop Computer is #1 on my Chistmas list this year!
1168	How Tall Am I?: I was looking for a simple game I could use at my job at an integrated preschool. The children I work with are 3 to 5 years old, and they all love this game. I like all the language and academic skills we can practice in a very short amount of time. A complete game usually takes less than 15 minutes and the directions are very easy to understand. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.
1169	Excellent product, unfriendly software: Neat and easy to use. don't use its own software. Just install the drive for the webcam.
1170	Excellent product.: This is a great DVD and used along with the book (by the same name) it has been a wonderful tool in my university class. Not only is the interview between Bill Moyers and Joseph Campbell interesting, but there are many clips from _Star Wars_ and images of great art to augment their discussion. And the bonus interview with Bill Moyers and George Lucas is fascinating too.
1171	an early work, but good: Before Kaplan got really famous, he wrote this little volume of travelogue/reportage on Afghanistan. At the time, Afghanistan was a rite that the hardest of the hardcore journalists had to go through, and of those who survived to write a book about the experience, Kaplan's is one of the best. His experience scrambling around the Afghan mountains with the mujahideen is not one that many people have had, and his descriptions convey well the roughness of the terrain and people of that country. In addition, he analyzes politics astutely -- the details are sometimes moot now that everything has changed in the region, but for giving a sense of the country and its conflicted this book is superb.
1172	Shoddy merchandise: My wife and I bought 2 sets. Only two of the bags kept the vacuum seal. The rest either leaked, or worse yet, split apart. These cheap things split under the zip lock seal, despite having a reasonable amount of clothing inside. Good idea, but terrible quality. Plastic is so cheap, it makes me wonder why they didn't bother to make the things a little thicker. I hope a word to the wise is sufficient in this case. I'd hate to see anyone else waste money on this product without being warned off.
1173	Panasonic, of course.: We have been thinking about getting a bread machine since we have bread for breakfast almost everyday. After reading all the wonderful reviews, we decided to give the Panasonic a try. It now becomes the most used small appliance at home (even more than our rice cooker - oh yes, we are of Asian origin). My husband loves it so much that he takes over the baker's job and derives his own creative recipes. And of course, our friends said the breads taste just as good as those from the bakery.
1174	trilogy completed: Of course one might argue about the neccesity of the spoken intro's - I like them - Bucky serves up another fine collection of seven string guitar tunes. I think cdees like these will probably only be bought by guitar aficionados and probably seven string players so they won't mind and even enjoy Bucky's background info and anecdotes about the composers and tunes. For those who do mind; transfer the music to your Ipod or make a copy cd with only the music...
1175	I feel like I've been here before: I enjoyed reading it, so maybe two and a half or three stars.That being said, much of what I liked about this book was borrowed and adapted from Robert Penn Warren's classic "All the King's Men".
1176	Contents: The Lamb Collection ofWEST AFRICAN NARROW STRIP WEAVINGby Venice & Alastair LambEdited by Patricia FiskeExhibited at the Textile Museum: March 7 to September 20, 1975This book is a very detailed, with extensive technical and historical captions, full-page sketch-map with key, of West Africa Area of Narrow Strip Weaving Production, table of contents, acknowledgements. A lavishly illustrated exhibition-catalogue supplying technical and historical information on the subject, patterning, technique, geographical distribution, origins, incl. additional illustrations: miscellaneous cloth, Bamana cloth and smocks, Ewe and Ashanti cloths and more.48pp. 4 fine colored plates with technical captions, 63 black/white figs. in text
1177	Neat Mixer, But battery goes kaput in less than 1 year: Loved the mixer. It is neat, compact, and worked well on small to medium tasks. However, in less than one year, it would no longer hold a charge. Zip, no buzz, no purr, nothing. It could not even be charged to work for 1 second. Sorry, B&W, but you need to work on better quality rechargeable batteries for this baby.
1178	worked for one use: I cut 13 holes in 1/2" sheet rock then it would not work any more. I tried to contact Black&Decker for a replacement on there web site with no luck.
1179	A Turd Is Born: Yeah, this is the worst thing Tweedys ever done. And he's now successfully fullfilling the "tortured artist" role with his rehab stint. Meanwhile he's released this dud.
1180	"Rock This" is devoid of any humor.: I purchased "Rock This" because I think Chris Rock is a very funny stand-up comedian. Surprisingly, his book was not funny at all. I searched desperately for the humor, but could not find any. I found Rock This to be depressing, offensive, and degrading. I was considering purchasing Whoopie Goldberg's book, but after reading Rock This, I Think Not.
1181	This is the worst griddle I've ever owned: This is the worst griddle I've ever owned. It took me over 2 hours to cook a pound of bacon. 2 hours.2 long agonizing hours. and that was set at 400 degrees . It did not cook evenly. It kept shutting off. You had to keep wiggling the cord to keep the light on & still 2 freakin hours later all I had to show for it was half cooked bacon. So I cleaned the griddle up & I chucked it in the trash. If there was a score I could give that was less then 1 star I would. Black & decker should be ashamed of them selves for selling this crap. You would do better to cook bacon on a hot tin roof then you would on this griddle.
1182	Why sap the soul of InSoc for this?: I was a big fan of the first 3 InSoc albums. They all showed a great creative progression and insight, and managed to incorporate fun, thought and skill into masterpieces. Kurt has been quoted that Don't Be Afraid was how he originally intended InSoc to sound. Why after establishing InSoc as everyone's favorite danceable synth show would he choose to abandon that reputation for this depressing collection? Why not just release it under his own name?
1183	A must-read!: This book is an eye-opener, coherent and well researched. An empowering book for women AND men. You won't be disappointed!
1184	The originals were better: This CD, also titled 60th Anniversary Greatest Hits, should not be confused with a Sony/Columbia release, Frankie Yankovic and His Yanks' Greatest Hits. The current CD was not recorded on the 60th anniversary of anything. It is simply snitches and snatches of material originally released on vinyl in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. At least eight LPs from Columbia, and two from RCA, are represented. The six oldest tracks (3,4,5,7,15,19) are monophonic, except for some recently added reverb. A couple of others, including the mislabeled Ohio Polka (it's really Cherry Polka) are also mono, even though they came from an LP originally available in stereo. The quality of most of the tracks is poor. Compared to the originals, or to most any other CD, you'll have to crank up both the volume and the bass to get a decent sound. There are much better CDs by this artist, notably Songs of the Polka King Volumes 1 and 2.
1185	Don't be fooled by the size - It takes great rich pictures: Wow, what a great little camera. I needed a 35mm to go on vacation, certainly glad I picked this one. Small in size - easy to carry. Easy to load the film. Several different flash modes. Good zoom lens. Tricky on/off method (you have to slide the case open and closed). Self-timer so that you can take pictures that include yourself (so many of my families earlier pictures didn't include Dad, he was always behind the camera).But the best part of the camera is the developed product. I could not and still can not believe how great the pictures came out. I used regular Kodak 200 speed 35mm film, and the prints came out clear, detailed, bright & sharp. When the camera arrived and I saw its size, I had serious doubts that it could take a quality picture, but it definitely does just that.
1186	Corny: Usually, when I watch this kind of movie it's because I'm lazy and don't want to have to think. It helped me pass the time, but it was highly predictable.
1187	Real pictures: I like this book because it has real pictures and not drawing.It is easier to see the sign.
1188	Dislike every song: There isn't a song I like on thsi album. Every song is passionless, contrived, boring, and just senseless, talentless, andd ridiculous. It's crazy how this girl even got a record deal, shameful if you ask me.
1189	Nice phone but horrible QA forced me to return three of them: I tried three different VT 1421's, and all of them had defective headset jacks. The audio quality was OK, but since the included headset wouldn't work, it was pointless to keep the phone. I would recommend sticking to an older vTech 900 mHz digital phone like the 1930, which has worked fine for me so far for over a year. If the Quality of these phones were only better, the small size and decent clarity would have made it a keeper. Oh well.
1190	Books of Mixed Merit: The book I've read consists of several novellas, including the title novel. Perry Mason finds himself with a client who has both intimate articles of clothing and other personal items inside the murdered man's secret apartment. She also had been drugged, as had her roommate; a drug that would have been fatal if her aunt hadn't gotten a doctor in time.Mason finds himself with a client facing a murder charge, and an attempted murder charge; the death of her supposed boy-friend, and the attempt on that of her roommate. But he does have one clue... the lipstick kiss placed on the decendant's forehead.
1191	Has more to do with religion than thought: The book gets bogged down heavily in Christianity. If you think Chistianity has more to do with the lack of thought and ideas than with any reality-based idea itself, you probably won't like this book.
1192	Curt 8 " hitch extension #45791: Nice piece for extending my 2" receiver by 8 inches. Unfortunately Curt seems incapable of drilling the holes in the center. If you buy these you might need a big round file to get a pin through it.
1193	Be careful: When I received this item. I thought it would be great. Easy to install pictures. However, 2 concerns. First, I was constantly concerned about the face being scratched since keys are often thrown around in purses and pockets. The keychain is also big and heavier then expected. Not recommended for dads.
1194	Arriba Red Salsa Medium: I bought a jar of this salsa last week because I heard a lot of raves about it. I really like this salsas taste and had it with chips and later with tortillas with cheese. I don't like extremely hot salsa and this one is pretty mild for being medium. I am wondering if anyone has tried the hot version and how they like it. I would give this salsa a 5 if it were a tad hotter. I found it at the local store for around $4.50 a jar. You can't go wrong with this Roasted Red Salsa. Check it out the next time you buy salsa.
1195	Edgy, but truthful: This is a compilation of Coulter's columns where she defends her views and points out the mistakes or outright omissions of other newspapers. As usual, Coulter is abrasive which I find distracting but like Savage, this is her style. There are many times she says what many conservatives are thinking and then some. Either way, she exposes the liberal media for the biased and hypocritical lot they are while showing us that not all liberals, especially with the last name Kennedy, are annoyingly narrow-minded. It is a shame John Jr died so tragically and early, who knows what kind of world we would have with him still here in charge of George...
1196	It works, but...: I got the wide mouth jar sealer as well as the regular mouth jar saver. Both seem to work well, except the gasket keeps coming out of the regular mouth jar sealer after it has sealed a jar and when I attempt to remove it. This doesn't occur with the large-mouth jar sealer. The gasket in the large-mouth sealer seems to be firmly attached. That's my only complaint. I've used the jar sealers to seal large mouth 16 oz jars as well as 8 oz jars and I've not had any problems except for the gasket.
1197	Ex Loverboy Guitarist!!: Paul Dean was the guitarist for the group (Loverboy). He breaks a little bit from the Loverboy style and has a harder edge. The first song "Sword And Stone" was later released on the Shocker soundtrack by Bonfire. Both versions are very good but I prefer Bonfire's myself. As for the rest of the songs, they are very catchy and well crafted. This is worth getting if you are a Loverboy, Lukather, Giant, Bon Jovi or Bonfire fan.Songlist:1. Sword And Stone2. Doctor3. Draw The Line4. Dirty Fingers5. Under The Gun6. Action7. Down To The Bottom8. Black Sheep9. Politics
1198	Actually gave myself a decent haircut: The last time I tried one of these, it kept bogging down in my hair and I ended up looking like I'd been forcibly deloused. But I was tired of trying to convince stylists that yes, I really did want my hair that short. This thing worked like a charm. It's going to take a little practice to get the bit over the ears right, but I went over my entire head several times with the 1" comb and the motor didn't get stuck once. I ended up with a nice even cut at the length I was going for.
1199	Color comes off: I purchased the Orange set, and after a short time, the orange color came off as a powder. My stove would be orange, my counter,my cabinet, my dishwahser, my sink...my hands. A complete mess as it left residue on anything it touched. I ended up having to through these away as I was affraid about something toxic getting in our food.. not to mention the constant mess. What a waste of a lot of money. DO NOT BUY THESE!
1200	Royal Rumble is a half... rushed game by THQ: Why THQ would even release this is beyond me. The player modelslook [bad] and the rest of the game is even worse. Only two game modes are available and neither is fun. In exhibition mode, you can't fight outside of the ring unless the game magically *whisks* you to and backstage area. The small roster is a big disappointment since very little work went into each of the wrestlers. Just IGNORE this game. ... END
1201	Authenticity, anyone?: I love African music of every stripe, and I am not foolish enough to assume that traditions are immutable and that modification is unspeakable. I still cannot quite accept this as the music of North Africa. These CDs explore modern styles by modern artists whose only claim to their ethnic and regional underpinnings is the fact that they sing primarily in Arabic. I don't think I am passing thoughtless judgment. Yazoo Records released a brilliant bonfire of an album entitled Secret Museum of Mankind: Music of North Africa, which showcases recordings from the 20s and 30s. That CD is indispensable, the music is endlessly mysterious. The music on the CD under review is enjoyable yet culturally flat and irrelevant.
1202	life as we know it: No real chemistry between the main characters. I didn't really care what happened between them. The girl from Bridesmaids was funny.
1203	More scary Sories to tell in the dark: I Think that more scary stories to tell in the dark is a good book because it is very interesting. It also had different stories so you wont get sick of just one book. It IS A VERY GOOD BOOK I recomend to read this book
1204	Eminem Fan: I have been an fan of Em from the first silly single, but heard the rest of the first album and I was hooked. The first 3 albums were great, but this album is not. It is really hard to beat the first 3 albums and this doesnt even come close. I've heard people say since Em has had all his beef with Ja and Benzino that they wish he wouldnt take himself so seriously, well he didnt on this album. The only difference is it came out with alot of good word play, but no substance. I know in the future he can make an album equal to or better then the first 3, but I guess we will have to wait a couple years.
1205	Not what I was expecting: I grew up with the wooden game of Labyrinth so when I saw this one, I was all over it. It's a good concept but not a very good game. It's a little boring.
1206	Excellent SINGLE DISC Best Of: I recently picked this up and have enjoyed listening to it. However, I thought I was getting the 2-Disc Set, it has the same title. My own stupidity, I guess. The single disc cover is a grayish/brownish cover while the double disc cover is a blueish color. Other than that, they're identical, with Knopfler's red strat being prominently displayed.All that being said, I wish I'd paid closer attention to my purchase and got the 2-Disc set.I miss having "Telegraph Road", "So Far Away", "Calling Elvis", "Darling Pretty", "Long Road", "Sailing To Philadelphia", and "Trawlerman's Song" on my CD.This is STILL the best SINGLE DISC Best Of out there by Dire Straits, but spend the extra dollars to get the 2 CD collection instead.
1207	The most incredible styling aid I've ever used: It gets one star here for being priced at 150% of retail and using a (stolen?) picture of packaging that was changed over 2 years ago.You'd think that if they're getting so much for the product, they could afford to take some pictures.BOOOOOOOOO
1208	Totally uplifting for body and mind: I love this exercise video, I started exercising in my 4th month of pregnancy and Fitmamma was my first video. I loved it I could easily do it without getting tired or falling behind. Leisa is so good with people you feel like she is right there with you. And she slides in comments like "you should feel good about your growing body..." she makes you feel healthy not fat, as we tend to feel while pregnant. The yoga part was great because you hardly feel like your exercising but it gets your heart rate up. I also liked the Yoga because it's all just moves no crazy mumbo jumbo about breathing being your life force stuff. I'm now in my 8th month of pregnancy and still doing it. The best plus for me right now is that it really does ease back pain. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the stretching part could be longer. I would also recommend Kathy Smith Pregnancy workout.
1209	Denman Brush: The component the bristles stick into moves in and out of the handset when I brush my hair which makes it difficult to brush my hair continuously.
1210	A Weapon Of Mass Instruction: Sean Hannity's book should be required reading for high school seniors who could benefit from a detailed and thorough history lesson. If we fail to learn from our mistakes we are doomed to repeat them.
1211	Silky Smooth Skin: I bought this having had really bad acne in high school and it burning off throughout college but leaving me with really red cheeks and blotchy red spots. I bought this and after using it for the last several weeks my skin has been softer than it ever has before. It's amazing how soft it is after just a few uses. My cheeks appear to have become slightly less red, but not entirely gone. I'm sure it will take a little while. My journey continues.
1212	Just what I was hoping for!: This sandwhich maker is great for making a quick delicious treat. I like to chop up some onion and put it in there too. Definitely recommended.
1213	Backlit GBA Platinum: I purchased the wonderful GBA and then proceded to install the aftermarket backlight kit to make it perfect. It cost me an additional $35 in parts but was worth the time and effort. Mine is now perfect w/ the limited edition color. I've been playing mostly Mario Kart!...
1214	LONG DELIVERY TIME: Just a note: I tried to order this CD 05.12.2000 and had to cancel the order 22.01. after 4 delay notes. Process as such OK but 1-2 week delivery time is definitely optimistic... br, SK
1215	Emotionally draining, excellent read: I read this book in two days of intense bedtime reading. It drew me in and kept me thinking all day about the characters, their strengths, and their problems. All of the main "family" characters are well developed, multi-faceted, and interesting people. The book had the power to make me feel real pain for the characters, and had the dexterity to surprise me as a reader from time to time.
1216	no masterpiece: I rented this movie for my son. What a snoooooze fest. There was no theme, no plot. Just sailing about. There were no characters to root for, no story to follow. I ended up picking up a book. The battle didn't make sence because they never addressed the issue of why? Then the battle was over as was the movie and I was left with .....WHY???The only mildy interesting thing was that the young officers were school aged boys without hope of sprouting facial hair anytime soon. That one of these boys underwent a dramatic and maiming event and walked away... was the only riviting tale. It would have been interesting had they addressed the issue of why such young boys were sent to sea... as they were obviously blue-blooded chaps . This sub plot was too short and vastly unexplored though.If you want a good tale of the sea... try Finding Nemo, it is superior in everyway.
1217	Not relevant to me: I didn't appreciate this book when I read it because it was all I could find at the time regarding diamonds and I wanted more. It is about buying and selling diamonds on a non-professional basis. Beginners only.
1218	A terrible end to a great series: If you are considering buying all three years of this series, you need to reconsider. If you want to see just how bad a good series can become, you should buy the third year. If you prefer to see what the creators had in mind and a lovely, transporting series; stay with the first two years.I don't know that I have ever seen a series destroyed so completely as was done with the series in the third year.
1219	eh: Eh, it's okay. It is very slow for my taste but does explain the moves in detail so for a beginner it would be okay.
1220	Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex: Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is a great game to play on the game system calls PLAYSTATION 2 ( PS2 )I give it 5 STARS ""High Recommneded"" to buy this game call Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex
1221	Great family of puppets.: These are perfect for my little girls and their imagination. They are smaller than normal people puppets, and therefore fit their hands wonderfully. I can still get my hand into them to play as well, but my husband cannot.
1222	wonderful in many ways: I discovered this album as a teenager in France in 1979. I am thrilled to find it on CD. It is moving, poetic, and altogether lovely. It is also terrific for the clarity and precision of the French lyrics and the excellent grammatical structure of the long arcs of narrative in the songs -- great for improving your French.
1223	matte product -off color: This product is the MATTE version of BareMinerals Foundation and is a totally different color than the original Fairly Light...a bit confusing ..this one has way more yellow and did not match my skin tone.
1224	Great watch for beginner!: Fast delivery and good product! Highly recommend for anyone who need a watch for training. This is my first Polar watch and i am loving it!
1225	Good quality unit: Nice product. Seems well built and was fairly easy to install.I would recommend this product to anyone. n n n
1226	A must have book about the kings and queens of comedy: For anyone interested in comedy from the silent days to the Golden Era this is a must have book. The impact of big name stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, and lesser known luminaries such as Zasu Pitts and Ben Turpin , are artfully detailed in this massive volume. Rare photographs bring the good old days of comedy back to life.
1227	Nice Picturebook: Some great pictures of some rare abarths, but not worth the $15 for that. It should have been an $8 calendar instead.
1228	GCB is good ole southern fun!: If you have not seen this show you are missing out. The creators of Sex and the City and the writers of Steel Magnolias - this is a match made in heaven! The casting and writing are so good. The show is hilarious - I laughed out loud each week. Even the physical comedy is funny. The guys are easy on the eyes as well. This show is so much fun I'm doing everything I can to have ABC save GCB! savegcb.com
1229	Looks nice, Sounds poor: The Philips looked great and had a solid build but the Noise Canceling was very poor compared to other headphones I have tried (the old Logitechs this one was to replace, Bose QC2 and 3, and various airplane ones). How disappointing to have bought this new pair and then preferred the ones I used on the airplane.When listening to movies on my Dell laptop I had to crank the volume up to maximum, even in my quite hotel room. And if I had the laptop plugged into a power outlet I got a buzzing sound.The carrying case is slender and sturdy but it leaves no room to include an ipod.I returned them and will now order Audio Technica ATH-ANC7B.
1230	Excellent study guide if you're in a hurry: If you want to score high on the Bio test or if you just want to learn more about Biology, this book is definitely the best study aid. I had a pretty good biology background because I read the standard AP Bio book, but this prep aid concentrated on the important aspects and I think that really made taking the test an easy task. I got a 5 on the test without breaking much sweat because the book covered most everything that was on the test. Read it about 2-4 weeks before the test and you should get a 4 or 5. However, I also recommend reading the textbook while taking the course if your teacher is not so great because the book is real in-depth.
1231	TIGHTLY WOUND: THE HOLD ON THIS IS SPRING WOUND TIMER DID NOT WORK.I WROTE ASKING TO HAVE IT REPLACED--TO NO AVAIL.
1232	Terrible Battery Life: Camera has terrible battery life, seller did not mention this at all in the advertisement. Additionally came with piecemeal accessories, such as a charger from a PSP... seriously? The surface was dinged and the display was poor.
1233	My Favorite B-S book of all time: Aahhhhh finally my favorite!A wonderful personal daily diary on Elvis!I have just a few questions:Just how would these two "Elvis wonders" know what went on EVERYDAY of Elvis life?Were they there with Elvis every moment?Were they a fly on the wall in a past life?Did a psychic tell them EXACTLY what happened to Elvis and when?Maybe they were Elvis reincarnated?If these men knew Elvis' daily happenings, they would have to be at least 10 years old in 1935, to remember anything ... and that would make both men around 76 in age, right?ONLY ELVIS CAN WRITE HIS DIARY --- NOT THE MASTERS OF THE ELVIS UNIVERSE!
1234	Be careful!!: According to my doctor, I had an allergic reaction to this stuff. I now have a much worse rash than the original poison ivy rash. Although the scrub and spray did seem to rid me of the poison ivy, I now am on medication for a worse rash.
1235	Poor Battery: Purchased about a year ago and rarely used. Stays plugged in, but battery drains very quickly (within 1 minute of use). Now looking for a replacement and it won't be this one...
1236	Dead on Arrival: I bought one. I installed it and it didn't work. I called Netgear and waited on hold for 45 minutes. We discovered it was dead out of the box. Don't buy it.
1237	A dreadful mess featuring two gems: As if the concept of this project weren't strange enough, the bulk of the artists approach their contributions subjects too literally making this a quite painful listening experience. Particularly guilty are the tracks by Klashnekoff, Scott Walker, Stephen Merritt, & Cody ChesnuTT. What makes this CD so frustrating is that it contains two tracks that are brilliant creative gems by Imogen Heap & Rufus Wainwright. These contributions shine as among those artists best works and are the only reason to give this disc a listen or purchase.
1238	southwest anasazi archeological adventure: This is an easy read with adequate background information to give you some insight to the mysteries of the Anasazi. Personal conflicts mixed with modern day Indiana Jonesish thrills make for a compelling read. 4.5 stars out of 5.
1239	very mediocre: Passes the time, that's all. Notable that the Partisans (Communist anti-nazis) are portrayed as purely heroic, while the Chetniks (anti-communist anti-nazis) are shown as purely evil. In fact the film portrays the Chetniks as in essence a German auxiliary force--very very few historians would agree with that idea. But then, if you're filming on location in a Yugoslavia under Marshall Tito's communist dictatorship I guess you have to toe the local ideological line. Hey, it's only a movie, right?
1240	Another Winner for a great new sci-fi author!: After reading S.L. Viehl's first novel in this series,Stardoc, I waited impatiently for the sequel. Beyond Varallan did not disappoint! The chartacters are wonderfully described and developed - you can visualize each by her detailed descriptions. And yet with all this detail, the story moves along smoothly. I especially enjoyed Squilyp, the chief resident with a serious superiority complex, and the enigmatic Reever who seems to have multiple personalities- who is the true Reever?Throughout the novel the heroine manages to be a wonderful doctor clearly devoted to her adopted "family". I didn't want it to end! Can't wait for the next one - hurry up Ms. Viehl --PLEASE!
1241	I Love(d) This Camera: I bought this camera in Oct 2005. I brought it everywhere. Loved it. In April 2006, the LCD screen blew. Canon replaced it with a refurbished camera. In March 2007, the exact same thing happened to the screen and now they will only repair for $97.00, as they have determined this is the result of impact damage. How they determine this is unclear to me, as it was not dropped or impacted...Apparently, you will spend 100.00/yr maintaining this camera. That, to me, is the hallmark of a faulty product. Unfortunate - as I really loved this camera.
1242	Overall, A Good Basic Resource: Written as a basic overview of women's WWII Nursing Services, the book fits the bill exactly, and includes some good, detailed color pictures of the uniforms from each branch of service and country. If you are needing more in-depth information on uniforms, and history of any of the branches, you will need to look elsewhere. As expected from a U.S. author, more info is written on the U.S. Army Nurse Corps, than any other service, including the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps. Only the primary uniforms are mentioned, even though most had several different uniforms. If you need more specific detail on the uniforms, check out "Dressed for Duty, vol 1." by Jill Halcomb Smith, not available on Amazon, but at Abebooks.com.
1243	A Complete and Pleasant Surprise!: I was a little wary of buying this game. I found a lot of them for cheap at a used game store, and, more often than not, it means the game wasn't popular and was a waste of money for the people who got it.This is absolutely not the case for this game. It is an awesome, entertaining game that takes from WarioWare Touched! and actually gives it a story. What you do is play mini games in order to impress a girl with your spectacular stunts. Once you have completed a stage, it will be able to be played again and again in the Memories section. Plus, once you master it in the Memories section, it opens outfits for the girl you're trying to impress in Maniac mode.Drop the ten bucks and get this game. It's fast paced, colorful and a lot of fun. You won't regret it!
1244	doesn't work with multiple OS devices: The KVM doesn't work if you try to connect two devices with different operating systems. I have a Linux and Mac and it only works with Linux but not the Mac. Or if I connect a Linux computer and a Windows computer then the Linux device works but not the Windows computer. Company says a fix is being worked on but no ETA for it. Their tech support hotline isn't too helpful.
1245	stop being so closed-minded: Its a shame that people are so set in the notion that a band should continue to produce the same sound with each release. This season marks a definite change, but it is a change for the better, especially after Battle Hymns, which didn't take a single risk and was as boring as an Amazon.com listener review. Don't compare it to Blink; this is a unique cd which varies itself with each track so it never gets boring.
1246	Excellent! The author makes you feel like your there!: This is a must read. It is a good book for anyone. You develop a bond with the characters.You really get to know them. I strongly suggest this book for all ages.
1247	Should be standard with game itself: Silly that it is not included with original toy. The batteries don't last long so this is a must!
1248	Poorly Written and Edited: I don't know how you can trust this book if you are looking to invest in penny stocks. It is very poorly written and edited. There are incomplete sentences and statements that make NO sense in just the first ten pages! How on earth does this author manage to sell this when it is full of obvious errors?
1249	You don't have to be CRUNCHY to like GRANOLA but it helps!: I love Udi's because I have a number of allergies and had to find something that was natural and contained MINIMAL ingredients but still had a great taste. I have tried the few granolas out there that fit the bill and Udi's is the BEST by far.It is light and crunchy and fresh tasting, not too sweet and definitely not boring. I prefer the Au Naturel and that is simplest of all...just great tasting oats perfect for adding to yogurt or with a little milk.One thing to consider- You had better have a big family or LOVE granola since a little goes a long way and one bag lasts me a couple of weeks. Get this 6-pack and you will be all set for a while with plenty of variety!
1250	apnea: I have been diagnosed with apnea and use a CPAP. I bought four books to gain a deeper insight into my condition. While informative this book does not cover the subject nearly as well as Sleep Apnea - Phantom of the Night. I would not recommend purchase of this book.
1251	Very Pleased: First off, the price of the inversion rack was affordable. Second, assembly was easy and took about an hour. The instructions were clear. Third, the ankle holder system is comfortable for me. I am able to hang completely upside down or use the chain and do a wide range of inverted angles. The only thing I would recommend is this, even though it folds up, it doesn't really get that compact. You are better off clearing a space in your apartment or home designated for using this unless you have a large under the bed space or large closet. Otherwise, awesome product.
1252	A must see for MARTIAL ARTS fans: Shogun's Ninja was one of the first movies I saw as a child. It's a classic because it was made before they started all that special effect crap. This movie is set back in feudal japan when the emperor of Japan was trying to take over. he used his Shogun played by Sonny Chiba to carry out his plans of attack. He was ordered to kill a prominent lord and his family by the name of Mimochi. He killed mostly all of them but was unable to kill the son and a few others. The son grows up in China were he has honed his martial arts skills. Which you immediately realize when he uses it against the local military force. He has come back to Japan to revenge his parents and to restore his clan once in for all. This movie is full of fight scenes and the plot couldn't get any better with a strong storyline to back it up. You will not be disappointed I promise you. I know the whole movie by heart so if you need to know anything else just email me at davisfillis@msn.com
1253	Waste of money: Wow lets have women portrayed as neurotic, b****y, and crazy yet again in another movie. Yes we know hormones go full swing during pregnancy, but they didn't even bother really trying to make this funny.
1254	Can't complain for the price: I use this to hook up a Vizio 42" 1080P LCD TV with my Explorer 8300HD DVR. I had, like a big sucker, bought a $70 HDMI cable from a local big box store until I found and ordered this. As far as I can tell, no difference between the two in audio and video qualites! For price of a happy meal, you can't beat it.PS Of course I returned the $70 rip-off the next day.
1255	Same Disc, Different Package: This movie is excellent and deserves five stars but this release on DVD has the same problem as the first release, and because I've bought both from this studio I feel I have a right to complain. This is a long movie and Columbia has twice now saw fit to place the first half up to the Intermission on one side and the second half on the other side. Flipping a disc is something I haven't had to do since LP's vanished.
1256	WHO SAID THIS WAS GOOD?: the only good song on this CD is Bling Bling BG is the worst hotboy go buy the hot boy's cd instead it's lots better
1257	Bad even for 'healthy': I had high hopes for this, but it was bad. Really bad. The whole pan of cupcakes made from this had to be thrown out. Very gritty and dense.
1258	Spare yourself the 2 hours, and do something else: This movie is pretty much a conglomeration of brutality, blood, and complete lack of a story. I won't get into more details for those of you plan to watch it, but don't get your hopes up. Besides Liam Neeson's awesome voice (think back to Taken), there's nothing worth seeing/hearing here.
1259	Well worth reading especially considering it's free: Just finished this book and have to say I enjoyed it. Four stars and not five because I felt it dragged in places. If you like me are a big history buff then you will enjoy this book.
1260	i like Ultraman very much, but the quality of this set is just BAD!: on a crappy TV, you might not be able to notice the horrible video quality of this set. but on a new world TV it looks really bad. i dont know why that is, but it's true. i've returned 5 copies to my local shop and each one had the same issues: tons of pixelation and squiggly lines when ever there is the least bit of motion on the screen. this has nothing to do with the original video given to the company by the license holder (well, that's another story) but this problem is only because of extremely poor encoding by the manufacturer. this BCI company has a track record of releasing really horrible quality releases, and this is no exception, unfortunately. i give Ultraman 5 stars, but BCI zero stars for such a poor quality effort. i'm hoping BCI doesn't make the same mistakes with the next sets. otherwise it will crush them.
1261	Not as bad as I thought!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This is my second review for this movie.Orginally,I really hated this movie(read my first review to find out why)but it has really gotten better.I still think it is the weakest of the four but when you look past its flaws,it becomes way more enjoyable.See this if you are a Batman or Tim Burton fan.Ignore my other review for this movie
1262	Dreams From My Father: I found Obama's memoir completely engrossing. It is a challenging, and sometimes confronting, account of a young man's struggle to define himself and find purpose in a complex world. While the protagonist undertakes a personal journey of discovery, he raises questions for all of us to ponder and poignantly explores the difficulties faced by young men growing to maturity as well as what it means to be an African-American in a post-colonial present. The book is well written and engaging and I recommend it whole-heartedly.
1263	A Fascinating Look at Off-the-Cuff Decision Making: This book was an easy and fun read. But, more importantly, it gave me new insight on split-second decision making, the pros and the cons, when it works and when it doesn't. I think Mr. Gladwell's next book should be a "how to" manual on how to train oneself to make better decisions!
1264	review: It's entertaiing, I was expecting it'd be more fun. Overall it was not bad. I have watched better movies from her
1265	Fish love them, but they're an absolute mess.: These pellets are economical and fish do like them, but they have one HUGE drawback: they're filthy. In a matter of seconds in the tank they will begin to "puff up" and get soft, and start making a mess of your substrate. Even with the fish eating them, they can't keep it under control and just tend to create even more of a mess. These things will surely make a mess of your tank in no time if you don't clean up after your fish or if you don't under feed. If you are having any sort of health-oriented problem in your tank, from ammonia in the water to algae, one of the first things I'd do is stop feeding this stuff and start feeding a quality, clean food like any number of other pellets available by other companies.These are best avoided, only use them if you are in a pinch or to offer something different on a rare occasion for your fish. I'll never buy them again.
1266	Good both for beginners and for advanced users.: This is an updated tutorial and also a very good reference manual.I have the full set of official LaTeX books(the Lamport's manual, The LaTeX Companion, The LaTeX Graphics Companion,and The LaTeX Web Companion),and also this Kopka-Daly book, and the Hoenig book.The official LaTeX 'basic' books (the Lamport's manual and the LaTeXCompanion) are a bit outdated, so this is the book to buy now.If you are a beginner, this is the book for you, because it coversfrom the basics to advanced topics.If you are not a beginner, you will benefit from it, because it's updated,it's a good trade-off between a too simple basic manual and an advanced one,and because it has very useful parts, like Error Messages, Programming,and a very good and unique Command Summary chapter that is truly special.
1267	Inaccurate research of the Crusades: Former Muslims Look at the Crusades and try to tell their story.No such thing as Christian Jihad only Christian defence from Islamic aggression.We all now that Crusades have been reaction on Muslims killingsof many Christian pilgrims and aggression motivated by ambition for land in 11th century.Let's not forget that Spain had already been swept over by Islamic aggression by the time of the First Crusade..
1268	Even light folkies will dig this: It's a great cd, complete with wonderfully spun sungs. He creates an atmosphere that is very magical with his music. I am a new listener to the contemporary folk scene, and I tend to like he more popular musicians, Shindell, Gorka, Griffin. And Bill Bourne is definitely one of those musicians that can leap over from one genre and pull in poeple in that are new comeers and obtuse to the COntemporary folk scene. I can't believe that I am the first person to review this album. They play his songs all the time here on WUMB in Boston. Check it out. it's good music. I like Holy Holy, and Little Flowers. How apt, I guess Bill Bourne is a little flower himself, stepped over and passed by often without a glance. I was forced to buy his album because he isn't popular enough to be on the File sharing websites. Looks like all this file sharing is helping out those that are less then famous. That seems like a postive thing to me.
1269	Should be PG-13: Personaly, I DID NOT like this movie. Even though most of it takes place in Australia, the plot is thin, there is some sensual content, and plenty of nasty language. The Kangaroo gave it some redeeming value, (I like kangaroos) But not enough for 2 stars. I don't recommend it, but if you DO go see it, I can almost bet you wont see it twice!
1270	YOu can't miss this cd!!: From beginning to end,, you can't miss a song from this cd. Just listen to ENSENAME...and you will get the chills for sure.. TWO THUMBS UP for this super tejano singer..
1271	Poor Quality Control: The very first time I removed it to place it in another location the blades that plug into the wall pulled out and stayed stuck in the outlet! Very dangerous! I had to hurry outside to shut off the circuit breaker before anyone might touch the energized metal blades sticking out of the outlet. The blades are supposed to be soldered into the inner circuit board but they both had what are referred to as "cold" solder joints. Very poor QC work during assembly. I don't know how they got a UL approval on this thing. I put it in the trash.
1272	Parrotheads will love it: My head hurts, my feet stink and I don't love Jesus, but I love this album! Good digital quality. Highly recommend to enhance the life of any Parrothead - or those who live in states where Ganga is now legal :}.
1273	U3 is terrible: Can't stand the U3 stuff; why do manufacturers keep wanting to shove software down our throats? The U3 stuff causes a delay in loading and it's an awkward interface for software that you don't really want/need anyway. The Kingston 4 GB USB drive is selling on amazon for $17 right now, so that's a better deal. If SanDisk offered this same product without U3, it would probably deserve a 4- or 5-star rating. U3 is really useless.
1274	Classic Text, Still The Best: This book will give you a quick overview and solved examples for most of the genetics you need as an undergraduate and even into grad school. It's been around for decades.
1275	Beautiful: I'm very happy with my new bread box. It's beautiful, holds a lot and looks great on my countertop. It arrived at the specified time and was in perfect condition.
1276	This book is great: I love this book, the recipe are delicious !I'm not a great cook but with this book I look like a chef ...lolI also bought Simple and Simply Delicious by Sylvie Rocher and I love it !
1277	Vibration worse the the old mount.: I installed this in a 2005 Chrysler PT Cruser. The rubber is too hard and feel vibration. I had to install OEM mounts.
1278	Epic and beautiful masterpiece: This is an AMAZING graphic novel with an outstanding storyline. MUST READ! Everything about this book is fantastic. This is the ultimate what-could-happen book. What could happen if the government took things into its own hands?
1279	Sweeeeet: Awesome high energy songs from this Toronto duo. Danceable, fun and generally just rockin.Track list:1. Turn It Out2. Romantic Rights (1st single)3. Going Steady4. Go Home, Get Down5. Blood on Your Hands6. Black History Month7. Little Girl (my favorite)8. Cold War9. You're a Woman, I'm a Machine10. Pull Out11. Sexy Results
1280	Interplay never heard of Quality Control.: After waiting forever for something to follow Fallout 2, Interplay has dumped this game upon us. Fallout Tactics is full of bugs and serious playability issues that have ruined the potential of this game. The patches may fix some of this, but I doubt they will even come close to fixing all.Don't waste your money on this game.
1281	Really good technical book on riding: Lee Parks knows what he is talking about. This book has been extremely useful for me to improve my cornering. His step by step approach to cornering really works and gives you better control and confidence. It does take practice and faith in his approach. But I corner a hell of a lot better now than I did before reading this book. I plan to attend one of his franchised classes to further improve my skills. Buy the book--it's a good investment for your riding pleasure and safety.
1282	Elementary school fiction: Remember Clancy's first books? Remember the days when he was dedicated to giving the reader his/her money's worth? Those days and those books are not what you will find inside the cover of "SSN"! US Navy SSN finds Chinese submarine/surface ship, sinks same. Reread that sentence 60 or 70 times and save the money you would have spent on the book. All you'll be missing are a few technical terms. It seems to me that Clancy has shifted his focus from the reader to his bank account. It's a shame, he used to be very good.
1283	Purple takes you to the edge and back: I bought this CD for one reason: "Vasoline." I love that song! However, upon further listening, I found that each and every song was brilliant in its own way. From the hard-edged, organized insanity of songs like "Army Ants," "Meatplow," and "Vasoline," STP goes into softer territory with "Big Empty," and "Pretty Penny." There's something for everybody out there. If at first you only like a couple of songs, force yourself to listen to the whole CD--you will love it! Oh, and don't forget the secret song after #11 ("Kitchenware and Candy Bars")-it's hilarious!
1284	regret: i got this shea butter after hearing and reading how great it is for all type of skin condition. I had one before - very hard, ivory looking, but quicly melting - but this one is soo diferent. the color is very yellow, the type what fake mustartd has. i was trying to use it as a diaper cream, as a dry skin moistureizer and treating very mild eczema and scars but it did not do anything to any above mentioned problem. After several days I still did not see any result nor improvment. That is when I started to think of the authenticity of this product. I think I will stop using it since I have no proof of its originality and beside it really does not work. I am sad, I wish I could return it. I will try to contact the seller. If you want the real thing dont buy it.
1285	purchased this for myself! it is a fun game!: I loved the action and the CGI effects were awsome! very good plot and ending! will watch again! good value!
1286	great shape: The cd arrived in good packaging, you would have thought it was new, it was in such good condition. The music is great, real classics. If you like Little Village, this is an album you will also appreciate. I bought it to replace a well warn cassette tape.
1287	Nice :): Bought this for my mother this Christmas. I don't really know too much about it, but she says she likes it a lot. She doesn't use it too frequently, but when she needs it, she tells me that it's pretty much perfect. And I say, it's pretty much perfect too, especially for the price I paid for it!Haven't had issues with it. She says the speeds are just fine, not too agressive at all as long as you keep your mixer in the bowl when you turn it on. It won't splash batter everywhere if you also have a large enough bowl to mix in. But I'll assume that being obvious isn't what some of these reviews would have you think..Good buy overall!
1288	A diet that really works, if you put your mind to it.: I started this diet 5 days ago and boy, were the first three days hard. I never realized how addicted I was to sugar. But I stuck to it and I have lost 7 pounds, and I feel great. I am well on my way to reach my goal of 35 pounds. The book really gives you incentive to stick to the diet. You do have to be willing to cook and have many ideas for cooking eggs different ways, or you can easily get sick of them. I am a very picky eater, but I am finding a variety of foods to eat low in carbohydrates. If you want to lose weight, don't hesitate.
1289	Worst. Sci-Fi. Ever.: What the hell happened to the plot? At the end of the 2nd movie, we're left with interesting clues to how the Matrix came about, and it's clear that there is more to be revealed. And what happens? They ignore all of that in favor of an action movie that has no action and no suspense? Why add on lame characters in an attempt to tug on our heartstrings? After all of the interest and mystery of the Merovingian, Persephone, Agent Smith, Seraph, the Oracle, and the Keymaker in the 2nd movie, why abandon all of that for the last movie? This could have been an interesting movie where they tie together the clues in the 1st and 2nd movie and paint a cohesive picture of the world of the matrix and how it came about. Instead they left all of that behind. This was a waste of money. Totally unforgivable moviemaking.
1290	Excellent, readable.: This kind of book (a daily journal) is not my favorite sort (I read it all in one sitting), but there is wisdom contained herein. Deng Ming-Dao shows that the wisdom of Tao is not outdated, not confined to ancient scripture and ritual practice, but is applicable to everyday living in the here and now. Much of the writing is inspired, but there are several pages that are pure genius. Buy it, it will be well worth the money spent.
1291	MOVIE GREAT PACKAGING NOT SO GREAT: I love the Leslie Sansone in home walking routines, but I was very disappointed that this movie only came with a cardboard sleeve, not even a DVD case. I was also disappointed as the "Walk-Away Weights" are just plastic filled with water. For the price, still a good buy.
1292	Naked Boys Singing: I find this work to be both trite and silly. And not as erotic as I had hoped. Nevertheless, my curiosity is satisfied.
1293	Read it for a healthier view of yourself and others: Crabb sets forth the idea that our deep longings for true relationship inevitably lead to pain and hurt. Attempts to avoid the pain of sorrow, disappointing relationships, or conflicts rob us of the experience of our true humanness. In reality, these circumstances can push us on to a deeper awareness of our dependency on God, which in turn frees us to love ourselves and others as fallen, not-yet-glorified human beings. Though the book is intended to assist counselors and others who facilitate change in others, it also offers many insights for anyone who is seriously interested in understanding human behavior.
1294	MINI ROBERSAPEIN: This robot moves it's hands, or should I say fingers, the eyes turn red and even has a shield to pull down over the eyes and it walks. It is ok on flat floor, but not on shag carpet, or it will fall over, the problem is it just does not have enough weight to keep it upright, so it won't fall over on carpet, and it is small. I do not recommend this robot WOw Wee. Jim in Ohio
1295	Lil Jon - Lil Talent: Okay let me get this straight. If I wear dreadlocks, throwback sports apparel, big sunglasses, put some radiators in my mouth, act drunk, and scream lame unintelligible raps I too can be a big star? Alas, there is no accounting for taste or the lack thereof.Scuse me whilst I look for a bridge to leap from!
1296	Every Woman's Bible: I wish I had this book long ago, but better late than not! I have recommended it to every woman I know & anyone with daughters.
1297	Classic Mystery Date: Still a classic!: My 10 year old daughter purchased this game with a suggestion from me. I told her how much I enjoyed it as a child. When it arrived we dug right in. This game is simple enough that my six year old also could enjoy it. We had good mother and daughter fun and my girls enjoy playing it with their friends.
1298	Look for the big banana: The Big Red Fez is a quick read. This book covers the many does and don't of web site development from a user experience perspective. Even for the experienced web site designer, The Big Red Fez, back to the basic approach serves as a good reminder that the customer comes first.The loudest message from The Big Fed Fez is that the site should be about the customer not the developer, marketer or business manager. There is some good commentary on customer segmentation and how to address customer segmentation. Another useful idea is trying different approaches and measuring the results of each. There are plenty of products that make this approach feasible and the results make the effort worth while. One of the most important activities is measuring is establishing a baseline.The Big Red Fez is a quick read, but has many useful ideas and concepts. If you are an engineer, marketer or business owner manager this book provides useful insights into building a great customer experience.
1299	Doesn't get any better than this!: This is an incredible CD! A masterpiece of smooth jazz! Gregg treats us to one of the most enjoyable collection of songs, incredible really! Every song on this CD is great, having it's own unique groove. Gregg employs some incredible guitarists on this project, each guitarist blending his unique style with Gregg's keyboards. This has become my favorite CD, I play it over and over and still love it! I WOULD NOT be without this CD, it is a true work of genius. I liked Gregg Karukas before, but now I LOVE Gregg Karukas. This is a 10 out of 10, you can't go wrong! If you buy this CD and do not love it, you are hopeless!
1300	Very good cd worth the buy: I just got this cd and it has really good songs on it. Every single song is worth listening to. Listen to some of the samples and you'll see what I mean.
1301	Loved this book: Want a book that gives an introduction to the culture behind the Gospels? This book provides that information in a quick read with enough detail to help the average Bible student become more culturally aware of what Jesus ministered in.
1302	I thought it was great but then it stopped working.: I used this immersion blender probably 10 times before it stopped working. I had the same problem that a lot of the other reviews stated. One day the blade stopped spinning properly. Upon closer inspection I realized the teeth were ground down rendering the device unable to spin the blade. Major waste of money.
1303	80 pieces carving set: I AM QUITE IMPRESS WITH THIS SET IT MAKES MY TASK MUCH EASIER WHEN CARVING FRUITS WITH THE HELP OF THE SHAPED CUTTERS. IT IS DURABLE I HAVE NO REGRETS IN PURCHASING THIS ITEM AND THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT.
1304	Re-title this to "How I Spent My Summer" by Luke C., Age 7: In essence the book was about the summer experience of Luke Chandler, a seven year old. The book contained observations and story-line introductions but no resolutions or endings to dilemmas that had been introduced during the telling. It was a decent read, the writing definitely had a nostalgic flavor and a nice feel, but there was no real story. Therefore, there was no real ending. It is too bad, the characters and their situations held potential for a good story - but it all fell way short at the end.
1305	e18 error and camera died: Camera died all by itself. E18 error(well known canon problem) and lens will not work. Do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1306	Christmas in France: This book is a part of a series (another is Christmas in Germany).This is a wonderful book showing the history and traditions of French Noel. This book mentions Reveillion (the Christmas feast), the Santons of Provence along with the celebrations that are held outside of Paris.This book is excellent and I would recommend adding it to your library.
1307	worst customer service ever: I bought on december 5th a wine cellar, I received it damage and I am still waiting for a new one.The customer service is terrible!!!Dont buy anything from this company.
1308	Hepburn is Irritating.: I've seen this movie many times and each time I dislike Katherine Hepburn even more. She is completely irritating in the car accident scene and she just goes on from there. Cary Grant is, as always fabulous.
1309	Wake of the red witch: FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE FANS OF THE"DUKE"I RECOMMEND YOU ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION.MY WIFE AND I ENJOY JOHN,S FILMS AND THIS ONE IS ONE OF HIS BEST,A REAL TEAR JERKER AT THE END.
1310	Wagner: This book is easy to read, follow and understand. This diet works I use this diet years ago but had lost my book. I strongly recommend this book.
1311	Love this Product!: My son got Baby Tad when he was four months old, but now that he is 10 months old, he is starting to learn that if he pushes the buttons on Tad's tummy, they will sing a song. For boys, I would recommend this product for nine months+. I think my son was too young at 4 months, even though it was fun to push the buttons and hear Tad sing.Other recommendations: Leap Frog Hug and Learn Globe.
1312	Great job!: It is hard to find Christian videos that keep to God's word. But this one does just that. Keep up the good work!
1313	Wouldn't buy again: It broke after three or four uses. We didn't use the handle and we used it in the microwave so it might work better in a skillet but am not sure.
1314	The Best Metal CD of 2000!: RESURRECTION is, quite simply, the best album Rob Halford has done since Judas Priest's SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE. The production of Roy Z (who did Bruce Dickinson's outstanding ACCIDENT OF BIRTH) is excellent, as are the songs he co-wrote with Halford for the album (Halford also co-wrote tracks with Bob Marlette, who produced Black Sabbath's REUNION album). Combining the power of Priest's PAINKILLER with the hooks and melodic sense of SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE, RESURRECTION is classic Halford. Standout tracks include the Title Track, "Made In Hell," "Locked And Loaded," and the outstanding "duet" with Bruce Dickinson, "The One You Love To Hate" (a how-to lesson in Heavy Metal singing if there ever was one). If you like Metal with strong melodies and hooks, while still being Heavy, this album is for you. -(and if you like this one, check out Bruce Dickinson's ACCIDENT OF BIRTH, Iron Maiden's BRAVE NEW WORLD, and Armored Saint's REVELATION and SYMBOL OF SALVATION CD's)
1315	Lacking scientific support: After reading many books of this kind and looking specifically for books with a strong scientific support, I can say that this is a wonderful book in terms of images and editing, but not a good reference if one is looking for the best exercises and methodologies. Scientific evidence proves that the exercises described here are not the best choice, some of them might even be dangerous if one is not careful enough, and moreover, the muscolar districts involved in the exercise are not those that are highlighted.
1316	Before you watch just remember 3 hours you can't have back: GOD THIS MOVIE BITES!!!!!!!!! Why does it get so many stars from all people. My Gosh that movie was about the biggest wast of DVD memory or tape in the world. It is worst than the Godfather, just the same crap you see in all movies somebody hates a black guy and he is going to get the chair somehow just because he was black. DUMB! RACIST! IGNORANT!!!!! JUST BECAUSE HE IS BLACK DOES NOT MAKE HIM THE G**-D*** DEVIL ALRIGHT YOU STUPID IDIOTS!!!!!!! For crying out loud they purposely electricute a guy till he practically blows up. Jeez how can people be so heartless????? remember 6 words to remember before you watch: Three hours you can't have back. Words to live by.
1317	MORE THAN I PAID FOR..beats gave way to songs...: When I bought this review I was getting real tired of the whole neo-soul hip hop sound, but I figured that I would pick this one up just to have in the collection. Just to be real, I got way more than I expected. This almost gets daily rotation, its so hot. The beats are A+ on 90% on the album. Lyrics on point, keeps you listening. The sound has that authentic underground feel that heads love without going overboard. Think Perceptionists or Little Brother with equal, or better production. If thats enough, just turn on your radio and contrast.You wasted enough time, now buy the album...
1318	I'd give it 0 if i could: The 69 love songs is some of the worst rock/pop music ever recorded. The music is so generic and basic that anyone could have written it. Stephin Merrit has a great voice, its a shame he doesn't have a good songwriter.
1319	Disappointing: This book was not worth the time. The storyline was great and inventive, yet Cook used too many medical and chemical terminology that only few could understand. The book dragged on at points and the ending seemed rushed, as if he had to meet a deadline of sorts. I wouldn't recommend this book to be bought by anyone unless you get it for free somewhere.
1320	Great book by noted expert on Iraq: The Assassins's Gate by Gearge Packer is a great read if you want to inform yourself abour recent historical developments that led to the United States getting involved in the Iraq war.There is information in this book that I was not aware of, that while it doesn't in any way justify our involement or invasion in Iraq, does show what the reasoning was for our being there.In some ways, the book is an indictment of the Bush administration, but not a total condemnation either.If you want to get informed what this war is really all about, to see the facts laid out with clarity, then I would definately recommend this book to you. On the other hand, if you are on some kind of witch hunt against the bush administration, you will be somewhat disappointed, be cause it is not that.
1321	Very pretty!: I purchased these earrings as a Christmas gift for my mother, and she thought they were beautiful! She is taking them on the cruise they are taking this week. What higher praise could there be?
1322	Scream: This is one of the best movies from wes craven since A Nightmare On Elm Street. this movie is awesome
1323	Lacking explanations as a textbook: I am trying to learn the subject by reading this and Gelb. Even though this book covers a lot of introductory concepts, it is lacking proper derivation of equations that I usually see in most math and physics textbooks. I find this book very disappointing for its price.
1324	Great Jeans: I love these, I hope Gloria Vanderbilt continues to make this style, I'm 5'2" and find that petites are too short, regulars are too long.. but these are the correct length.
1325	Couldn't get into this one: I've anxiously awaited every Jonathan Carroll since I got hooked reading From The Teeth of Angels back in 91. But his later works have started to dim that anticipation. From Marriage of Sticks until this book, my enjoyment seems to be on a steadily downward path.What drew me to Carroll was his fantastic ability to create a scene from the "normal" world, and then show us what really lies underneath. The fantastic and metaphysical that turns the first view on its head.With this book he seems to jump into a swirling pool of the metaphysical and it doesn't seem to bear any relation to the "normal" world. If others enjoy that type of book, good. But for me it is unsettling enough that I'll read reviews before I automatically pick up the next Carroll book (unless its a reprint of an earlier great work that I've not been able to acquire yet).
1326	not impressed: Good ideas but too much teacher prep. involved. I wanted something ready to use. I've used Great Glyphs Around the Year and it's much better (reproducibles, ready to use). I'm sending this one back.
1327	Started and finished this one.: I'm a writer but I'm a reader first. Lately I'm reading smaller amounts of a lot of books. In fact a great many of them end up with a thud against the bathroom wall. I don't know about literary, but I laughed my way through this one without a bit of trouble and comedy isn't my first choice. This is survival, the Southern way. Keep it up Haywood.
1328	Driver problems with Windows 7: Although another user reported success with Windows 7, I was not so lucky. I had the card working for a bit, but upon restarting the computer, the card was not showing up in my list of ethernet adapters. It still worked but not at gigabit speed. Even when it was showing up in the list, I was not getting gigabit speed. I ended up spending several hours online to find that one must disable IPv6 to get gigabit speed to work. I finally got this changed and thought my problems were solved. Nonetheless, after rebooting my computer a second time, the adapter was again not listed and gigabit speed was lost.
1329	Adam's Navel by Michael Sims: This book attempts to explain longstanding anecdotes on parts ofthe human body-their origin, function and meaning. The historyof the handshake is explained. The integration of hand movements and language has an interconnection according to the author.The nose is cited as a part of the body which gets the leastrespect as body parts go. The purity of breasts is extolled inpop art. Overall, the book is a celebration of the human body.A criticism is that it seems to lack a unifying theme or purpose.It is unique in that the information content is out-of-the-ordinary. The author even has a passage describing the arridlandscape on the Marsian planet. The author experiments witha bold escape from conventional writing themes in favor ofamorphous theoretical concepts not subject to exact quantification.
1330	Great synthesis of post-modern, feminist, Zen thought: This book is an excellent collection of essays from a wide variety of philosophers. This is certainly not a self-help book or an inspirational collection - it a thoughtful exploration of how the acts of cooking, eating, and thinkning have implications in feminist, post-modern, and Zen philosophy. Some of my favorite essays looked at how cooking is goverened by social power relationships, how one's diet is a political act, and how eating is an integral part of a person's understanding of Self and Other. I really dug this book. Finally, the title is a great play on Martin Heidegger's "Building, Dwelling, Thinking". Check them both out!
1331	Bolle sunglasses: These turned out to be a great gift for my husband. He is a very picky man but these were excactly what we wanted. they fit right around his head with the kind of wrap around style that is perfect for him. He normally wears bolle brand normally the anacondas but I got him these by mistake for his birthday and turned out he love them better. they have a bigger lens than the other and the tinted lens help him see outside really great in the sun! I would recommend these sunglasses to any man or woman that has this type of style.
1332	Not worth the money: I tried this microphone out and it really wasn't worth the money. It recorded with less clarity than uni-directional microphones. And while that is the point of a uni-directional microphone (to dampen out background noise) this seemed to be creating some interferance of its own. I'm sending mine back.
1333	Disappointed After Reading the Cook's Illustrated Review: I bought this product after reading the Nov 2006 Cook's illustrated Review of manual sharpeners. I was looking for an affordable option to sharpen very dull knives, as electric sharpeners are not in the budget right now. Perhaps it is because my knives were very dull, but the sharpener did not return my knives to the desirable sharpened state, even after about 5 minutes of passing the sharpener over the knife. In fact, the sharpener left grooves in my blade! Now I will have to buy an electric sharpener or find someone who can professionally grind my knives into the proper sharpness. That being said, the knives are a little sharper than when they started, but I have returned the device and asked for my money back.
1334	Excellent lens for this cost: No doubt one can see the 1.8 magic. I found this lens a bit soft at 1.8 in low light. Apart from it, excellent bokeh and images. One of the best in line for Potrait shots
1335	don't bother: I got sucked in by this album because it had the sticker on it "for fans of Pink Floyd and Enigma". I should have known that they were using someone else's fame to try to capture a few $.After listening, I don't get the Floyd connection AT ALL. I can see the Enigma connection (I'm a huge fan of both of these bands by the way, especially Floyd - my favorite band since I was a kid). But as far as Enigma goes - can't hold a candle to Cretu.Don't bother unless your absolutely desperate for gregorian chant with some drum beats.Anyone want to buy my copy?///M
1336	Good make-out music: Much more interesting than Fresh Aire I or II. I must explore more Mannnheim Steamroller like this.
1337	A big gem, diamond in the rough just like Mike: This golden ticket of a VHS, that I found knocked me off of my feet. For any Michael Jackson fan it's a MUST HAVE!!!! I got one for my frined and I, it's only like 15 bucks. Originally coasts over 100 bucks, that's if you want the collectors edition, but I have enough Michael merchandise. The product came from a good company it was as it was listed and arrived earlier then expected, and the condition of the tape was good for it's age. If you like Michael you GOTTA get this, it's toooo precious. You won't be disapointed, I guantee it!
1338	A bit disappointed: This product did not work as well as I had hoped. It seemed to wear off rather quickly so I had to keep reapplying quite often. I will not purchase this again but go with the Miessence that worked a whole lot better.
1339	Sweet New Release by the Living Legends crew: Although this new release cannot compare to their best album in my opinion Almost Famous, it is still a pretty tight cd. It has sweet beats, lyrics by the best two mc;s in my opinion Murs and Asop. If you like the albums Almost Famous, and Angelz With Dirty Faces buy this. I also recommend Asop's solo album, Headshots Se7en Mixtape, and Murs Rules the World.
1340	A Big Waste: This tote is not very convenient, the outside pockets are much too large and stuff just falls out, in addition, the craftsmanship is very poor and the bag did not hold up well. Spend a little more and buy something that will last.
1341	Every CD w/ Dave matthews gets better!: i'm a huge dave matthews fan so ofcourse i want everybody to go out and buy this CD. his lyrics are awesome, its such a relaxing album. From "crash" to "busted stuff"...and now dave solo in "some devil"...they just keep getting better and i just keep falling in love w/ him more!
1342	crap: Blew shortly in 1 hr not made well wish I didn't waste my money ......Fyi blew off 300 rms with 2 of these connected :/ in a sealed box
1343	Cheaply made: This item for my Sony Ericson phone lasted me about two months and then the cables got messed up. I could only hear one side of my headphones. I was concerned the moment I got the headphones in the mail because the cables for it seemed twice as thin as the original Sony Ericson equipment and boy was I right to be suspcious. Poorly constructed. Why doesn't Sony Ericson sell their original accesories for their phones?
1344	Way overhyped and far too expensive: This book doesn't give any particulars about essays or the information on the schools. It states a bunch of fairly obvious things and gives a bunch of example essays. (I thought your essays were supposed to be different and unique.) There are far many more books that are a lot less expensive. (Perhaps the cost of being officially supported is in the price?)I got far more out of the Business Week book.
1345	Coulda been 2 songs: This CD is a total load of junk, and not my type of music. If u take the CD and cut it down to Espionage and Ha Ha Ur Dead, I would be just fine. Green Day is not really my type, so I think they suck.
1346	Don't waste your time or money: This book disappointed in the first few pages, and didn't get any better. I was really put off when the author described a weapon that does not exist in the military aresenal (.."the 30-30 carbine.."). If he made this up, I can only assume that he made up other parts of this story. A big disappointment. Mr. Batson should take up a different hobby.
1347	Range is only 10 feet!: The thermometer and timer appear to work fine, but the range of the transmitter limits the receiver to about 10 feet. That makes the remote feature almost useless. First, I tried the batteries that come with the device; then I changed them for fresh new cells, suspecting the batteries were weak, but that didn't improve the transmission range. I gave the unit one star as a remote monitor. It would deserve four or five stars if it were really useable as a remote monitor.
1348	So much still applies: This was a page turner that tells everyone how you don't need a better life through chemistry to get a thrill. Would be nice to have an update chapter now that Ted is in Texas. Still, anyone who is wondering what there is to life will get many of the tools they need to find their "True North". Wish I read it in my teens instead of my forties.
1349	Amateur Collection of Talentless Garbage: Musical ingenuity? Please. Justin Dubé's guitar work reaches the talented height of a pre-pupescent boyscout's erection. Guitar and voice coaching might help, though he should probably give up now. Really. As for the rest of the band, well, I don't want to be mean. They are not ingenius, exceptional, clever, brilliant nor are they unique, intense or spectacular, all words they use to describe themselves. As for their stage presence, well, their set reminded me of that time I prematurely ejaculated. Dubé could give a quadrepelegic a run for his money. Simply put, the album `Friends hurt Friends' is an amateur collection of talentless garbage. Enough said.
1350	A Stir of Echoes.... a waste of time: I found this book to be a complete letdown after reading some of the rave reviews on it. There was very little suspense in it and at times the author brushed lightly over any paranormal phenomena. I was left wondering what the main character Tom Holland had actually seen in some of his "dreams". The book seemed to go off in no real direction leaving me totally confused. If you are after a suspense story then i wouldn't waste your time reding this book. I can only hope the movie isn't as big a flop as i found this book to be.
1351	Does what it says: It's colorful and fun. Washed it by itself a couple times at first to keep the color from bleeding as suggested by other reviews. The towel is a little slick dry, so I spray it down with a little bit before I start my workouts so that my hands stick to it. The sweat that develops during the workout takes over later. It doesn't skid all over my mat. Like this product alot.
1352	Second Hand Stops Moving: This clock does a nice job keeping accurate time, but I have gone through two clocks and both second hands stopped moving. If I pull the batteries and restart in an hour, the second hand works for about a day. One of the reasons I wanted an analog clock was for the second hand movement. La Crosse customer support is horrible...no return calls for any of the three calls that I've placed.
1353	Skip this one: The ending of this book is definitely unsatisfying. Isn't the ending the most important part of a mystery novel? Some of King's stuff, I love. SomeI do not. This one did not do it for me.
1354	Let's be serious: This book, along with TNT's decision to provide an on-going forum for poor stand-up comedy in the way of clownish "analysis" is yet another example of society's continued willingness to elevate non-threatening style over substance Let's be serious. Bill Russell, Jim Brown, John Thompson, Julius Erving, Magic Johnson and many others represent the very best of what Black atheletes offer society....courage, intelligence, commitment AND gifts of analysis. By contrast, Barkley is an uniformed clown...a comic self-indulgence sustained by those same interests who have exploited African-Americans for years.
1355	Not shipped properly: When you read the instructions that come with these, it mentions that these are live creatures and are supposed to be shipped at the correct temperature. There was no mention of this fact in the description, and they were mailed completely unprotected... it was late June. Needless to say, the surviving population, if any, was most likely significantly less than 7 million! The seller responded immediately to my complaint with a no-questions-asked refund... which was great. However, it would be nice if they incoporated some protection in their shipping method.
1356	Really poor quality.: I have purchased disposable type brush kits in the past and this set was not even close to what I purchased before. The bristles are cut very irregularly.
1357	Good Choice: The Wheel of Futune games have been used primarily by an 6 and 8 year old,(sisters), each have one. They spend hours playing and trade off with each other as the opponet so there's two games going at the same time.It's great for the developemnt of vocabulary with some adult help at times
1358	Good actors, Good story: Even tho the feeling of depression followed through the whole movie and I was really depressed when it finished, I think this is a movie that really goes to your heart. Paul Giamatti was perfect for the role and you could really see his (Harvey Pekar's) inner pain.The story is very well told with the real Harvey Pekar as a storyteller and I really like the way the mix cartoons with real life etc.This is not a movie for kids, I'm 17 and I really liked it, but I don't think most of my friends would like it, they don't have the same cartoon interrest etc.Anyway, if you like comics, see it...
1359	Valuable tool: Great tool for theological study of Christianity however, the definitions for the Christian Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions are not exact or current to present date theological thought or definition. The body of work comes through the eyes of Protestant perspective.
1360	Not Happy: This pair of shoes split down the seam after only wearing them twice. I returned them to Amazon. I will not purchase another pair of these shoes.
1361	Waste of money: I have quite a large collection of books concerning the 18th century, primarily the F&I war era. When I heard about this book I looked forward to adding it to my library. Unfortuneately, I should not have. The book is poorly researched, if at all. If taken as a reference, it does nothing except propogate the inaccuracies that have plagued much literature on this timeframe. As sudent of the 18th century, I feel that this book was a waste of my time and money
1362	Brings back such great memories: I enjoy the somewhat loose format with with some stories having very short runtimes, getting right to the point. Mostly really well written with a parade of the usual suspect stars from the time. The ONLY knock on this collection is that the "bonus episodes" are very clearly episodes that didn't make the cut during the shows original run. And WOW, are those episodes BAD! Serious stinkers that could have been left out.
1363	Seems a good product but doesn't work well on my condition: I had heard from several people that this product gave some relief from severe arthritic and rhuematism conditions. Unfortunately in my case the relief was very minimal but that may not be true in less severe cases of my conditions
1364	It's The Best: It is the best of Earl Scruggs. No more and no less. I kept this cd on repeat for a week.
1365	Very good book: After watching so many young adults hungrily read through this series at our library, I wanted to try it out. I can honestly say I definitely am eager for book 2!
1366	lots of talent, but film is too dark and slow: First, I love all of the stars in this movie. Richard Gere (since American Gigolo), Renée Zellweger and Queen Latifa are all favorites of mine. I had never seen Catherine Zeta-Jones, but I was impressed with her talent, too. It was very cool to see them together in a musical because, other than QL, I had no idea that they all had song & dance type talent. So, for that reason, I guess that I am glad to have seen "Chicago."Despite the raw talent that was oozing from the screen, my discontent with this movie lies in two facts. It moves (way)too slowly, and it is VERY dark in both appearance and in subject matter. I even caught myself nodding off a few times.... I would not watch it again.If you want to see a gripping musical, watch Moulin Rouge.
1367	Unabridged to Terabithia: Since I reviewed this movie after the remake, February 2007, I was very disappointed watching the original. More so because in the 2007 version the parts that both Jess and Leslie imagined were very well animated. Also, there was not as much character development in the PBS version; so the viewer is not as drawn into the emotion that Jess feels when he loses his new best friend, Leslie. This story was supposed to be a tragic but revealing experience for a young pre-adolescent who has to deal with death. I was not moved by this version of the story. I believe that a talent of Annette O' Toole's stature was wasted in this Production. The film was just too short, very low budget and not developed well at all.
1368	Didn't work on a 'city groundhog' but may in the wild?: Had a groundhog raiding my bird feeder. This is in the city so he may not really have the fear of foxes. It has a strong smell so don't get it on you're clothing or step on the granulas or you'll be stinking all day.Outdoors I had to get very close to notice the odor but not indoors.My 'hog' always approaches my patio from the same areas and I watched him as he crawled across and through the grains ignoring them. I just don't think he's fearful of a fox and he certainly isn't of people.May be fine for others or on a farm or more rural setting but didn't work for me other than smelling up the bottom of my shoes (yes, I walked in it).Hate to rate this a 2 stars because it may work in another setting...
1369	THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT AND THAT'S GOOD!: I ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT'S DIFFERENT FROM MOST OTHER URBAN NOVELS AND BETTER WRITTEN. I HAD TO GET USED TO THE WAY THE MAIN CHARACTER SPEAKS BUT I THINK THAT THE WAY SHE SPEAKS MAKES HER MORE REAL. THE WHOLE BOOK IS REAL, BUT IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE "GANGSTER" OR "PERFECT SISTER" BOOKS. I LIKED ALL OF THE CHARACTERS. THE AUTHOR IS VERY DESCRIPTIVE WRITER. I ALSO LIKED THE POETRY IN THE BOOK. I WOULD DEFINITELY READ SOMETHING ELSE FROM THIS AUTHOR.
1370	Moving, wonderful book!: I finished this book last night, and had tears in my eyes. What a wonderful book! Penelope Stokes has covered it all--history, race relations, faith . . . the story of a brave woman and her family, some of whom made wise choices, and some who did not. I highly recommend this book.
1371	This is an addendum: Sent word to Amazon that this battery did not fit the Motorola i530. (Got message right on the phone screen that the battery was incompatable. The connection part is different the the factory-installed battery). Amazon said that they would forward the message to the company from which it was purchased. Have heard nothing.Remember the old adage, you can't get something for nothing. Spend the money and go to directly to Motorola for replacement parts.
1372	Great Read!: I had read Kane and Abel many years ago and decided to reread it this year. It was as wonderful as it was so many years ago. You are captured between Kane and Abel and can't wait to see how the two come together in life as their lives continue. Jeffrey Archer is a tremendous writer who grabs your attention from the first page.
1373	NICE WHILE IT LASTED, WHICH WASN'T LONG: This camera has many good features, and I found it easy to use. Unfortunately, after only 14 months of light usage, the electronics developed gremlins. The viewfinder suddenly went from color to black and white, the door began popping open on its own, and soon the viewfinder was only working half the time. The camera wasn't abused; I was filming with it one morning and it was performing normally, then suddenly not. I attempted to get a repair estimate and it wasn't easy, even at designated RCA repair shops. I was told that it would cost less to buy a new camera than it would to have this one fixed. I'm disappointed in RCA re this product. Granted, it's an inexpensive camera, but I expected a little more longevity than this.
1374	Atlantis Found: Clive Cusler has done it again. I have read every Clive Cusler book ever released and can tell you that the non-stop action, of his hero Dirk Pitt, is what makes his books so outstanding.With his fast paced narrative and the intricate weaving of several simultenous story plots, he keeps you on the edge of chair, waiting for that unexpected and exciting ending that is true Clive Cusler.
1375	Handles the truth recklessly.: This book is an even more reckless handling of the true facts that occurred on the island of Cyprus between Daskalos and the so-called Erevna than the previous book. The mystical side of Christianity is a very important subject for study. However, this account of Mystical Christianity would have done better to present the facts with a less self-motivated agenda.
1376	fine diverse horror collection: This eighteen story horror collection features tales that first appear in this book though some will have probably reappeared elsewhere since. As were the cases of the previous two collections, SHIVERS III runs the gamut of horror from the supernatural to the psychological to the suspense. Douglas Clegg makes his third appearance with several newcomers to the series like Wrath James White provide entries. None of the contributions are sub par. Especially extraordinary are Meggan C and F Paul Wilson's "Itsy Bitsy Spider", Thomas Monteleone's "Horn of Plenty" (Satchmo - enough said) and the haunting "This, That's the End of It" by Tom Piccirilli. This is a fascinating anthology especially for readers who appreciate diverse shorts.Harriet Klausner
1377	terrible set list: This is a bag of garbage songs LIVE. Only one goddamned TEN song!!! ONE! The rest is just radio friendly Pearl Sham at it's worst. God aweful set list.....
1378	Among the worst ballpoint pens I've used: I respectfully disagree with the other reviewers as my experience with this ballpoint pen has been awful. While mine says it's a medium, it is certainly not a 1.0 line. Mine is more a fine medium point. The blue ink is smudgy, the ball is scratchy and frequently blobs ink on the paper. It never starts writing without first exercising the point. Upon first using it there is an annoying movement at the tip that clicks it into the section. Generally when I begin using a ballpoint, I use it to the end, but with a quarter of the ink left in this pen, I'm throwing it out; enough is enough. While it is possible I simply got a bad one, I strongly recommend you do not buy this pen.
1379	Great for PS3!: Works great out of the box. I was searching for a headset where I would have no problem getting reception at all times, and this headset is great for my ps3. The volume control is great! Comes with 3 different size earpieces and fits very comfortable. I wear for hours on end without any discomfort at all. This is a great product for any ps3 gamer without wanting to go for the "official" ps3 headset.
1380	West bend Electric Can opener: Well made,best can opener I have owned so far,this opener is well made and heavy duty.I think this one will last.
1381	Sonic's back and better than ever!: This game must be 1,000 times better than the original Sonic Adventure. For one thing, Sega got rid of the two worst characters in SA, Amy and Big the Cat. My only real complaint is that Tails is now running around in this big heavy robot-thing that can't fly like Tails could without it. Oh well...This time, Dr. Eggman/Robotnik is out to conquer the world along with the help of the mysterious ultimate life form, Shadow. Because Sonic looks so much (I personally don't think so) like Shadow, the military has unknowingly convicted Sonic for all of Shadow's crimes! This was an interesting twist on your regular boring video game plot.The Chao, a virtual pet, is also back which is a nice break after you've beaten a level.I seriously recomnend this game, but perhaps you should consider buying it for Gamecube, because the Sega ones are hard to find lately...
1382	If you like guitar this is a CD for you!: This CD is full of great guitar. Great stuff you lesson to if you love good guitar.
1383	Don't Shoot Yourself - You'll Want to After Reading this Book!: This book is great if you want to train animals. It cannot do anything - ANYTHING - other than that. Behaviorism is lifeless and stifling, and causes just as many problems as it "solves." Pryor, a Skinner disciple, agrees with his philosophy that we have nothing to do with our actions. She states that our own creativity is actually a factor of reinforcement by others or the environment. That's not really creativity, if you think about it. This book disgusted me, especially when Pryor started her lifeless rampage that we are "evolved social animals," which may explain why she equates human behavior with animal behavior. She even goes so far to say that sex is a "mutual exchange of positive reinforcers."
1384	Terrible! Turns everything into powder or mush: I really wanted to like this disc. I use grated Parmesan in lots of food and the thick grating disk doesn't do the fine grating I want for that. I was hoping to use it to grate soap for homemade detergent and also ginger, etc. It turned the Parmesan into dust, much like the cheap canned Parmesan, not like the fancy fine grate parmesan I was hoping for. It couldn't grate the soap at all, and the ginger just turned into mush. You'd be better off just using the regular processor blade.
1385	what black men think: This was educating and eye opening, life changing, soul transforming. It should be a requirement for all young, blacks living in america.
1386	don't buy!!!!: I purchased this microwave and in less than six months it quit working. Seems to be a reoccuring trend. I wish I'd checked out some reviews before buying. Even though a one-year warranty is offered, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
1387	Thank God he has only written one book: People like Jim LeCuyer should not be allowed to influence minds - young or old. His perverse sense of human sexuality and indeed, all forms of human interaction, present a danger to anyone who reads his work. He has damaged many a young aspiring writer with his unsavory and inappropriate commentary on the world.
1388	ridiculous, actually: Stohl has very little to add to his computer's analysis--and if that were not already unforgiveable in a chess author, his lack of judgment in the lines he evaluates and includes, too many of which are entirely irrelevant to the themes and motiffs the players are exploring, completes the assessment. I am rated > 2400, and find analysis like this, UNLESS I CONDUCT IT MY SELF, next to useless: it is unlikely that a person can learn mathematics by watching someone else add.Stohl's two volumes on Kasparov is better, but let's face it, Stohl is not a great chess player, and he is not a great author. He is, as Davies has complained more generally, one of the "organization men" of the chess world, not really needed, but wanting any other form of life, compelled to impose themselves where they would most like to fit.I rate it one star, but it perhaps deserves two--if I were grading it as a doctoral thesis on the unimportant.tlt -
1389	A real stinker!: This movie was so bad it was laughable. One of those where you keep saying "It's GOT to get better!" (it doesn't). Bad story, horrible acting, cheesy slo-mo of "action" shots - this looks like a very rough 1st cut somebody salvaged from a trash bin. They didn't even finish the last scene! It just mercifully stops. I removed the CD from the player and put it directly into MY trash bin.
1390	Umm WTF???!: FYI????um scince when does a DUDE use da words FYI?????I could be wrong, the reviewer could be a girl, but i think we are dealing with some Bratz loving craized guys who like these dolls cuz they can't get a girl.
1391	add one thing: its lightspan is my favorite not lightspan soundwave its been 19 years since i heard the album much forgiveness ask
1392	Their ok...: Well I have finally installed these on a 2002 Ford Focus SVT. And to find out the ride is more bouncy and less stiff than the stock suspension. Only real problem with the install is the back shocks the top bolt assembly is too short. Had to modify the rubber grommet to get them to bolt up.So if you are driving a SVT and looking for an upgrade. I would say find another set of shocks \ Springs.
1393	Tough Read: I saw the movie, before I read the book. Saw the book sitting on the library shelf and figured I'd read it to get some understanding and clarification of the movie...NOT! I didn't understand the movie and the book really didn't help. Boy, this was a tough read. Besides the fact that there was limited punctuation, I just couldn't find the meaning of it all. The movie did follow the book very closely, except for the ending, I think, and while I was able to remember movie scenes as I read, a lot of it went WAAAAAAAAAYYY over my head.
1394	Beautiful: My kids have broken numerous other gazing globes, but this one is very substantial and thick, hopefully they aren't able to break this. It is beautiful colors, can't wait to gaze at it all summer long...
1395	Eat, pray, SHIVA: This DVD is worth every penny - over 4 hours of vinyasa in a matrix format! Shiva leads you in a quiet, soothing voice through her workout which is set in a charming desert, among other places. You get to mess with a matrix which allows you to pick which poses you want to team together and which part of your body you'd rather do. Additional meditation clips are also included.However, the most important thing is how you feel once you work with her through just 1 or 2 clips! She has an amazing way of relaxing you while working your every muscle with these poses!! I highly recommend her. If you want just one, do her Shakti DVD though!
1396	Ok but not the best: I got this to cool my Acer 5672WLMi laptop when I travel with it (it gets very hot when I don't have 2-3 external fans blowing on it). I tried it out on a regular flat table and without additional fans, my palm rests would still make my hands sweat and the table top beneath would still become very hot after 2 hours of light use. From what I could tell, the air wasn't getting from the back to the very front due to the incline so I might try using a second fan or book to prop the other half of the computer up so the air can circulate completely. I was tempted to give this item 3 stars but I know how hot my computer can get so this item gets the benefit of the doubt.
1397	Returned: So, this book was written by MIT faculty in an attempt to legitimize games. Their way of legitimizing games was by being as long-winded as is humanly possible.Needless to say, this book was not very interesting in the least.
1398	I don't feel so strange anymore...: This book has helped to clear up confusion that I've had about myself. I've always known that I'm different. I've always had to work harder, no matter how hard I thought I was already working. This book has helped me to understand that I AM NOT A SLACKER! Read this and get motivated. Get tested and diagnosed! It's comforting to read about my behaviors and know that they are talking about lots of others out there who do just as I do! I'm not just a daydreaming, procrastinating, working on a dozen things at once goofball who is always behind!
1399	I loved it until ...: I loved this heart rate monitor. Yes, it does have reliability issues. But I was able to overlook that. It felt like I had my own personal trainer. It was a nice gadget. I loved tracking my workout progress. Then after a month and a half of everyday use. It died. Maybe I just had a bad one. But if I'm going to spend $150 and it is only going to last a month. I don't think it is worth it.
1400	Some Like It Strong: I know many folks do not follow the guideline of one scoop per cup, and that's fine. This pot might work for you.But if you do, this coffemaker will NOT work for you. If you put more than 7-8 scoops of coffee in the basket, the grounds overflow into your water reservoir. I am now using a $30 Mr. Coffee that works much, much better.
1401	Wake Up!: What are you people talking about? Forget all good reviews posted here. THE FILM IS CRAP.Watch it if you want (like myself) to see the Chloe Sevigny doing a fellatio. The film has an excuse (or meaning if you like) for the wanderings of the hero, but why such graphic sex scene? I can only assume Mr Gallo is trying secure audience. Maybe is because I don't have an open mind...Get lost: sexual liberation is from the seventies, man! This is no Caligula, which even the porn scenes can't spoil the film.
1402	DVD Special Feature Abuse Alert: I couldn't believe the poor decision making skills of this director, most of which have been well detailed already, though I was particularly stunned at his choice to include numerous, over-long, nearly identical "alternate" scenes and endings, and then his inability to stop himself admitting to planting good reviews on message boards, then indulging in a neurotic yet boring tirade on movie critics in place of a director's commentary. (I guess even HE didn't have much interesting to say about the movie.) Oh, but that random girl sitting next to him in the back of the car (where he performs his short oration with the explanation that, what with technology and all, you don't have to sit in a boring old office anymore! it's so much better to be out doing stuff!) looking out the window and not saying anything? She was really pretty.I couldn't stop watching it all though, as one would a train wreck.
1403	The ultimate book!: This is a big book on Matchbox toys!If you love these toys you will love this book.Its colour pages of various matchbox toys will help you reminisce your childhood days with your favourite matchbox toys.This is a brilliant history of matchbox toys with superb photos and a story to impress.If you can find a copy of this book,grab it.Its worth it.
1404	great stocking stuffer: absolutely everyone I ever gave this to loved it. practical piece, sturdy, and easy to throw in the glove compartment
1405	Nice little notebook for $1.50: I admit it, I bought this item so I would buy $25 worth of stuff and therefore get free shipping. But this is a really nice little notebook. It would be the perfect thing to put in a Victorian styled Christmas basket or for multiple gifts to co-workers or friends. It is small and thin, see the dimensions, but the cover is very well printed, the Morris wallpaper looks great, it is well bound and you could carry it in your purse with ease. I don't know what others are expecting for $1.50, but this exceeded my expectations. It is 64 pages and I use both sides of the paper, so this is 128 pages for me and that is plenty. I may even recommend them to others when I give them class assignments, all the notes for the session would fit in them and it would be so easy to carry around.
1406	No Mac Support!: I was told, when I bought this at Christmas, that it took a standard USB 2.0 cable, which is true, and that it would work with either my wife's PC or my Mac. It will Not work with a Mac -- no software available, and my wife has no USB ports available. I am going to have to purchase a hub for her PC, import files there, hopefully, and then move them to my Mac, which has software that will work with the sound files. Extremely inconvenient. Nothing on the package indicated it would only work with Windows; I wouldn't have bought it if it had. (I have found numerous posts saying that Mac owners have contacted Olympus about this. None have received Any responses!
1407	Electrifying: Henry Miller captivates the reader from the first sentences, with his strong and astonishing philosophical thoughts and criticism of religion, of life in America.He is so daring, direct, sarcastic, obscene, cold, violent, cynical, erratic, passionate, that you feel as if bent, torn, whipped by a storm, a twister, crying and screaming, yet feeling marvelously alive.With his stunning surrealistic, nihilistic style, you endlessly fly from one world to another, delirious, chaotic, mad, free, ecstatic.
1408	Jargon, jargon, jargon.: Flanigan's book seems to address those who have been injured on a deep level and must go through a series of exercises in order to "name the injurer", "claim the injury", "identify the injury," etc. If you have suffered a horrific injury (especially as a child) and are unsure of how to come to terms with reclaiming your life, this may be the book for you. Flanigan defines "unforgivable" injuries as those which compromise our well-being, self-esteem and general trust in others. If you have suffered a different type of injury, such as betrayal or deceit, I recommend any of Smedes' books to navigate your way through the forgiving process. Good luck!
1409	YUM!: I love these snacks, especially the Valdosta blend. The others are good, but lack the crunchy punch of the Valdosta. It's a great snack or salad topper. Delicious and good for you!
1410	Didn't hate it, but...: Didn't hate it, but this should have been marked; for 'tweens' only. The story as writen is amed at a young audience. Good idea, but a better wrighter could have made it work for an older croud. It didn't work for me.
1411	Over the Top and down to the bottom: Over the top and down to the bottom of the movie list this lousy film belongs. One of the great bad films of the 80's !
1412	Nine Out Of Ten: If you know this show, you know it is great. The original recording left much to be desired in record quality, which this album transcends. Raoul Julia was fabulous on the the original and Jonathon Price raises the bar with his version of "Only With You". The real shining star is Elaine Paige...she is heartbreaking on "Unusual Way" and reminds us why we love her. For a real treat go to track 12 and turn it up really loud. "The Bells of St. Sebastian" has never sounded so full and alarming. This concert recording is a must for any Nine,Yeston or Fellini fan. The Price is worth it!
1413	Hollywood Musicals of the 50's: Very disappointing. We didn't even watch all of it.......would return for a refund if I could. It's nothing but advertisements of the movies,lots of print (telling it's in what kind of color, extravaganza, etc.) Boring! It had VERY brief segments from different movies. I thought there would be some complete movies, not just segments. The cover even shows 6 specific movies!!
1414	A great explanation of a little-understood topic: This is a very little-understood topic, especially among Filipino Java Developers. Reading it came at the right time, just when I'm starting to write some real concurrent apps.This book helps even if you never plan to DIY concurrency, and are happy to rely on app server functionality. If you will never use concurrent or multithreaded Java - doubtful - JCIP is still useful because it helps you understand some Java concepts in a practical setting.If you haven't, reading Joshua Bloch's Effective Java first is recommended.
1415	Warning: The protagonist is a rapist: Seriously, the protagonist rapes a woman almost as soon as he gets to fantasy land and can feel pleasure in his nerve endings. If that squicks you out, avoid the book. Otherwise the book then deals with the consequences of that rape, as do books following. This series is designed to counter all the fantasy tropes, including the idea that the hero has to be good.
1416	A very good album after a long time: I've been following DMB's carreer since 1994 and had not heard such a good album by them in quite a while.Never mind the popular 'I did it'. It doesn't speak well enough about the album.Pieces like 'The Space Between' and 'Mother Father' (with the participation of Carlos Santana), show you that these guys have come back with a very high caliber album that brings back some of their early feel, along with some ground breaking work.I recommend it highly.
1417	Poor Design: This tools not worth buying. If you are looking for a Multitool keep looking. This thing is too heavy, the knive is too small, the screw driver twisted off when I used it once, the wire cutter made it thru one cut in 14ga wire. This should be called a "one use tools" "OUT".
1418	Don't waste your time in returns and refunds!: It doesn't fit 17" notebooks even the product was design for those, If you have a VAIO Series AR please don't buy this product, you will return, and waste time. effort and monney for the shipping costs!The product is really nice but for smaller notebooks, when you buy a VAIO AR series notebook this is the reference for a backpack but don't let that convince you is a LIE! The costures on the fabrics are week and don't resist the weigth and wide of a 17"inches notebook.
1419	No Rymne Nor Reason: A fantastic read. I can almost hear the British accent. This author is surely on her way!
1420	Complaint.: Hi, I bought a book almost 2 months ago , and haven't receive it yet , I checked in the your web page and no news about it! please help !!!Antonio Amaya
1421	Great, comprehensive and easy to follow: Maximum Security was, and still is the best book on security, hackers, etc. All other books just explain what they do, and how to stop it. Max. Security gives detailed descriptions on how to perform the hack, tools to use, and much more! I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in computers and security.

1423	When it works is great-when it doesn't the service [is bad]: I received it three weeks ago and it has excellent features. Everything I was looking for until a week ago when it stoped working. Since than I am trying to have it fixed under waranty - a huge phone bill and nothing to show for....
1424	They call this a movie???: This movie is terrible! Not only is the acting awful, the story is hard to follow and it's just stupid in general. I have nothing good to say about this movie. It wasn't even scary!
1425	Oh, Boy.: Charlie Band does it again. He takes a tape master and transfers it onto DVD. Don't look for crystal clarity here, just trailers and scenes from horror films that were released by Wizard Video on VHS in the early-80's.
1426	deeply entertaining followup...: TEETH is the second book from author Cotterill and the second in a series about Laos national coroner Dr. Suri. Fans of the first book (The Coroner's Lunch) won't find it quite as good, but it is still quite a treat: a mystery story with a sense of the rythyms and tastes of exotic mid-1970s Laos, following the communist takeover.A good bit of this book is taken up with Suri's interaction with the spirit world, which could have been kind of fluffy and unoriginal in other hands, but here has both a spritely wit and the cadences and flavor of "the real thing".It's clear that Cotterill is still learning his craft. There are some less assured moments here, including the cutting down of the loudspeaker bit and the attempted humor of the recurring greeting. But overall this is a delightful book in its own right and gives hope that we'll see more (and better) books in this series in the future.
1427	Live Can Sometimes Be Much Better Than Studio...: Donna is the only professional female vocalist in my eyes ( and ears) that sounds awesome live ( if not more so than her studio work) than any other so-called divas out there. Her vocal ability is more powerful now and stronger than 15-20 years ago. Ms. Summer's vocals have matured like a bottle of fine and classy wine; They pack more punch now than they did 15-20 years ago! Singers like Mariah Carey, and Whitney Houston can pay homage to this great artist of our time for paving the way ! Keep the music coming Donna !A fan since 1978 ( Since the first Live and More album; not c.d.) !
1428	Generally good overview, but missing details: We found the book to be a good start for planning our New Orleans trip, and once there, a good reference for addresses, phone numbers, and basic services. It falls short on some of the details, such as not even mentioning Tipitina's or some other well-known places that we found recommended in other sources (yes, I know it isn't totally comprehensive, and maybe it's just a little out of date). The reviews and advice were right on. We used several walking tours we got from out travel agent, as well as a review in an American Airlines magazine as a guide, and between the three of them we had a great vacation. Also, NO is quite spread out, so an index or something by area (French Quarter, Garden District, Metairie, etc.) would have been very helpful.
1429	Not as informative as I hoped it would be: I assumed this book would be about home automation, but it only briefly touches on that. It is mostly about wiring of distributed audio and video, which I didn't find very interesting.The book does contain some interesting and useful information, but it could probably all be squeezed into about 30 pages.The reader is directed to an an accompanying web site for up-to-date information, but the web site was last updated three years before the latest edition of the book was published.
1430	Terrible, terrible price.: We fed our baby this formula for several months - until we realized that we were spending nearly $150/month on formula alone.We consulted our pediatrician as well as a pediatric nutritionist, and both told us that there is very little difference in the formulas from major brands because they are heavily regulated.We then went to Costco where we were able to find the Kirkland brand of formula for $60.00 for six 25.7 oz cans. Read the label - it has all the brain boosting stuff (dha, etc.) as well as nearly identical vitamins, minerals, iron, etc. If you don't want the Kirkland brand, Costco also sells other major brands for similar prices.If for some reason you really want to pay more to get the Nestle brand, note as well that this 6-pack is at almost no financial advantage to buying a single can - the only benefit is that you get all 6 at once.By the way, we're big fans of Amazon.com in general - just not on this product.
1431	This box set Knocks Me Off My Feet: I totally agree with all the reviewers on this page: The box is a knock out! In order for many artists' box sets to sell, they need to add unreleased material. What one notices about this box is the fact there is virtually no unreleased material and yet one does not feel cheated. The CDs are packed to the gills and there is no stretching or padding. The four CDs are well paced and selected.One correction to one of the reviewers: Master Blaster Jammin' is on the box (there are 16 tracks on disc three).Even though there are no unreleased cuts, there are a few rarities: Until You Come Back To Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do) is from the deleted Looking Back (3 LP anthology). Fingertips (Pts I & II) is the full seven minute version remixed from the original 3 track tapes. Ribbon In The Sky is a slightly extended version.Terrific sound with a wonderful booklet with tons of photos. This is a box set worth every penny. Get this and let it knock you off your feet
1432	From the inside cover:: "You're going to purr with delight as you leaf through this unforgettable collection of cats. From Kooler Design Studio's Barbara Baatz comes 40 adorable designs, along with a complete kitty alphabet." Cross stitch charts for both large and small projects.
1433	A magical tale: I read this book while living in Australia. I decided that while I was there, I wanted to discover more Australian authors and Murray Bail was at the top of my list. Anyone interested in learning more about Australian literature should read one of Bail's novels. Eucalyptus fuses fantasy with appreciation for a symbol of Australia: the eucalyptus. While the novel contains a message about acceptance - in this case a father's acceptance of his daughter's choices - it is not a particularly deep novel. Even so, the evocative writing carries the reader along for the ride effortlessly.
1434	Like to art work. Not sure about the text.: First off I am not a JW. I was raised in a religiously tolerant home. I've read books from many different religions. Have't been impressed by to many of them, no matter which religion put them out. I actually got the book at a book sale in a box of old free books. I have read it & compared it's contents with several different bibles I have. Some of what is here makes since with my scripture searc & some of it doesn't. But I find that in ALL of the religious stuff I have read, again from just about any group or sect is the same way. I gave it 5 stars for the imaginative & colorful art work.
1435	Got Lazertran?: This is a book on how to use Lazertran, a kind of transfer paper. There are many, many different ways of doing an image transfer - heat, pressure, chemical, etc. - and this book covers none of them. It should be titled: The New Book of Lazertran Image Transfer. And I had to give it one star because Amazon does not have a no-star option.
1436	Great for teaching letter sounds: My daughter got this as a Christmas gift when she was 16 months old. Three months later, she can identify several letters and their sounds on a consistent basis. The only critique I have of this toy is that the volume switch is right on the front, so she's constantly turning it up to the loudest setting. Otherwise, it's a great toy for getting kids familiar with the alphabet.
1437	Did not work for Rott: The bristles were too far spaced out to work on my rott/pitt mix. It didn't seem to grab there hair that I needed and just turned into a toy for the pup as it was no use to me. This would probably be much better on dogs with thicker coats.
1438	GROSS BUILD-UP!!!: I had this mug for approximately two years (and it was working quite well), except I noticed my flow of coffee slowing down...so I figured the little hole that lets air in was clogged. Well once I really started inspecting the underside of the cap, only then did I realize the amount of buildup of two years of GUNK! It was absolutely disgusting. Because it was such a small area, I had to use an eyeglass screwdriver to scrape the stuff out - after about ten minutes of scraping layers of gunk out, I finally soaked it in really hot water - only for more gunk to loosen up!I have been VERY consistent with giving this mug a good wash every night - but there is no easy way to clean up the underneath and what you end up with are many layers of who knows what - absolutely nasty.I will miss my mug and the convenience of having hot coffee for awhile after the pour, and the spillproof techonology, but I will be going back to a much simpler design.
1439	Handy: I found this book to be handy for my clinical rotation because it was small and easy to carry around and was easy to find what I needed quickly!
1440	America NEEDS more pornographers!!!: The fact that Larry Flynt has earned the undying gratitude of the Democratic Party is more of a sad commentary on that party than it is a compliment to Mr. Flynt! Yes, he's worked his way to the top and is now a millionaire --- but we could say the same about John Gotti or the Reverend Jim Baker, and I certainly don't respect them!No, I'm afraid Mr. Flynt is a flash in the pan, who will soon be discarded by his Democratic Party friends as the 2000 election nears. And these books showing him to be a heroic figure will fizzle out as well --- after all, Larry Flynt's loyal readership requires full-frontal nudity in all of their reading material.
1441	I don't like this at all: A lot of things about this book say 'CULT' to me. You have its adherents going, "the course", the book takes this authoritative tone - based on what? Let's not be misguided, this person speaks for herself. Even if some spirit told her this, it doesn't make sense to rely so much on it and I feel very aprehensive when she chooses to hijack the name of Jesus for this book's authorship. If this isn't the historical Jesus but a spirit that conveys the truth of Jesus or whatever that means ... why try to rope in people with the name; she knows she can sway people that way. First page says free will doesn't allow you to set the curriculum. Excuse me? What do you think you're doing? She gives her religion a formal title of 'ACIM' with a logo/"spiritual symbol" of it's own. A lot of teachings might be found in other forms, Buddhism and so on. I'll take my info from there, not from some creepy person who sounds every bit like a sham cult leader.
1442	Inadquate info. on world retirement loc.,& finance handling: Nice pictures but need more world retirement destinations to call it a "World" book. For early retirements such as at age 50, need names of reputable finance institutions that can handle accounts while retirees are at play in the sun. You can either add this information to your next update or write a new book on retiree finances that include 401K's and early retirement options. I would love to see something of this nature. Good luck.
1443	Captivating, inventive music: This Spanish trio is one of the most creative and eclectic world music bands of recent vintage, although, admittedly, they do have a bit of a prefab, made-for-NPR-and-Borders sheen to them. On this disc they shy away a bit from the slightly ambient leanings of earlier albums, and delve deeper into the Arabic shrillness of Spain's Moorish heritage. There's also still plenty of crosscultural intersplicing, with hints of Celtic, Asian and African music throughout, as well as an ever-present, ever-clever bit of Appalachian banjo picking and country guitar which pops up from time to time. It's a deftly crafted, seamlessly produced album, which balances gritty traditionalism and modern sleekness with admirable grace. A very accessible version of Arabic music, and an album that can grow on you, quite quickly... check it out!
1444	Three Cups of Tea BOOK: After much procrastination, I finally sat down and read this book for my book club. I usually don't enjoy reading about The Middle East and all its problems, but was pleasantly surprised by the content of this book. It was a very satisfying read! Greg Mortenson is definitely a hero to so many people! I highly recommend this book! And I intend to pass it on to all my family and friends, Conservatives and Liberals alike!!
1445	Perfecto: El pantalón es de óptima calidad, a un precio excepcional y cumple todas las expectativas. Satisfacción plena con este artículo.
1446	Whirley-Pop Popcorn Popper: I love this product! I bought it before, but didn't put a warranty on it and had to order it again. Either way, it's an excellent way to make popcorn!
1447	TWO STARS ONLY FOR THE STORY LINE: Quite frankly, I was embarrassed for all the blokes that decided to do this movie 'au naturel'. If I were equipped as little as all of them were, I certainly would never have done a nude movie that's for sure. Thank goodness the cameras caught very few close-up shots of their private parts!For the storyline, I must admit that it was kind of OK. A bit stupid in some segments, but OK. Definitely not one to add to one's DVD library like I did. Put it at the back of the stack if you do decide to buy it. I would suggest if this is your cup of tea, rent it first.
1448	Maybe Later: One Girl's Struggle with the English Language: What incredible drivel. The subject matter obviously is autobiographical . . . which, in many cases, can be riveting reading. However, with "Maybe Later," it's obvious that the author has lived a life only she could ever construe as interesting. The writing skills are so poor that one wonders how the author could be teaching English to America's youth, when it is apparent that a basic high school writing class is what she needs to attend. I have reviewed over 2,200 books in my career and this is, by far, the worst. Don't waste your money on this juvenile trash.
1449	The real page-turner for non-native speakers of English !!: It's a wonderful reading for people who do not speak English in everyday life. This was my first Sheldon book and I had much more fun with this "Best Laid Plans" than with any other book I had ever read.It's written in plain English, no dictionaries are needed, and a catching story all along the line, so I didn't get bored at all.I would recommend it anyone who wants to feel "Wow, I've got better at English !!"
1450	Tattlin' Madeline: I would have wanted to know the targeted age for the reader (or listener) for this story. The author masterfully teaches the value of social skills.
1451	Don't waste your time!: Based on reviews that raved about this movie and how freightening this movie was, I really expected more. I was never scared throughout the entire movie, the Wizard of Oz is a scarier movie. I thought that the extras on the DVD were better than the movie itself. I new the audio and video would be subpar since the majority of the film was recorded on HI8. I for one hope that this does not start a trend in movies, unless there is some sort of discount at the theatre. This movie was basically an amateur video billed as a major motion picture.
1452	Wild World of Sports Bloopers - Baseball: This "bloopers" video was not even close to being funny. There were several segments that where shown multiple times during the course of the video, I guess to make it longer. I was sorry I wasted my money on this video.
1453	Easy to use: Currently using one and it is very easy to use, just insert in the usb and transfer. I have used with Windows XP, and MAC OS and it works great.
1454	A great cross-disciplinary work: This scolarly work by Dr Jansen takes as its focus the remarkable and strange psycho-pharmacological properties of a substance that is both anesthetic and psychedelic.Psychoactive drugs are a rich source of information about the workings of the mind/brain, and psychedelic compounds in particular straddle a very strange area between notions of mind and matter, or the physical and the spiritual. Their study therefore requires a balanced and multi-disciplinary approach, which Dr Jansen has skillfully managed, by acknowledging the biological, experiential, philosophical, therapeutic and social aspects of this phenomena simultaniously.This cross-disciplinary perspective is what makes this book, despite what may seem a specialist subject matter, of great importance, interest and value to anyone working within neuroscientific, psychotherapeutic and spiritual fields of exploration.
1455	About life: I am not a fan of basketball. But I found this book to be more than about the game of basketball...it is about life. I'm sure many people can see themselves in this book. I highly recommend it.
1456	good book: I picked this one up ,and enjoyed it through the whole thing. I enjoy short stories. And thats what this book has. The only annoying thing was that in between some of the stories, a chapter would be put in explaining snipers and random stuff. It kinda threw off the flow of actually reading a persons one story. But do what I did ,and skip those chapters. I'm pretty sure there was interesting stuff in those chapters ,but I read one and a half of them ,and was bored. On to the stories. Well worth checking out
1457	Magnificent: Ok, it's not the four hour A&E version but you will be amazed at how much they packed into this version while still staying true to the book. Keira Knightley is completely engaging and infectious as Elizabeth. I found Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy a little to "mushy" at times, but over all delightful. Keira's Elizabeth is witty and sharp. An enjoyable way to spend the evening.
1458	Hoo-boy: It's kinda like a bad porno .. except without the nudity and sex .. Just the cheesy bad acting, It does have some unintentional comedic value ... hence the two stars.
1459	Buy This Book: If you have read this far, you are probably contemplating buying this book for yourself or for someone else. Do it. You won't be sorry.The author's experiences are delicious: just the sort of thing we travel readers love to savor. What makes them special is the writer. A middle aged American Mom, not an Extreme Adventurer, moving in with Irian Jaya natives or being stopped by Nicaraguan rebels ... who wouldn't fantasize him/herself in those shoes? And isn't that why we read about travel, after all?The author has a light, deft touch. She is at her best in describing the people and food she encounters. And she does have a way of enabling those encounters, although she would tell us she is merely being open to them.You'll be charmed, delighted, reflective, and envious in reading this. A terrific self-discovery through travel book.
1460	Surprisingly strong: BEACOUPS OF BLUES is a strong country rock album released a year before the Eagles came on the scene and hogged all the credit for starting the genre. The songs are strong, though some are on the twangy side. "$15 Draw" is the best song on the album, followed by Ringo's own composition "Coochy Coochy." His voice is well suited for the material and Ringo was also blessed to work with the best Nashville songwriters and session players of the day. A much stronger album than his debut, Ringo does shine on this CD. I'd give it five stars, but as I said there is some twang which mildly takes away from what is truly an enjoyable album.
1461	Get To Know Why Things Go Wrong: Ever since we have been trying to improve our environment or ourselves things seem to go unexpectidly wrong. This book has some compelling arguments about why. It was a good read even if the author does go past his arguments at times. Good references though I haven't check any. Should be good for preliminary college paper research.
1462	Megumi Hayashibara, one of my absolute favs!: It's possible Hayashibara-San is among the best anime and J-Pop singers in Japan. (Don't flame me I said possibly) Anyways, after listening to all of her CDs and this set, I'd have to say it blew me away. A perfect buy for any Megumi fan, a perfect buy for anyone who just likes Japanese J-Pop,in fact. Although I'm fond of her CD Bertemu,this is all in all a good set. You should definatly try it out.~~Mei Mei
1463	Very disappointed: After reading Christy, I was actually looking forward to this book. I want to reconnect with God and find spiritual balance that I lost after my mother died. While Mrs. Marshall was able to talk honestly about Germany's past, she could not do the same regarding America. Maybe if you're a middle to upper class white conservative christian you will find peace in this book. I can't overlook facts on my journey to Christ. I'm seeking the truth but in this book have to brush over not only American history but my own experience as a minority, as "seeking material gain".
1464	A great book..really...: This book was really incedible. It just grabbed your attention and made the reader feel as if they were there witnessing, and maybe even participating, in this story. With the descriptive details and realistic events, it is quite a remarkable book to read. It just opens up the reader's eyes to the world of confusing pain and the unknown of the human mind. It truely was a wonderful book.
1465	102 minutes: Great Read and very detailed with human touch. Great follow up as to some of the survivors. Leaves reader with many questions about safety of high rise towers.
1466	Gosh I wish Braun still made a 12 cup!: Lived w/ the Cuisinart for about 6 mos now and yes, it makes a good cup of coffee but the ergonomics could not be much worse.Basket is a bear to retrieve, unit has to be pulled out from the wall about 6 inches to access and make coffee. Water target is very small and carafe leaks all over the place if you try to pour too fast (cover on or off). Cover does not seat well on carafe. Tedious and frustrating every time I make coffee.We had a Braun 12 cup for about 6 years and it had none of these issues. I just love when companies un-invent what worked and what was Braun thinking when they discontinued the 12 cup? Not much to choose from here so for coffee quality, this one gets the two stars but everything else is about a zero.
1467	Didn't work long enough to get money's worth!: I had the Melitta one and a half years when the heating mechanism stopped working which meant it didn't brew coffee. I called customer service and they said they wouldn't do anything about it since it was over one year. I paid $200 for it and feel it is unacceptable for it to only have worked for that amount of time and that customer service wouldn't reimburse me for any of the amount. What a waste of money.
1468	Too Bad I Wore the Old Pair Out. New Ones are Awful: So happy to see this style still available. My current pair is at least 10 years old and it's time to order another pair. These shoes are amazing walking shoes and while I don't wear mine a lot at home, I wouldn't be caught dead without them on a trip to a walking city such as NY or SF. I can walk 10 miles per day in these shoes and they're as comfy as going barefoot. Highest recommendation!Update: Finally started putting some miles on the new pair and they're HORRIBLE! I feel like someone has whacked the balls of my feet with a blunt instrument. I've added cushioning products and while they help, the pain is still there. These new shoes are not the high quality Clark shoes I've purchased in the past.
1469	Get the new edition, not the 9th edition: I am the co-author of this book. the 10th edition is now out. If you are a student, you'll want that. If you're trying to learn on your own, you'll find this 9th edition adequate and much cheaper. good luck. roman
1470	FOURTEEN HOURS: Really taut and well-done. Richard Baseheart is the potential jumper with an overbearing, neurotic Agnes Moorehead mother, a distant, alcoholic father, and an ex-girlfriend, Barbara Bel Geddes, whom he jilted because he knew he could "never make her happy". I wonder what his problem could be? Paul Douglas is good-as-usual as the traffic cop recruited into the role of crisis negotiator. Nicely skewers the ghoulish media spectacle that inevitably coalesces, but doesn't yell at us soulless masses in the way ACE IN THE HOLE does. Vignettes that spring up amongst the gawkers aren't terribly compelling, but still keep things from getting monotonous. Crisp NYC location shooting blends really well with the excellent model and matte work. Grace Kelly's and Ossie Davis' debuts. John Cassavettes, Brian Keith, and Janice Rule amongst the extras. Bel Geddes would be blacklisted till VERTIGO. 8/10
1471	Worst Yet: This is the first book of Grisham's that I had little to no desire to even finish. It is by far the worst book he has written to date.
1472	poor service: It is unfortunate that the dimensions for this product were not given. It does NOT fit all Canon EOS cameras and certainly didn't fit mine. There was no invoice in the box when it arrived. I called the company (after much research to get a telephone number) to get info to return the lens and was promised a return sticker by mail. That was almost a month ago and I am still waiting.
1473	Does not include antenna coupler: I ordered the MBC-15S-AC, and received the MBC-15S which DOES NOT have the antenna coupler.
1474	1 star is generous!: Some of Martin Lawrences stuff is extreme, but I was expecting some laughs out of this film. There was a 'tee-hee' here and there, but this movie was obviously trying to be a serious moral drama, as opposed to anything remotely funny. I kept waiting for the laughs, and they never came. This movie was the worst comedy I've seen. Watch something else and save yourself the pain.
1475	Avoid: The drive is adequate, it has conked out a few times, but generally comes back, BUT it takes a wierd y-shaped cable which requires TWO USB ports. My cable stopped working, and ordinary USB cables DO NOT WORK, despite what a lengthy process through customer service tell you. Then, to order a replacement cable, multiple calls on hold eventually takes you to a service center in some remote countyr where the operators barely speak english. After repeating all my contact and drive serial number etc info for the fourth or fifth time to a foreign speaking customer service person (and this after being on hold for nearly an hour), I have yet to hear back about getting a new cable.AVOID!!!
1476	DOA, twice: I purchased this item at a hardware store. I filled it with the recommended butane product, but it would not light. I returned it and got another one, which was defective on the other end and could not be filled. This is not all that inexpensive of a torch set, so I returned it again for a refund. I subsequently purchased the Blazer torch for silver soldering, which uses the much better triple-filtered butane fuel. Your torch will last a lot longer and won't turn itself into a flame thrower, which is what happened with my other Bernzomatic mini torch. I wouldn't recommend this product.
1477	VOIP841 Additional Handset: Excellent product. Lousy documentation. Setup was a hassle because the documentation didn't make certain steps clear. Once the proper procedure was discovered on the manufacturer's website it all came together. Love the product.
1478	Not Compatible With Windows 7: Be aware that Motorola does not have USB drivers for Windows 7. Also, I couldn't install the software using the CD ROM. My new Dell laptop has 1.9 GB RAM available. The install wizard said I didn't have the 32MB needed for install. This also happened with the 5120 model. Contacted Motorola, Dell and Geek Squad. None knew what the problem was.
1479	Very Disappointing: 7 Habits is one of my all time favorite books. The 8th Habit is one of my least favorite books that I have ever tried to read. How could the same author create both of these books?The 8th Habit is out of focus. The model he uses is too complicated to follow. There is no continunity in the book. Over 400 pages of disjointed concepts, charts, graphs, and quotes.Unlike 7 Habits, I found no practical application in this book. Very disappointing.
1480	Did everything I wanted except last for more than a couple months!: Look, for the price these are great expect that they're not made to last. I got a couple months good use out of them and then they started shorting out. I didn't do anything more than the normall stuff you do while walking around the city with your iPod. They're just not made to last. If that's no big deal to you then buy them. I, however, prefer to buy something that will last at least a year or two.
1481	Bogus Reproduction: I bought this in the expectation that it was a reproduction of an essay by Henry Wilberforce Clarke. It's clearly written by someone else (the author notes at one point that he/she is "indebted to H. Wilberforce Clarke's notes," or something to that effect, and there's no way Clarke would have thanked himself, would he? This is a very slender volume that has little of interest to anyone studying Sufism and mysticism, and is misattributed to an author whose work is now occasionally coming back into print.
1482	A Re-hash of old stuff: Waldrop's book is part of a widespread phenomena in business writing. Authors take some well-known information, in this case on systems and learning, repackage it and are hailed as "path breakers." There are a number of good textbooks that cover the same material much more concisely.
1483	save your money!: I have been buying videos and DVD'S for over 20 years and I have one simple rule when it comes to purchasing movies: If I already have it on regular DVD, the heck with the Blu ray version! The only Blu Ray movies I buy are movies that I don't own at all! When I converted over from VHS to DVD, it was worth it because of the widesceen format! You only have so much time in life to watch TV and your videos and play your video games! Stop buying stuff you already have! Spend your money wisely! Buy something you've never seen before! You might discover something else that's worth watching!!! However, if you don't own these movies at all, wait for the extended versions!!! Blu Ray is a gimmick and with the re-releases of all your favorite movies, it doesn't mean you should buy everything all over again!!!
1484	Opinions Don't Fall Here: This is a masterpiece of art. If you really don't feel this than your taste buds are roasted. There is nothing close to this. Nothing so save your agruements. Listen to it over and over you might grow your buds back. This is all fact by the way. For fully developed brains only.
1485	Pirates: Simple, consise and well written strategy guide for a very good computer game. Helped me immensly. I highly recommend this book.
1486	I use this book in my computer science class: I use this book to teach recursion in my introductory computer science class. We have "Computer Science Story Time", where we all sit in a circle and I read this book to college sophomores. It's a lot of fun. Interestingly, there is a mistake that the editors never caught: The animals don't fall asleep in quite the same order that the stories are told (corresponding to the stack frames being popped out of order). This just adds to the book's charm.
1487	Master of this genre: If you like Matchbox 20, Sister Hazel, Wallflowers, Vertical Horizon, or Fastball, you will definitely appreciate and enjoy Will Hoge's new album. He blows the Counting Crows out of the water.
1488	Perfect Pick-Me-Up!: I have to say the tracks here are greatly uplifting. When the day is getting me down and stressed out this is a perfect pick-me-up. The melodies are soothing yet exciting and the vocals/lyrics are amazing. Glad to have it in my collection. I have also really been intoWorld Groove Mix, Vol. 1lately...great album as well.
1489	Would love to own this..: I would love to own this album one day, this is the only Kid Rock album I do not own..but $200?! You are crazy..and it's revisited..I'll keep on lookin.
1490	I did not order...: I don't know where this came from. I did not rent this video on Amazon but yet it shows up, and says I have a 48 hour rental but it gives me 5 days?
1491	TERRIBLE ending: This book was "character heavy" - good heavens, I had to go back and reread several chapters to remember who was who. And, this ending is terrible - much too abrupt and insufficiently explained. I never did get exactly why she was killed!? After all the heavy character discussion, why not have a good ending telling WHY, WHEN, and HOW Violet was killed. And what did the dog have to do with anything? I was very diappointed and felt let down by the ending. Also, I'd have liked a little more detail about the lives of Liza, Daisy, and Tannie after the murderer was discovered.
1492	Faith in What?: This fourth book in the best-selling Left Behind series allows readers to watch the willful fracas between the evil incarnate Nicolae Carpathia and newly founded followers of Christ. Trib Forcers Rayford Steele and Buck Williams get alienated during the world cataclysm. As Rayford chauffeurs Carpathia around his empire, thousands of people begin to hunger for the Truth that continues to defy walls and boundaries. Two prophetic witnesses at the Wailing Wall stir faith for all the new followers. Chaos fervently builds as the world learns about an evil called the Antichrist.This was a book I reviewed for Tyndale House Publishers.
1493	A Must!: My daughter and I go for a walk everyday. She would get so upset when the sun was in her eyes, even with sunglasses on. This sunshade completely keeps her eyes protected. She is so much happier in the stroller now, and you have to love that this shade helps to protect sensitive skin from getting sunburned. I was a little worried that this sunshade would fit on our stroller. We have an all terrain stroller with a tray and I was worried about the shade fitting over the tray. No problem there though. This is such an awesome product. I only wish that I had found it sooner.
1494	the science of unoriginality: The Science of things. How long did it take you guys to come up with that brilliant title? This Cd is so bland and lacking of anything worth describing.I'm sick of all these power pop (crud)wanna-be bands out there that don't have an original thought anywhere in there brains. Avoid this useless cd at all costs. You'll be better for it
1495	Something's missing: I purchased this book in the hope that it would provide instruction to create the murals illustrated on the first few pages. Unfortunately, although there are very beautiful murals pictured,instructions are included for only a few. Perhaps my tastes differ from the authors but it seems that most garish and ugly murals were the ones that included "how to" instructions. It leads one to wonder if perhaps they do not want any competition in producing the more tasteful murals pictured! I also purchased the companion video and was disappointed for the same reasons- the instructions were only for projects I would not want to do.
1496	Julia: one great summer: When Colie comes to North Carolina to live with her Aunt Mira for the summer, because her mother, Kiki Sparks, exercise finatic, goes to Europe to tour, Colie thinks it is going to be the same in North Carolina as in her home town, but she has no clue. Colie starts a new life. She ditches her black clothes and horrible reputation to find her true self. This book is beautifully written! Colie thinks her past will haunt her forever but she is simply surprised. Morgan and Isabl, Colie's first true friends, help her to see who she really is. Sure they have rough spots but they "survive." I have to say this book is supurb. I recommend this book to people 12 & up because it deals with more complex problems and words that children may not be yet know.
1497	thank god it's a 'thrift' edition: I expected to really like Lindsay's poetry. I love Chicago and Chicago writers. Vachel Lindsay was a part of the "Chicago Renaissance" which included the poets Edgar Lee Masters (wrote the Spoon River Anthology, but I'm unfamiliar with his work) and Carl Sandburg, whose work I love. I had hoped with his association with Sandburg... Plus I had previously read "Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight" which is a superb poem. And "The Congo" has a great reputation. Lindsay's poetry just wasn't all that great--and I'm not saying that because of the performance pieces. I happen to like performance poetry, if it is well written (Marc Smith is a great example)--poetry is meant to be spoken. ... After all, he was part of the "Chicago Renaissance."
1498	Over thirty essays are contributed by experts: How are genetically altered foods affecting daily lives, and are genetically changed materials becoming a part of our genetic makeup through digestion of these foods? Genetically Modified Foods explores the myriad of issues and argument arising from the use of genetically modified foods, offering chapters which cover their history, science, and health concerns. Over thirty essays are contributed by experts in science, law, religion and public policy, making a guide which is packed with important observations and facts.
1499	terrible singing: No matter how many times I listen to this LP, I just can't warm up to her singing. She sounds like a typical 1950s pop singer. Her singing is marked with the irritating mannerism of bending notes without any consideration to the lyrics, harmonic structure or rhythm of the music. I suppose Beverly equates this to jazz improvisation. Beverly's supposed "jazz singing" is analogous to letting a 5 year old child drive in a busy freeway...the result a WRECK!!! Avoid this album if you want to hear jazz.
1500	great help: This is a great book. I followed it's advice and landed a job. I am so happy I read it before the interview. Great pointers, you only need to adapt them to your situation and personality. It's worth the try. You gotta get it!
1501	DragonLance? Yeah, I remember that...: This book is absolutely pathetic; no more than a cheezy spin-off of an otherwise classic series. Souless characters, no plot to speak of, and written in a style I'd expect of a third grader. Seems TSR will do anything for a few bucks now-a-days. This might be good if you're six...might. Avoid!
1502	More realistic movie than Cliffhanger and Vertical limit: K2 is more realistic and definitely better than the more successful blockbuster climbing movies such as 'Cliffhanger' and 'Vertical Limit'. This movie is shot on original location and has very few special effects unlike the other two. The story is also more believable. Unfortunately this movie was not marketed well enough because it is definitely one of the best climbing movies of all time.
1503	New? Really?: I purchased Dexter: Seasons 1-4 DVDs (described as "new") because I don't subscribe to Showtime, heard good things about the Dexter series and wanted to check it out. Although the series is interesting and fun to watch, the DVDs that I purchased are of low quality, skipping and breaking up in many sections. Obviously, this ruins the enjoyment of watching the show.Athough the Amazon price to purchase the DVDs is lower than if you bought them at a retail store, caveat emptor..you get what you pay for.
1504	Not the Best, but darn close!!!: Although, not as good as, JOB; A Comedy of Justice or The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, this piece of RAH's work fits into many of the other "Lazarus Long" stories. I kind of like the "Slideresque" feel of the book, as the characters move from Alternate Earth to Alternate Earth.
1505	Golfers Log: I have used the log for years. It allows you to evaluate your round and not depend on memory. It fits comfortably in your back pocket and using it quickly becomes a habit that does not slow you down. I find it helps me concentrate on the game at hand.
1506	OLD UNIT OR REFURBISHED: When I ordered the Tom Tom 720 the ad stated it was a new unit. I fully charged the unit after receipt and took it to try the next day, the battery lasted 45 minutes. Called Tom Tom customer service and told them of the problem and the service rep said I probably bought a refurbished unit under the guize of a new one. Also said Amazon has been known to do this. Well, I sent the "new unit" back, and was sent a refubished unit in it's place. It works fine.......The long and the short of it is I got a refurbished unit for the price of a new one. BUYER BEWARE! I will never order from AMAZON again.TomTom GO 720 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator
1507	scotch packing tape: I bought this 6 pack of Scotch heavy duty clear shipping tape that claims to be 20x stronger UPC 51131 86283 and it is totally useless....it will not stick to anything!!!!!I don't know if it was an old lot or if their quality control has slipped....but don't buy it....you have to pay to ship it back...very dissapointed ! I would like to add this edit.....after talking to Scotch consumer support, they will mail another 6 pack of tape and you do not have to return defective lot....they suspect the issue is the way it was stored hot/cold extremes....
1508	know what crap you're putting in your body: This book is excellent at detailing how the fast food companies target people, especially children, through marketing and other avenues, at the expense of people's health.It also explores the treatment and experiences of workers employed by this industry (which reminded me a lot of the book 'Nickel and Dimed').Reading about what goes into the food and how the products are processed, has seriously grossed me out from eating any more fast food. If you're trying to break the habit of eating too much fast food or drinking too much soda, definitely read this book!
1509	Freak of Nature Rocks!: One of the all time best episodes and a must for everyone that watches the "Winners and Losers" episode in Season 5
1510	"Mistake or lie" about the content on this DVD: the box of the "SHE-RA season two" says clearly "ENGLISH 2.0 STEREO - ESPAÑOL 2.0 STEREO" But the fact is that this seasons NOT include spanish lenguage! (...?)no DUB no SUBS...the SHE-RA dvds collection is Just one more incomplete serie for latin and spanish fans..what a Disappointment.
1511	Easy to use, but frustrating: I bought 4 of these sprinklers one month ago. As of today 1 works and the other 3 just spray in one direction and won't turn. I have called Orbit and they are sending me new heads, so we will see if they work after that.
1512	The Bottom of the Barrel: I have all of Junior Kimbrough's CD's, and think each one is a five star recording--EXCEPT this one. Fat Possum has a bad habit of releasing anything they have in their vaults, particularly if the artist has died (witness the awful--and accurate--reviews of Asie Payton's final album "Worried".) "Meet Me In The City" is a CD of cuts recorded at home, live at blues festivals--[heck], even in the shower, it sounds like. The quality of the recordings is [poor], and a couple of the songs you've heard before if you own all the Kimbrough Fat Possum releases ("Done Got Old" and "All Night Long," for instance.) For all that, you can easily hear the great bluesman Kimbrough was underneath the fuzzy background noise, sloppy editing & repetition. For collectors and purists only.
1513	review of RHPS soundtrack: Bless my soul, there's no "Sword of Damoclese" on the album. That's the start of a pretty big downer.
1514	Best CD I Bought This Year: This is hands down the best smooth jazz CD my wife and I purchased this year. If you are a keyboard lover, you need to have this latest Gregg Karukas release in your collection.
1515	The completely wrong item.: The item I recieved was not an ocarina, but rather a blue tambourine. I am thoroughly dissapointed with this and will certainly contact amazon about a return.
1516	Good product: Product arrived ahead of time and advertised. No complaints. What else can I say. It is a black extension cable.
1517	the little camera that could: I bought this camera based on other's reviews on Amazon that because of it's diminutive size, one would be more apt to carry it and use it. TRUE. This thing fits in any pocket or bag I could imagine, and it is easy to use, and it takes great pics up to 8x10 size. The only, and I mean, only thing I don't like about this digicam is it's ISO film equivilency of just 100.If you want an absolutely great point and shoot digicam, buy this camera. Also, I've used Kodak, Canon and Sony software, and by far I like the programs that come with this camera the best.
1518	Page turner: Excellent mystery, with interesting book notes thrown in. Ex-cop Janeway is a well-developed protagonist. This series of mysteries is always entertaining.
1519	Black Screen: I read about the problem of the black screen and also read there was an easy work-around. By the time I got the disc, the work-around was no longer among the reviews. Never could use the product. Guess I was forwarned, but for Amazon to remove the work-around from the comments is just plain mean.
1520	Encore: Gladys should have done this years ago; I hope she does more. she has a natural affinity for the American songbook.
1521	A fun historical romance: Cynthia Wright manages to draw me into the world of her well defined and diverse characters so that I find myself on the exhilirating rollercaoster of their emotions.
1522	Memories of Chewie: This kind of makes up for the terrible way Chewie dies in Vector Prime, but not quite. the only thing I personally HATE about this comic book is the way the author makes Princess Leia sound like a selfish brat.
1523	kevin anderson has got it down!: ole kevin rented this movie and told me it was "ishy". and that's exactly how i feel about it.
1524	The Coen Brothers actually disapointed me!!!!!: Let me just start by saying that I'm a DIE HARD coen brothers fan! I love every single one of their movies, except this on of course! I put this movie off for a long time because it just didn't seem like the Coen Brother's material to me! Finally I said what the heck and gave it a chance! I hated it from the start! The film's plot just didn't catch my interest and the whole movie is just too HOLLYWOOD for me! Others might like it though, because there are a lot of brain dead people out there who just love seeing the same hollywood plot over and over again. If you're a true Coen brothers fan then this film will disapoint you. Hopefully the Ladykillers will be better......a lot better!
1525	Part is great, Installation is a PAIN!: This part was exactly what I needed but it was a major pain to remove the old filter. I had to eventually spray some liquid wrench around the outside of the filter so that it would slide out of its retaining bracket. I also had to do this with the new filter as well. When it comes down to it the part is great but the installation is a major pain without using some sort of lubricant. This isn't the part's fault; it's GM's engineers' fault. :)
1526	A Real Surprise: I was pleasantly surprised by this cd. I picked it up on a whim and to my delight it is fresh and vital. I've never heard of any of these groups but that doesn't hurt the music. Most of the songs were recorded using either traditional instruments or with the addition of electric guitars. This cd, despite the cheesey cover is not overproduced tourist music. Instead it is delivers a nice selection of East and Southern African sounds. The singing and guitar work is great. The rhythms are awesome. Track four is killer. There is no info on the liner notes, but you can't beat this for it's price.
1527	Worth every PENNY...: Noticing some reviews that refer to the book as being outdated and too European...Being a Midwesterner in the US, I loved the book, particularly the info related to European holidays and songs. Perhaps it was my Czech roots that so related to that European feel. I purchased the book in '85 when it was advertised in Hearthsong and started numerous traditions with my newborn son. Tonight my 23 and soon (tomorrow to be exact) 24 year old daughter called to remind me of and request the traditional verse for the night before a birthday. Same verse I've read her the past 20-some years. Many other wonderful verses and stories and patterns that I've referred to over the years and my children obviously remember. This is one book I am definitely very pleased to have purchased back in 1985. Worth every penny. Priceless to me.
1528	nothin but love for this cd: Dave Matthews and all the rest whip it up on this cd to the max. Its a great cd, with all great songs. and its live, so it feels like you're hookin up with the band-live! all the songs are great, but #36 is one of my favorite. also All Along the Watchtower is a goodie. i totally recomend this cd
1529	My Son LOVED These Books!!!!: I have a 7 year old son who really only read when he was required to do so for school.That was until he started reading the Captain Underpants books. HE LOVES THEM!!!! When he was told it was time to go to bed he said "can't I just stay up until I finish this book". The next morning the first thing he did was pick up the book and finished it.Your kids (boys especially) will get a kick out of these books.It is so great to hear your kids reading a book and laughing OUTLOUD!!!
1530	JUNK!: I bought a spindle of 100. Maybe 1 out of 5 worked. what a waste of time If you can't put out a decent product, why even bother. Save yourself some frustration, spend a few bucks more and go with TDK Sony or Memorex.
1531	Not that Great: My 4 year old never plays with this doll. It's not that much fun. It should do more. All it does is cry (which it hardly ever does), laugh, make snoring sounds, and yawn. It's a cute doll but boring.
1532	Wonderful quality heavy Pyrex glass lid that fits all 9 1/2 inch pans!: This Berndes Tradition glass lid is the perfect lid: Heavy, thick, tempered, Pyrex glass that is easy to see thru, clean, or use on any 9 1/2 inch pan. Dishwasher safe. Not easy to find Tradition accessories, so grab it! Recommended!
1533	For Egypt Lovers!!!: Although this was a children's book, it was amazing! I am 21 years old and it captivated me really fast. I'm gonna admit that I am not much of a reader. But, I am very fascinated by Egyptian stuff. So, when I saw this book, I knew that I had to have it! I t was a great buy! Now I want the other books in the serie! It was a great book for children to read. But, if you collect books about egypt, this might be an interesting one for you to pick up!
1534	No reason to buy this lens: There's absolutely no reason to buy this lens when you can instead get the Canon EF 28-105 f/3.5-4.5. It's a faster lens with signiicantly better image and build quality, and is only about $50 more than this cheap plastic/slower version.
1535	all serious psychotherapists should read this book: This is basically a "how-to" manual detailing one of the few "empirically validated treatments" for major depression - i.e., a treatment that really, truly helps. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) is as effective as either Beck's cognitive therapy or antidepressant medications. Since every therapist encounters depression on a regular basis, how can you justify ignorance of this (short-term!) approach? The book is readable and well organized; someone already trained in psychodynamic psychotherapy could probably improve clinical practice based on the book along, though specialized training would surely be helpful as well. The approach makes sense to patients, too!
1536	Very Poor Quality Product: I recieved the Mini-Prep Plus as a birthday gift several months ago. Initially, I was quite pleased with it as it was just the right size for the small quantities of food I needed to chop up. Then it died on me...after only about seven or eight uses. All I used it for was chopping vegetables like carrots, onions, and bell peppers. I couldn't believe it. When I called Cuisinart customer service the best they could do to help me was try to sell me another one for half price. Why would I invest money in a product that has already proved to be a piece of junk? How many times would it work before it burned out? Don't waste your money on this product...look for a different brand with a better reputation and a company that will stand behind their products.
1537	do not buy: do not buy this product. it does not work.it makes the glue gummy and in our case, helped to spread it out making the floor even more sticky. our work is doubled!!aweful.
1538	Don't be tempted: I have to let you know that I was very disapointed with this video. I enjoyed the Temptations movie better. The tempo was too fast, the choreograpy was horrible. Otis must have made up those moves. I didn't expect the songs to song exact but if I would have had my eyes closed I would have had no idea who was singing.
1539	Very Poor Quality: Our eleven year old grandaughter loved this watch we gave her for her birthday. She loved the style and the color and it fit well. But, a little over a month later the digital numerals stopped working! This is the second watch I've bought from Amazon that died within a short time. The first(a different brand) came with no directions so it was impossible to set :( and while this looked great and came with directions, another watch that stops working after a few weeks is of no use. Guess I got what I paid for. Lesson learned--no more buying watches from Amazon.
1540	so bad...: what a waste of money....the first chapter seems promising but then the whole thing falls apart..as the book goes on his logic becomes worse and his writing gets sloppier...i stopped reading halfway through when he used the word brilliant to describe a "scientist"'s theory that people crash planes on purpose after reading about suicides in the news because they want to copy-cat suicide but they think it will embarrass their families . seriously. he says that theory is brilliant. ugh. what a nightmare....at least sixty pecent of his evidence for his claims is anecdotal evidence from his life, most of which evidence seems pretty clearly made up...in other words this book is a huge waste of time. don't bother!!!
1541	My Review: When I went to Toys R Us a few days ago the game was one of those tester games where they let people that come to the game section try it. I thought the game was pretty cool so did my sister and brother. My parents said they wanted to buy it as soon as it came out. i think the game teaches coordination and helps with reflexes.
1542	silly and crude: this movie was way over the top, disrespectful and a waste of time. I did not like it at all
1543	Please, repeat with me...: 1. Anacondas don't move like lighting on land. Actually they are very slow and vulnerable. It just made me laugh, not be scared.2. Anacondas are not evil things looking for every moving things to eat. Actually, they eat once and go sleeping to digest the prey.3. Oh, and besides, they don't have superhuman intelligence nor chase the prey. They are opportunists and wait for the prey to get close enough to be caught.Enough said.
1544	Wonderful Summary of Samurai history and equipment: This book is an excellent summary of samurai history, equipment and tactics. Of the Samurai books I've read, this is the best overall treatment.The author covers each major period with a general description of the history of the period. He then provides profuse illustrations, battle maps, photos of reenactors and surviving artifacts.It has the clear and easy to understand description and drawings of samurai armor. The photos of reenactors are really great. They really bring the subject to life.The historical narative is brief and covers just the basics of the complex maneuvering, diplomacy and warfare that was characteristic for this period. Hard core researchers will probably find this thin,. But for a reader interested in a solid overview of the period, this book is great.
1545	Packaging: The packaging was not good. The filter was sent in half a box and taped up on one side. Probably meant to be sold in a matched pair. But it looked hokey.
1546	One of the most EXTREME album's ever done!!!!: Remember ''REEK OF..'' well so did these Mexican's!!!!This is so extreme that it will cause sickness to those ''normal people'' which is good as they need to be destroyed anyway!!The album cover will send you running for the hill's even!!!If you ever wanted the kind of album that can really just destroy the world..here it is..in all it's head caving glory!! this has few competator's!!!The absolute soundtrack to HELL..and I dont even mind it in the least!! my version has the live song's to which are HILAIRIOUS..''HELLO MEXICO...BLAHHHERRRR(in death grunt's..sound's like a thousand demon's at once!!)PREPARE TO DIE!!
1547	Love it!!!: Really love this product. We were afraid of some of the previous reviews that talk about the horrible odor of this product. It does not have a bad odor. It is very well made and works great!
1548	Scatman Rocks: All right, anyone who does not like this cd needs to get his head examined. It's simply great. Scatman John is the best.
1549	Inception: This product was a Christmas gift for a close friend of mine. The price I paid for the video combo pack was a steal compared to the prices I found in local entertainment stores. Plus with this specific version of Inception, it includes a Blueray version of the film, a DVD version of the film, and a digital download as well. Also, the delivery day of the product was early which I appreciated since it was a Christmas gift. Most of all, the product I received was exactly what I thought I was purchasing; not misleading.
1550	Illegal software is what I received.....: FYI: Item was a CD that came with a previously owned PC, labeled NOT FOR RESALE. This was NOT software that the seller purchased himself but a CD that came free as part of a PC purchase. This was sold illegally. I'm just glad that my new laptop and Microsoft doesn't know this. While I am happy to have MS Works on my new laptop, I think it's wrong to sell something like this (although I won't have a problem since I have the proper key). (I had this happen before with an OS disc (Windows XP) I ordered (not knowing it was a mass production disc for a college) which ended up being useless on my work PC when MS Windows upgraded and discovered it. It put a big red flag on my PC which could not be removed until I had to re-buy the program with a proper key.) Buyers need to beware of sellers such as the one I bought from. See photo above for documentation!
1551	groovy: As i find the orginal the best and the rage: carrie 2 dumb the tv movie of carrie is nearly as good as the real carrie.What make it good is that this one is more to the book story line they have done a good job with this one.
1552	Copy protection issues: Due to the copy protection on the CD it will not play in most high end CD players, and will not play in any DVD player. I paid for the right to listen to the CDs music where ever and on whatever machine I choose, yet the record company wishes to dictate what CD players are OK for me to use. I will never buy another copy protected CD again, and I would not have purchased this one had the label of the CD indicated that the CD was disabled and wasn't usable in any high end systems. It would be a shame if others tried to use copy protection to limit the purchaser. The music probably is good, I just need to find a cheap enough CD player to actually be able to give it a listen.
1553	Don't buy this product: Used this product for 12 months and just received the H03 code. Tried to fix using recommendations, but didn't work. Total waste of money.
1554	Worse than Cussler: If you like Clive Cussler, you MIGHT be able to stomach this book...otherwise you're in deep trouble. Cussler's 2-D characters, Playmate-looking PhD love-interests , Flawless leads, and implausible plots are all here...but somehow even harder to take. I've actually been able to get through some Cussler books before, but this one was truly painful at times, and FAR behind even a fading Clancy.As other reviewers have mentioned, the glaring lack of basic research, idiotic dialogue, and cartoonish characters are really disappointing for a writer who is being prominently featured in the bookstores, and has some nice print reviews. That James Patterson and Nelson DeMille's praises are on the book is an embarrassment.
1555	just tricked no treat: one of the worst horror dvd ever came out since the attack of the tomatos bad acting bad script
1556	Useless: Did not adhere to dashboard no matter what we tried. I received a credit and got the beanbag dashboard holder that works well.Zero stars is not an option.
1557	Sugar Ray is a very talented band.: Their last cd ( Floored ) had acceptionally great songs. If you liked their last cd with the song " Fly" then you will enjoy their latest hit " Every Morning". The song has a nice beat to it that everyone can get into ( I did ). I recommend this cd to all of you Sugar Ray fans out there! If you liked their last cd then you will love their recent one 14:59!
1558	you only thought you knew history: As an evangelist, I thought I knew history as written in God's Holy Word, the Bible. This publication (all 960 pages of it) goes from the day of creation and continues all throught the bible. It is a must read for any bible scholar.
1559	Hoover H3060 Floormate SpinScrub 800 Review: This product has very little to recommend it. The attachments are virtually useless--they do not spin or scrub. You are better off purchasing hand scrubbers from Walmart. They'd be cheaper and occupy less room. The cleaning solution that is made for it is also worthless. It is possible to use tile cleaner instead (it won't damage the machine!) and this works better. I still have to use a hand scrubber in combination with the SpinScrub in order to get my tile floors clean!
1560	A great book. Worthy of anyones attention: Stephen Hawkins has out done himself with this one. Its a great book. The theroys behind it at some of the best I've read yet. The explaniation of his black hole theroys were great and easy to understand. Im a highschool Freshman and i was able to understand it, so anyone can!
1561	Ignore the Razzy nomination for "worst film of the year": But it is still a bad movie. A previous reviewer felt this installment was the final nail in the coffin. While a strong statement, it has some truth. I think Lucas now focuses on entertaining liitle kids in order to market products to them. He is no longer interested in making a good movie. This will be his downfall.
1562	Product needs review over long term use: this product seems effective in use to reduce and eliminate candidai am using this once every other day, alternating with another product which contains L. Spirogenes, the bacteria that inhibits candida.this product seems strong enough and effective enough to be used several times a week rather than every day.
1563	Do it like it's 1951: When businessmen were, um, men and occasional women.Chapters include: Art of administration, Nature of organization, Human nature in action, Democratic difficulties, Substance of administration, Personal power and authority in administration. administration as democratic leadership, and many more fascinating studies of humans in the office and how they interact without going crazy.223 pp, hardback, with index in the back.This review is for informational purposes only.
1564	Movie: I thought that this movie was great. i liked the book a bit but the movie is also good because i got to see the land in south america. it was a beautiful land. i want to see it again. hi people!!!
1565	SOED: I find the short edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, in particular the CD version, extremely useful. The only shortcoming is the following: for professional reasons I often use mathematical symbols, in particular Greek letters in equations. I do not know the correct English pronunciation of some of them; unfortunately they cannot be found in SOED either.
1566	Addictively oustanding: The first time I seen Orphen a friend had it. I did want to give it back. Orphen is magically addictive and oustandingly plotted.
1567	Chef's Choice 320 knife sharpener: I bought this sharpener after trying a friends Chef Choice. I thought the two stage was all I needed and I'm very happy with the purchase. Does a great job sharpening,very fast and easy. I highly recommend this model ands you can't beat the Amazon deal..
1568	A movie that is filled with wonder and laughs: I love it!!! You can never outgrow the Peanuts gang. It brings you back to those nights when CBS would broadcast Specials in Primetime, where kids would gather round and eat homemade popcorn.It's not only the characters of Charlie Brown, Linus and Lucy that keep you in hysterics, but Sally .. she steals the show. She's not only cute and loveable, but can whip out sarcasm with the best of em. I think she can even give Lucy a run for her money!
1569	Pathetic Anime: This is one of the worst animes out there that is available for purchase. The purpose of this anime appears to be to attract male viewers with poorly drawn-ugly girls who spend a lot of time in the nude. There is no story, the dialogue is crappy, the acting is bad, and the so called humor is lacking. ...
1570	PoD 2 Stars - Series 6 Stars and declining: I like many of you love the series, but am disappointed with PoD. One must admit the character development in the series is very good, but PoD did not enhance the series, it detracted from it. RJ seems to be generating quanity rather than quality.Mr. Jordan please get on with it!!! I only hope #9 is on par with LoC. I will perhaps wait a little longer before buying the next book or maybe check it out at the library.
1571	Great Radio: Stay away from the small Cobras in the same price range. With a correctly tuned setup, this radio works flawlessly. The RF gain feature is really nice and the PA option works great with my loudspeaker. Can't go wrong with this radio for under 40 bucks. If you ain't a trucker, this is all you need!! Thanks Midland.
1572	Brinkmann has a great web page to order parts from: Just wanted to say that I have used Brinkmann products. There was a reviewer that had trouble finding a replacement element for his smoker. Brinkmann has a web page of a big line of products. Replacement parts are there. Go there:www.brinkmanncorp.com
1573	Moose Mountain - don't climb it!: This is the second product by this company that I've tried. I don't think I'll by another. It is slightly better than the Dance Maker II I just brought home, because at least this one has music (if you can call it that). Both toys aren't fun in the least. They aren't reliable, don't ever give you the "grade" at the end of a dance (actually you aren't dancing, but stepping from lighted star to star like playing Simon), the batteries are ridiculously difficult to insert- I can't explain how awful this product is. Shame on the company for making it and Toys R Us for selling it. Don't leave your child in tears on Christmas morning. I knew I was returning it so I had three little girls come over and try it. They hated it too! "BORING!" they said.
1574	This is an insult to George A. Romero!!!!: This movie was soooooooo STUPID!!!!!!! Avoid watching or buying this movie. A true DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!! This movies ranks right up with Day of the Dead 2: Contiguma. This movie makes House of the Dead way BETTER!!!
1575	Piece of garbage!: This is the biggest piece of garbage around - the internal parts are the cheaprest possible plastic, they're way to samll for anything but an artist to paint, and the plastic things that hold it together don't work. Avoid!!
1576	Attractive, Well Made: I have bought three of these ,and very good looking containers..I have a label maker and under the lid i mark the name of the soap (eg. MWF, VDM, Omega). If milled soap grate into bowl, if hard made glycerin soaps melt into bowl. Everything looks neat, exclusive and vey easy to re-use. I will be buying again as I up my shaving soap stock.I am very pleased with these and there perfect..I hope this helps if you are reading this.
1577	Very poor quality for such a high price!: In addition to the extreme amount of background noise produced by this monitor, our receiver quit working less than a year after we started using it. The wiring started to short out, so we had to duck tape the wire in position in order for the receiver to stay on. A couple of months later it flat out stopped working (in the middle of the night, so we were unable to hear our daughter crying). I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone! If I could have rated it Zero Stars I would have.
1578	I want my menus back!: For people who have used Microsoft Office for the past 10 years, Office 2007 is hellish to use. On their Office Web-Site, Microsoft has put an animation that users may use to locate items of basic functionality in Office 2007. Click the menu item in an Office 2003 menu (menu - hmmm now that's interesting) - and an animation will show you where to find it in 2007. The fact that this is even necessary should tell you somthing. I don't want to spend hours learning a product I have used for the past 10 years - I have work to do.This product was not released to the public but rather inflicted on the public. I cannot in any shape, form or fashion recommend Office 2007 or Vista. These products are total assaults on productivity.
1579	Classic Keyes: The book though dealing with a serious subject was really funny. Keyes is a witty gifted writer. The supporting cast was great. It stirred up some feelings about infidelity but I liked that the ending was not cut and dry.
1580	junk: This product is even less than substandard. I tried to give it no stars. The plastic caps cracked and broke while we were assembling it-and there were three people holding it steady and level as we did so.Since I bought it at a home "superstore" that has declared bankruptcy, I am unable to return it. I would like to dump it on the company's front doorstep. I would still be out the money, but then I would feel like I made a point.
1581	Disappointed: This bubble machine does have one thing going for it. It shoots tons of bubbles, just like it says. But because it blows bubbles so quickly, it runs out quickly too. I've also found it difficult to use. It is difficult to refill and difficult to move without spilling all over the place. My older son loves the thousands of bubbles but my younger son is overwhelmed by it. I wish I'd gotten something else.
1582	Fantastic Four DVD: I am thoroughly enjoying this DVD. Brings back my youth in many ways. I was disappointed only in the fact that the manufacturer and Marvel Comics put a 'Marvel' logo across every page of the DVD comic pages to prevent copying as if someone would not be able to tell a mint forgery from an original in mint condition. The logo is almost a watermark as it is in the background but it is irritating to have to read the comic thru this watermark.
1583	Unhappy: I was really disappointed when she said every time I kick I pretend I'm kicking a cat...HAHAHAHAHA. I think it was in the 2nd mile. Since I am a cat lover and animal lover in general, this really diappointed me. I will not be watching any more of her videos.
1584	An Excellent Live Honky-Tonk Album: Paycheck is in fine form on this album. He cranks out all his hits and favorite tunes. I'm am a pedal steel guitar player and if you are another player or a big fan of the sound, you are in for a treat on this album. The steel duties are handled by Jim Murphy on this and he is in fine form. If you are a fan of Honky Tonk Country, you'll love this album.
1585	Still playing with it after nearly a year...: We gave this to my son on his 1st birthday in January, even after I read some reviewers complaints about the balls being hard to pound through. But I thought it looked interesting, so we tried it anyway. Yes, the balls are too hard for a 1 year old to pound through. My solution was to use a utility knife to carve down the small bumps in the ball holes so it was easy for him to pound them in with the palm of his hand. Mind you, this took me all of 2 minutes to do. He loved it then and he loves it still. He plays with this toy several times a week even after 9 months.
1586	Completely disappointing: When I first slipped these shoes on my feet they were so comfortable. Four wearings laters, the heel tip on the left shoe was gone and the entire top edge of the toe bed was scuffed on both shoes. The day I came home walking on the metal peg in the heel, those shoes went right in the trash. Should have sent them back.
1587	Can't Wait for #26, They Just get Better with Each Outing: Qwill thinks the Lockmaster Ledger is trying to pull the Moose County Something's leg....but the lead story about the diva turns out to be true and this leads Qwill, Koko, and Co into another thrilling adventure. Turns out, someone isn't who they say they are--and someone else is bound and determined that the cheater won't prosper. Bushy joins in to protect the diva and Koko is proved right, again and Pickax is going to get a real bookstore! A real Best-In-Show Cat book! Brabo, Koko & Qwill!
1588	Terrible: this book is terrible, it's confusing and lack of explaination, i recommand u to get the Linear Algebra and it's application by Davie C. Lay
1589	Get to know the man behind the mustache: A candid ride-along with Charlie as he attempts to take a holiday from the tramp. He charmingly shares his triumphs and foibles while skillfully negotiating his public and private life. A must-have for Chaplin collectors.
1590	Not what I had hoped for!: Lightly oiled it as directed. Now all it does is smoke in the over. I am very disappointed in this product.
1591	A must have for washing large area.: An absolutely must have if you are washing a large area like your sidings.With the extension, you can cover a greater area without moving. Just swing the wand back and forth instead of you moving back and forth saves time.The wand is not exactly light, it gets heavy after a while, so you will need to take a rest every 10 minutes or so.
1592	Perfect - Seems almost Current: Although this was written some time ago - in the 50's I think - it is more apropos even today. When one considers all the pseudo-science, fads, and utter ridiculous irrationality that has crept into "mainstream" thought, a book like this ia like a good stiff drink to refresh the senses.I have long been looking for a common denominator of wacky thinking and maybe Gardner has given the most plausible one - it goes against demonstrable science and is totally irrational. The Einstein was Wrong chapter was a hoot. I still smile thinking of guys trying to disprove Einstein with phrases like "he done gone and tried to make us believe all that stuff".The wacky belief systems are also dissected but one has to keep in mind that this is BEFORE the age of the Hollywood medium, the channeling of the ignorant or the use of ouija boards (Reagan) or crystal balls (Hillary) at the White House. A great book to read and reread.
1593	Great filter option: This filter is almost exactly what we wanted. After buying, and replacing, 2 Pur filters because they would eventually break where the filter unit connects to the faucet, we decided to try something different. The Culligan filter was incredibly easy to install, works great, and is an excellent price. I have no fear of one small piece breaking and turning the entire thing into junk - there is no flip switch to turn the filter on and off, and the connection to the faucet is very solid. There are only two things I wish were different - 1st, I wish it had an indicator light for changing the filter, and 2nd, I wish it came in a stainless steel option. Neither of these two things take away from the fact that this a great faucet mounted filter.
1594	Same Old Situation, Same Old CD's: I am a Crue fan and have been since 1986. I own all the albums and even have Too Fast For Love (Leathur). As you would imagine I've been looking forward to this CD for some time.How disapointed am I? It's just full of stuff that I already have. Where are all the rare tracks we were promised Mr Sixx? This is a rip off. If you don't own the Crue CD's then buy this. If you do then don't!!..and also not the best title for a Crue release given what happened to Razzle of Hanoi Rocks!!!
1595	You don't have to buy!: How sad that some man has spent a good portion of this year writing such silly drivel. To paraphrase Dave Chappellle, men would live in a box if they could get a woman to have sex with them. On the other hand, if you don't like what woman is offering you don't have to buy. Or find a woman that possesses values and has her own home and a career instead of a nice backside and a boob job. If you date women that trade sex for things then shame on you.You poor little boy, what's next how women force you to have sex with them?
1596	You can live at home: Surprisingly unspectacular for a Mission: Impossible film. I'd feel kind of cheated if I paid the evening IMAX price. The sequence in the tall building is impressive, but is only a short part of the film. The climax fight in the pigeonhole parking garage was done better fifty six years ago in a film that most of the people who saw it are now dead, called 5 Against the House. The plot seems like a mishmash of Thunderball andThe Spy Who Loved Me (James Bond Novels). The high praise this film received from critics makes me wonder ifCars 2is actually good.
1597	This is a must have!: If you have a bike and a 205/305 forerunner, this is a great product. I have multiple bikes, so I have a mount on each.
1598	In a million pieces: This cake plate was supposed to be a birthday gift. It was so poorly packed that it literally arrived in a million pieces. Since it was totally shattered, the recipient had to go to all the trouble to return it to Amazon. I am very disappointed!
1599	the worst yet: I could not even believe this was the same story I had read, well I guess that is because it wasn't. If this is not for a collection peurpose I would recommend not buying it. I can not even believe that someone would let a filmmaker destry there book like this. Does J.K. Rowling not even have anything to do with the movies? Does she not care how badly they are destroyed? And they are going to make the last book two parts so they can follow the story, yeah right, I want to know how they are going to get the crucial parts back into the story that have been left out!!! In credible, Terrible destruction of what was a good book.
1600	Praise for Diane E. Lock's "True Love": From its riveting opening sentence to its stunning conclusion, True Love by Diane E. Lock is a wild roller-coaster of a novel told in 508 pages of steamy, sensuous prose. Lock is clearly one of the finer writers of this or any age, and her influence on literature as we know it will be felt for years to come. The literary community looks forward to much more from this promising young Canadian expatriate. Mrs. Lock lives in Wellesley, MA, with her husband and her three children, of which I am the youngest. But I assure you that this has not influenced my opinions. -David Anthony Lock
1601	Waste Of Money: What a waste! These cd's are not what I thought I was buying. "Indiana Wants Me" is not done by the original artist. None of the songs are. It sounds like the person was on drugs or drunk. The original song has sirens. This version doesn't. I am not very happy. Very disappointed. PLEASE DON'T BUY!!!
1602	do not buy this product: this product is cheaply made and hard to use. after only using this item for several minutes it broke after dropping from 2 1/2 feet in the air , which clearly shows this is made with cheap,weak wood and is poorly crafted. in my opinion this product is not a good selection and should not be bought under any circumstances
1603	Your DREAM sewing room!: I had this book for myself and another friend was trying to figure out how to set up her sewing room so I bought it for her. It gives you all types of storage ideas, layout for ANY size room, etc. You can't go wrong with this book! Buy it for yourself and another 'needy' friend<G>!ENJOY!
1604	Awe and mystery: I maintain a great deal of awe and respect for the originality and production values of this series. I have never before, or since, viewed a series that so effectively captures the awe, the grandure and the mystery of being in space. If you are looking for bubblegum Sci-Fi this is not it. Space:1999 is as intelligent as it is artistic as it is original. At last a format (DVD) deserving of this spectacular series.
1605	Jarring departure: I found this to be a jarring departure from Iles' books where Penn Cage is the main character. I thought I had signed on for another interesting mystery, not a supernatural book. It was like an adult "Twilight." Blech.
1606	KINDLE EDITION IS WEAK: While this text is an excellent resource for the primary care physician, the kindle edition is terrible. There is no links or available table of contents, and extremely difficult to find a specific chapter as there is no guidence as to where it exists. I will change my review when a TOC is added (come on, this is a basic function of an e-book).
1607	An innovative but not so durable product: I found that this yoyo allows a novice to perform tricks such as walking the dog without too much hassle. Also, after 3 years of use it can still do this. It has help up well. I was able to purchase a glow in the dark version (white). It was pretty cool. See if you can find it at large retailers like target. I think it will probably be in place designed for children.There was one problem that I encountered. This Yo-Yo has the tendency to separate itself randomly. It is easy to fix--all you have to do is screw the two pieces back together keeping the string in line. Be wary of the places you use it, because it once broke on some floor and left a small scratch. I would suggest tightening it often.Anyone who wants to be able to do Yo-Yo tricks and enjoy them for long afterwards should purchase this toy.
1608	Amazing product: This product is absolutely amazing. I don't know why I waited so long to buy it.For those who've never owned a Braun brand before, it's one of the best brands available for kitchen-ware. Any Braun product I ever owned, lasted far beyond my expectations.PROS:=====- Very easy to clean(I'm "lazy", so when I say it's easy, I really mean it)- "Plug and Play"(I've owned one of those typcial food processor for 5 years, and have used it 3-4 times. It's just too much work, arrangement, and cleaning involved in using it, so I tend to opt for knife and cutting board at the end)- You don't need a large surface to operate it.CONS:=====- Honestly, none!I'm yet to see what a large food processor can do that this one, in spite of its size, is uncapable of.
1609	Works great!: Exactly same size as the original battery for my Canon SD400, yet MUCH LOSS COSTLY than buying a Canon replacement battery. Works great. Just took it on a two week trip to Europe. Took 200-400 photos and only had to recharge the battery once.
1610	Excellent: I bought this batter tender for my Kawasaki cruiser and it works perfect! I am also purchasing one for my dad to use on his harley.
1611	Far too short and redundant: Initially the game is impressive, but I found myself waiting for things to get hectic and they never did. This is the kind of game that needs 30 levels of increasingly complex tactical puzzles. Instead we get 11 missions that remain very similar intersected by cut-scenes whenever things get too interesting.
1612	Dissatisfied: The DVD was only for a specific region and would not play for us - luckily my daughter has an Apple laptop that we were able to watch it but unfortunately off her tiny screen.A complete disappointment
1613	foul smelling: Whenever I close to this thing, there is foul smelling (almost poopoo smell). Finally I found out it was from the flower rattle. This flower also bleeds dye when wet with horrible smell. I have no idea what kind of the fabric that they used for this toy, but awful!!
1614	Nice but itchy: I bought this, as well as a Slytherin scarf which I have worn more than once, but I don't think I will get much wear from the scarf because it will be too itchy for me to wear.
1615	Very Disappointing: The title is very attention grabbing. And Sherrilyn Kenyon is a "must buy" for me, and will always remain so. While I usually stear clear of anthologies, with Kenyon's name on the book, I couldn't resist.Romantica, no. Fluff, yes.
1616	50 ways of going nowhere with PE2: I really regret buying this book. It is supposed to be an easy tuorial well suitet to beginners like myself. Most of the examples are easy to understand, but I found the explanations of using the different tools somewhat variable. My main objection however is that only a fraction of the pictures used in the step by step tutorials are available ( and only as a download from the publishers website). Not being able to play around with the examples and follow the the author all the time made the learning process much harder. Why the author/ publisher has not bothered to make all the material used in the examples available I do not understand.
1617	Excellent tool for any astrologer!: Lots of information...easy to read...beneficial to any astrologer!
1618	A photographer's best pal: My absolute favorite camera I own. The first camera I owned too. Nothing can compare to the look of film, and the feel of this camera. Beautiful piece of engineering. If the model I own breaks I'll buy another, and another. I love this camera that much. Wouldn't trade this for any digital.
1619	Fast shipper. Product exactly as described!: Fast shipper. Product exactly as described! Would do business again with this seller!
1620	Why pay more for less?: Time will sell you the paper magazine, mailed to your home, for $25/year. Here you have to pay $36/year AND you can only have it on select devices (none of which have color displays). "No Sale," Time Magazine - get with the current age and 1) stop wasting paper, 2) give a discount for low-cost production and low-cost of delivery, and 3) open up to all Kindle devices.
1621	Very unhappy with product: I was interested in the gigabeat, since I did not want to have to conform to IPOD. The reviews were good. First problem is the battery life is advertised at 12 hours...try 6. I saw an article that said that 12 would be optimal conditions...my battery drains in 24 hrs if not plugged in.Next problem...one day, I plugged in and started and all memory seemed to get wiped out...after discussing with Toshiba phone support (very friendly and helpful), the firmware was no longer valid. Sent back to Toshiba and all was working. Less than a week later now, I just started up again and now all my info is removed again...this is all within a month.
1622	Great phone.: Have never owned a better phone. The gentleman that wrote the review with 1 star had a valid point though, you can't call back callers in the CID menu with an area code outside of yours (no option to put a "1" in front of the number). However his other point of not being able to turn off the answering machine is funny, because this model does NOT HAVE an answering machine! Wow. Its only an additional keypad folks, no answering machine. That would stand to reason why you can't turn off your "imaginary" answering machine. Also, I purchased three additional TCX905 handsets... also work great. All the features I need. Another small feature lacking, is being able to change the ringtone on the base. Overall though, you'll love it over ATT, GE, and Panasonic. I've had them all.
1623	lovely music: This was the first time I had heard of Beegie Adair, I just loved her music and intend to purchase more of her cds
1624	Broken after 1 use: The title says it all. I purchased this item, used it once, and it never worked again. I would not recommend this item to anyone.
1625	Guns N Roses ROCK!!!: This is actually the second time I bought this CD. The first one was loaned to a friend and she conveniently "lost" it she loved it so much. I have always liked Guns N Roses and my kids LOVE it. Plus, we are sentimental fans of "Welcome to the Jungle" since we lived in Cincinnati for a long time and it was the theme song for the Cincinnati Bengals as the games were starting. (I wish it would translate to them in their playing. Lol!) However, we LOVE this compilation of their greatest hist SO MUCH, that it was worth it to me to purchase it again. Thanks!!!
1626	Only received 1/2 of the kitchen!!!: This kitchen looks like it would be a lot of fun. Unfortunately, I was only set 1 or the 2 packages that contained the parts for the kitchen. When I emailed amazon's customer service, and was informed that they would send another kitchen out to me. I received the second kitchen and it was the same story, 1 package out of 2. I am so sad that I was not able to set this up for my daughter! I have now ordered from another company and two packages are on the way. Hopefully, I will be able to write a review about how wonderful the kitchen is sometime next week!
1627	TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE.: C'mon people! How fun is it to watch a racist, lewd, borrish, and dumb person beating up people for no (...) reason. As little as possible. All the film does is show two unorthadox sleep in car all night, hold up bars just because there are black people there, and reapeatedly getting the same food as 24 minutes ago. And a point that should go out, THERE IS NO CAR CHASE! Just someone chasing a train! I will end by saying that this trashy film deserved no oscars! BYE!
1628	Instructional Booklet: Very precise instructions on this difficult embroidery procedure. Beautiful patterns included and illustrated. Would recommend this book to anyone wanting to begin doing this kind of crafting.
1629	Clique is Great: Clique is really good. It's kind of like Mean Girls in a way, but of course different. I liked the book and really related to the girls. I think it's a good coming of age kind of book that we can relate to. If you have already read My Fractured Life, Girls On Film, and The A-List then this is a good one too.
1630	Daughter of Fortune: Easy transaction and shipping. Book in good condition. Haven't finished reading it yet so I don't have an opinion yet wether it's a good book or not but so far so good. Thank you
1631	if you want to throw away money,no choice could be better: First:who said that grind-core has to be only noise?that surely is what this japanese band is thinking.Every one could have made this album,since playing instruments without knowing how is what they wanted.So if you like listening to about 55 identical songs in about 25 minutes go ahead. growwtatatatbaaa:that is how it sounds.
1632	Bad quality: It arrived fast. Other than that it was a waste of time. I sent it back and will be charged $5.00 handling for that. Very cheap looking and some of the threads were pulling apart causing small holes in blanket before it was even used. Never again!!!
1633	Silly, annoying, fun...: Morgan Llywelyn writes in a colorful way, but I kept wincing as I read. The Celtic pantheon (shown here as being historical human figures) is reduced to hash: the author seems to have little knowledge of, or respect for, actual Celtic mythology. She also makes statements like "She rode on the horse's bony rump"--yeah, well, she doesn't know much about horses, either! (For those of you who don't know, the part of the horse you sit on is the back; if you sat on the rump, you'd fall off before it took a step.)This book has convinced me never to bother reading any of her other stuff.
1634	pretty good toy: This toy was a little smaller then I expected, but it was still a great buy. I really like that the activity part detaches.
1635	Very helpfull: This book is great for the beginner or intermediate woodworker looking to gain insight into the process of cabinet doors and drawers. Lots of photos and step-by-step instructions. Great suggestions on hardware, tools and techniques.
1636	Buy it: I've had a few different brands of these but this one actually works like advertised. You really can tear a sheet off with one hand without unwrapping half the roll. And it's cheap. Fine item.
1637	Agree with the "rip-off" idea: I have to agree with the idea that the studio is ripping off the consumer. I absolutely loved the movies and bought the theatrical then the extended releases. As eager as I am to have these in Blu-ray, I will have to fight the impulse to buy this release knowing that the extended release will surely come out probably shortly before The Hobbit is released in 2011. It is sad that the studio would not do what is right for the consumer (What a concept that would be!) Granted, they have every right to release their movies the way they want.
1638	what a stinker: This book was awful, simply awful. I like Diana Palmer, as a rule; in fact that's why I bought the book, to read about The Founding Father of Jacobsville. I wish I hadn't bothered. The wording was clunky and uninspiring, and even the other two stories by different authers weren't that great. My recomendation--don't waste your time. Choose something else.
1639	Go with Ferri or the Wash Manual Instead: Some of these reviews look suspicously from the author himself. A little too glowing to be realistic. This book doesn't offer what's been offered time and time again. Too many people trying to cash in on the fears of young medical students. The best book out there is by Ferri, followed by the Wash Manual. Don't waste your money or time on anything else.
1640	Lame art with half-baked story: If seeing Lucifer, Thor , Angels, demons and so on is enough for you , ok, but for me end of story was dissapointing and predictable, and pencils were AWFUL!
1641	Very US - and not very EU: Hmmm..a bit on the dull side. Although some funny numbers, the humour is somewhat sporadic. Also clearly targeted for the US listeners (not a hint of 'Monty Python-like' ga(g)s). The Xmas numbers are funny, although...The obvious 'soundeffects' are a bit monotomous...
1642	Waste of time & Money: Don't waste your time or money. Not user friendly at all, and does not offer a fraction of the options that other programs do. I own several Macs-as we are "Mac Addicts" in our home. I have tried this program as well as iScrapbook, Memory Mixer, and a few others. The program that I recommend is Memory Mixer. Memory Mixer offers a full version ($79.99) as well as a lite version ($34.95). If anyone is looking for an easy program to use Memory Mixer is it. It has designer papers/packs with embellishments etc. and is as easy to order products as iPhoto. There is no learning curve, use it straight out of the box. iRemember offers nothing to complement, and leaves you sorely disapointed.
1643	Number the stars!: A book that's been always in my mind, that I forgot the title of. I don't really remember in detail about this book, but during a vacation to Disney World in 2003, inside a hotel, I was on the bed reading this book, never abled to be put down, since I liked the character and the story itself. A great story that's been in my mind for many years, and 5 stars is definintely deserved of this work.
1644	Too cute: An acting exercise with some humor and interesting characters. But ultimately the story's weaknesses, especially at the end, kill the enjoyment. A poke at Fellini-like reality? A let down, when we hoped for more.
1645	Cheerful Reading: All of Alexander McCall Smith's stories of Precious and her friends are superb. This just continues a wonderful line of stories about Botswana.
1646	My favorite book ever!: I read...a lot, actually. I have a nook, and a kindle, and bookshelves full of paperbacks. I can't go to sleep at night unless I read at least a chapter. Out of all the books that I have read, Hidden Places is one of my all-time favorites. The characters are so complex and mysterious. You can't put the book down as you start to turn each page and the characters begin to unfold and the story slowly comes together. I highly recommend it!
1647	Not for 9- 12 year olds, much younger.: This book has only the most common of suggestions for anger management (ex: count to 10). It has very little text since each page is mostly a cartoon-like drawing. Should be targetted at a younger audience, not 9 to 12 year olds.
1648	Works better than the standard RAZR I had.: This phone I have had no problems with at all. I like the voice dial without having to record the names. This phone is much louder than the standard RAZR I had. I went through 5 standard V3s then I got this and it is great.
1649	SHANE: One of the BEST WESTERNS of ALL TIME. It truly is the movie that started the beginning of the good guy helps out strangers against the bad guys. Then rides off in the distance.
1650	not as complete as I'd like it to be: My 9yr old popped the DVD right in when it arrived. She's heard all my stories about how much I felt I'd learned with the help of Schoolhouse Rock. We watched and sang together. I think she got a kick out of it. Some of my favorites were totally left out! The 9's and 7's - 6's... were not in there. I assumed that since it was an anniversary editions that they wouldn't leave anything out. I was disappointed by that.
1651	needed book: I am very happy to have this book because it makes sense of all the basic graphics functionality, which is barely explained in the API docs. Maybe if you know graphics already you already know some things in here but I don't know 3D computer graphics and am having some fun learning it along with Java3D. I recommend this book for people in my situation. Since there are no other books I don't know what to recommend for poeple who already knows advanced graphics.
1652	Great pot rack, amazing price!: This pot rack was shipped quickly and when we received it, we were pleasantly surprised. The price is so much lower than anything we saw in local stores or other websites, so we thought we'd order it just to see what the quality was. Honestly, based only on the price, we planned on returning it. This is a great pot rack though, the quality is amazing and it's incredibly sturdy. We store our very heavy stainless steel cookware on it with no problems.
1653	John Masters - Loss of Eden Trilogy: Great trilogy set in England world war one. If you have read and enjoyed anything by R.F. Delderfield, try this.
1654	bench difficult to assemble: I was disappointed with the quality of the product and how difficult it was to put together. It was overpriced for what it is.
1655	Have had one for years: I really like ours. It has helped with having inside dogs keep the air fresh and clean. Once when we were remodeling the house, we moved all the furniture and our air purifier was moved and left unplugged for a few days. I did not realize how it effected the air for a few days and then when I plugged back in there was that fresh clean smell and feel to the air. I have no scientific test to prove what it does but I do not that nose and eyes smell and feel the difference when it is on.
1656	la mejor camara en su clase nada mas que decir: antes de usar esta camara estaba usando la 2100 tambien de sony, pues con esta en hd estoy muy contento con el precio y el performance de la camara yo voy a comprar otra
1657	Not as ordered: Although the blender works, it looks as if it has been sitting in the sun or was not finsihed properly. The colour of the unit is supposed to be white but it is cover in yellow blotches. As result it will never sit on my kitchen counter and only be brought when needed.2/10db
1658	Waste Of Time And $: I don't understand how anyone could like this book. I am stuck with the box set and can't even give them away. It is filled with characters with rediculous names and it doesn't help that they have terrible personalities. I can't swoon over a group of dudes dressed in leather and long hair. All I could picture by their description where a band of Megadeath roadies. Actually, I think I just insulted the roadies...This book was about lust and nothing more. No real relationships, no chemistry. (Isn't that supposed to be important for a paranormal romance?) I wasn't the least bit impressed and hope that I might have saved at least one person the the unfortunate experience of reading it.
1659	worst work book ever: this book combines the utter complexity of spanish with a kindergarden knowlege level and uterly failed, it's activities are not uselful especialy to those that are learning it is repetative and annoying. do not get this
1660	HORRIBLE!!!: This album was TRULY a waste of my time and money. I first heard Lois Lane on Trina's first album and she was tight. But this album is GARBAGE. Her lyrics are whack and she's NOT creative. I was hoping she'd come harder on this. So, Lois, keep waiting on Superman to come save you; 'cause you NEED someone to rescue you from this crap!
1661	HILARIOUS!: Oh my oh my, This books is incredibly witty charming and off the hook, it's so far fetched, and short you cannot help but laugh! I'll bring a smile to your face.
1662	jump starter: this product didn't work as i expected at all didn't hold a charge cables were so short as to be inpractial poor product an design
1663	Keanu heaves: What is the fascination with Keanu Reeves anyway? He can't act his way out of a wet paper bag, and he proves it again here. I'm so bored with his tired, brooding one-dimensional character that he portrays in every movie.I know! Let's give him an f-bomb in every line and rotoscope over the film. Shucks, that didn't work either.The fetching Mrs. Brew and I made it through about half of this sensibility bludgeoning before we gave up and smashed it to bits. I'm sure that the second half was just as stupid as the first. Besides, we couldn't find the tin-foil to make our hats.I know that some of you will say that I have no right to make this judgment without seeing the whole thing. So I'll ask you, if I set a bowl of poop in front of you with milk and a spoon, would you tell me that it's no good to eat before you get through the whole thing? And why would that be?
1664	Kipling Back Pack: After two attempts to purchase the back pack picture on the Amazon website, I was unable to get the back pack pictured. Originally, a Belgian company, I had started purchasing Kipling products while livingKipling Ridge Backpackin Belgium. They were great looking and sturdy items. The packs now being sent or available are the Kipling back packs with the Kipling patch the same colour as the pack material. In the past the Kipling products have had a contasting patch in black with the grey lettering. They were very stylish packs/products. No longer does it seem possible to get these packs/products with this styling.As a result, I will no longer purchase Kipling products unless we can find the products with the traditional patch that has been the classic Kipling look. The new look is not a good one. Very disappointing.
1665	Eleanor, First Lady of the World - VHS: I recently purchased this video documentary as a gift to my father (2012). He has viewed it at least four times and seen it once on PBS. He is a retired high school Social Studies teacher and loves history. He often comments on how much he enjoys this movie. I have given him several movies as gifts over the last ten years, but this is by far the one he most enjoyed.
1666	Don't bother: This book reads like something out of a freshman creative writing class. The dialogue is stilted, the plot is predictable, and the characters are utterly flat.Skip it - there are plenty of other good books by these authors.
1667	Why must you break? Why???: Our first machine broke within a month. Eventually, the company sent a new one. Now it's broken again, only this time the warranty is expired. Krups, I expected so, so much better of you. I wish I had read the reviews before buying this machine! If you're shopping, listen to the vast majority of the reviews and do NOT buy this one. It is my firm opinion that those who assigned higher than one star just haven't had it long enough--give it another year, and they'll all be broken and the owners coffeeless and (ironically) bitter.
1668	The View from a Reformed Christian Perspective: Otto Scott pulls no punches in his evaluation of James I of England (James VI of Scotland). Scott's writing is easy to read and fast paced, yet of a high scholarly quality. His solidly Christian perspective is unusual today. Look for other books by Scott. I recommend his book on Robespierre and _The Great Christian Revolution_. Highly recommended -- you will not be disappointed.
1669	Best horror show ever.: If you like horror stories this one is it. It keeps you going. I can't wait for season 3. I highly recommend this show if you like excitement.
1670	Naruto Fan: I bought the above-mentioned box-set for my grandson. He was very pleased with receiving the episodes and can't wait to get Vol 1 Season 2.
1671	Just Say No!: Princess Superstar is more of a novelty than a rapper.She really sucks.An article in the newspaper caught my eye when i read Kool keith was involved with this album so i decided to check it out.I must concur with the reviewer that called this tripe. I too enjoyed soundbombing but i did not care for this.Theres nothing innovative about this chick aside from the fact that a white female rapper is such an oddity.Leave this one alone!!
1672	THIS SUCKS: I THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOVIE IT REALY SUCKS ITS HORRIBLE DONT GET IT ITS GARBAGE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!
1673	NON-SUPORT: I have Polaroid 32' widescreen, and all the Digital channels are not compatible with the digital tuner that's in the TV'When I called product support, told me told me that LIFE IS NOT FAIR!!,neither is Polariold! that there was noting they could do.
1674	Not Silent!: I bought this thinking it would be a SILENT whistle. Guess I was fooled by the "silent whistle" description. It's not silent. It's loud, high pitched, and obnoxious. My elderly dad can't hear it, but everybody else I know can. It does startle my dog, but only for a moment and frankly it's not worth the annoyance to me or the neighbors.
1675	She Says it like it is: I really thought that the critical reviews that I read about this book were bunk. But the authors are entitled to their misguided opinions.I just loved that Ms. Fielding was brave enough to make the real life terrorists the bad guys. If only the Hollywood types that acted brave at the end could really be counted on to do so. I thought the book was funny, ironic in the use of typical Al Jazeera propoganda-and just when will some of the critics of this book wake up to the real threats in the world. Ignoring the threat is the REAL disservice to the victims of the terror. I think that everyone should "Stop, Breathe and Think".
1676	Carlys voice is as strong as ever: Although she sounds as good as she did in the 70's and 80's, the music selection is something less to be desired. I bought this CD in anticipation of hearing another great collection of her music. Yucko with a capital YUCK
1677	Not especially original...no sparkle: Was really looking forward to this, but am disappointed. Have been trying to finish it off and on for about six months but it never pulls me in.The writing plods and the storylines are derivative....not much original here.It's inoffensive--and certainly not awful--but nothing special. I imagine that the marketing prospects due to the author's young age drove the acquisition of this title by its publisher.
1678	This was a horrible book: I am a college student that was forced to read this by one of my professors. I loath this book and so does the rest of my class. This book is completely unnecessary to readand I have not gained any knowledge whatsoever from it.
1679	Terrible product: This is the worst product I EVER ordered from MS!! I give it one star only because this format won't allow me to give it a ZERO! It rewrites my harddrive every time I try to install....it tells me I must have the newsest version of Internet Explorer.....WHY.....it's a photo editing program!! Not a webbrowser! I have purchased two different versions of this....at Best Buy....which I might add will not take it back!! NICE POLICY..... I am a 54 year old woman who does not pirate software! I just want somethng that works as well as the old version....which was 2000 and somehow disappeared from my computer....and WHY does MS feel it is necessary to tack on IE to a photo editing program???Please let me know if anyone else has experienced these problems..I loved the old version and wish I could replace it!
1680	From a Father: Tom T. Hall may be the Story Teller, but Jimmy Dean has to be a close second. In fact, while Hall's story's most often make you laugh, Dean is the one who really gets to the "heart" of the matter. As the father of two little girls, "TO a Sleeping Beauty" has a very specail place in my heart and puts a lump in my throat. THe other songs are great too, but for a father of little girls, nothing hits me like that song.
1681	A book light years ahead: Carl Sagan really belived that the universe was full of wonder and this book explores all that and much more. The people who search for alien civilizations in this novel also search for the meaning of life at the same time. Sagan has taken his rightful place alongside Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury as among the best contributors in both science and science fiction.
1682	Poor Poor Sound Quality: I had gone through a few XLR cables that would start off good but the internal connections would break after a while. So I bought this Monster cable after reading the mostly great reviews on Amazon. I regretted it. The sound was dull using this cable. The dynamic range was gone and the vocals were compressed. I could not believe it, so I connect an old cable in the same setup to do A-B comparisons. The cheapo cable was bright and crisp while this was dull and uninspiring. I never used to believe a cable could make such an audible difference, but this cable proved it. I repeated the A-B comparisons for about 5 days just to be sure and then returned it. Monster has always been talked about as being overpriced and under-performing but I did not believe it till now. I will not touch monster stuff again. I suggest you do not take a chance either, and buy something nicer for the money you will be spending.
1683	tarp: This is a tarp to cover part of a swing set. It is a cheap plastic material. It rips and deteriorates every year and has to be replaced. I don't want my yard looking like a slum, so I have to buy one every year.
1684	Play with friends: This game is great if you play with your friends. If you watch this game played at the competitive level you will notice that only around 6 out of the 52 characters are used. Playing with people at the arcades (and definitely against random online people when it re-releases) will have you frustrated playing against overpowered teams. If you play against friends who agree to use the other characters then this is when the game truly shines. The sprites are great and will only look greater in HD. This is definitely an awesome title.
1685	One of the best poker books I've ever read: This is a book that will open your eyes. If you play low-limit hold'em with any kind of seriousness this book is absolutely must-reading. If you've read Lee Jones and wonder why you don't seem to win all that much...this book will explain why. One reviewer said that this book was the new bible for limit hold'em, and he was absolutely right on.You don't have to read this book, if you don't want to. But you will lose to those who do.
1686	My Pet Octet: Mendelssohn's Octet has always been one of my favorite pieces of music. The Kodaly Quartet brings forth the wonderful spirit of Mendelssohn in the most popular first and last movements. However, I think the group conveys a special grace and beauty to the second movement, too. This CD is a "must have" CD.
1687	good product: It's a buck knife so it is made really well. I prefer my first model better because you can just flip the blade out with your thumb. This one I have to use both hands to flip the blade out which is not as convenient, but I suppose safer...other than that, no complaints!
1688	The Kobayashi Reveiw: Alright, I might not have much to say about this but I do have to say that out of all the headsets I have used this one is the best. The sound quality from the headphone part is very good. Good volume control that can easily block outside noises, and can be worn in another way in case I want to listen to something else. Also the sound quality of anything I record is very good. It doesn't pick up any sounds other than ones made by me which is very good when recording for voice over, or singing. Also it doesn't hurt my head unlike some other head sets I've used in the past. So this one is worth the price. So I highly recommended it. However I never actually used it with lifechat though.
1689	Excellent pellets!: I get incredible accuracy from these out of my Webley & Scott Vulcan springer. They're consistant enough in shape and weight that I can't notice any difference in them when I shoot out to 35-40 yards. I use the gun mostly for rabbit and squirrel hnting and I haven't been disappointed once with them. I'll buy these til the gun falls apart!
1690	The turtle says it all!: The turtle says it all. This anthology brings Cuba to the eyes of its readers, in many forms and colors. It portrays the beauty of Cuban imagination while introducing it readers with an array of authors. Voice of the Turtle is the perfect book to introduce people to Cuban literature.
1691	Blades create windmill-like shadows on ceiling: While we love the appearance of this fan (the wood is very attractive with the darker metal trim) and the fan runs quietly and smoothly, BEWARE that the glass of the light kit is open at the top, meaning that the light shines upward onto the ceiling. When the light is on and the fan is running, you get shadows on the ceiling of the spinning blades. It's VERY distracting and hard on the eyes. Think of the people who live in the shadow of a windmill, it's that sort of effect. I read reviews on this fan before purchasing, and I can't believe no one mentioned the awful spinning shadows. It's especially bad as the evening gets later and there is less natural light in the room to diffuse the shadows. I would not recommend this fan to anyone, as the spinning shadows on the ceiling are just awful to live with.
1692	Its Garbage: Piece of artificially flavored garbage. Good teas are made by celestial seasonings and tazo. Not bigelow.It does not taste like raspberry
1693	What's The Secret?: If you went inside a secret garden, what would you do? The book The Secret Garden, by Frances Hodgson Burnett, is about a sour little girl who finds out about a secret garden that has been locked for ten years. She's also curious about some mysterious noises she hears at night.I enjoyed the author's imagery in the secret garden. I liked the suspense of the book. The fact is that I want to read more and more. It was just a great book. I loved it!I wonder if there is such a thing as a secret garden? I think the author was trying to tell us that sometimes things that you think can not come true really can! You should never give up! You should always love, share, and care for others!
1694	Flip video camcorder: Overall the Flip was easy to use and very compact. However the sceen was hard if not impossible to see in bright daylight. Batteries quit prior to using up the 60 minute of recording time.
1695	Battery doesn't last long - would not buy again: This product is OK when it works but I bought mine in October 2005, open a few cans a week and store it on the charger constantly and the unit is dead in less than one year. I will go back to a bigger unit with a cord and I will be much happier.
1696	Negative Stars?: There is a reason this book is less than $0.50 used. At best this is a lame attempt at humor, at worst it is very offensive, which is a shame because it is a good premise. Its assumations fall under the heading of misery loves company. So if you are looking forward to a miserable pregancy join their club. But please, for heaven's sake do not give this book to anyone, not even as a gag gift. I am speaking from experience!
1697	pretty dope: this disk has a few good songs but there are also some crappy songs as well. but for how old he is this disk is pretty good. enjoy yourself is a great song and boyz 2 men is also dope.CYBERSK8
1698	rip off: THIS PRODUCT IS TOTALLY NOT WHAT I ORDERED. THEY MAKE YOU SOUND LIKE YOUR GETTING 25 DISCS AND THEN YOU ONLY GET 5 DISCS
1699	BORING ISNT THE ONLY WORD THAT DESCRIBES THIS GAME: NOTHING NEW HERE IF YOU HAVE THE ORIGINAL AND WANT TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS DO
1700	Too Basic, Not worth the money: As a long time crafter and fabric artist, I found this to have precious little new information. I expected more from this DVD.
1701	IN DEFENSE OF THIS SCOOTER: Reading the BAD reviews had me worried...But after easy assembly(just put the handle bar on) & many hours of enjoyment I have to say they must be written by the compeditors more expensive scooter people. I weigh 220 lbs & this scooter performs just great. My son & daughter ride around the block, over speed bumps,up hill, etc...& keep going(trying to wear the battery down)for hours of fun. I bought 2 scooters to use on the job...looks like I'll need a couple more. Thanks !
1702	There's better paranormal romance...: I love paranormal romance and based on the amazon reviews thought this would be a winner. Master of Wolves was a fast read, but I didn't find myself drawn into the story. I expect complex, developed characters where the reader becomes invested in their story and outcome. This book just didn't do it for me.When the author started explaining the background mythos, she totally lost my respect. I have a pretty vast willing suspension of disbelief - but Merlin being an alien? Arthur is a vampire? I actually laughed with disbelief and had a hard time forgiving it. Granted, this is the fourth book in the series, so perhaps it would feel more plausible if I'd read them first.My suggestion - if you're into werewolves skip this one and read "Killng Moon" by Rebecca York
1703	Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right: Ms Coulter is a credit to the conservative right. Those subscribing to the conservative right must certainly embrace this work and this author. After all, she employs the same logic as those who fill the ranks of this ideology: Promote belief over facts and empirical evidence, and engage in non-stop rhetoric so that listening is ultimately impossible. As a person who leans to the left, I am so very happy that this author is embraced by the right. I must admit that I read only the first 100 pages of this book--my stomach could not possibly tolerate any more. I am anxiously awaiting winter to see if I can find an acceptable use for this book--I hope my fireplace can digest the pages better than I could. Thus, if one has money to "burn" I strongly suggest this book for cold winter nights with the lights out.
1704	One big bomb: What a dud. Love Empire Earth. Still play it. EE2... Doesn't even come close. More like rise of nations (which I hate too).They didn't even include their classic "all your base are belong to us" in it. If you want a great game, get EE1. If you want to try EE2, wait a few months and pick it up for a song. Trust me, you won't be sorry you waited.
1705	Comprehensive photolog of Virginia prodigy houses: There are many books out there dedicated to plantations in Virginia. This one stands out for two specific reasons.First, the catalog is wonderfully comprehensive. The author has done a fine job bringing almost all of the well-known landmarks to this volume. Second, the book contains some really amazing aerial photographs of the sites that we don't usually see, many of which are full page.I would definitely consider this book more of the "coffee table" variety than a work of architectural history. It's a big book intended for leisurely browsing.
1706	A Great Read: Although not strictly a book about either the Police or Sting the links to both are fairly obvious. Ian "Coolbreeze" Copeland's autobiography is well worth buying. His experiences of growing up in a (let's be honest) unusual family situation, of serving in Vietnam, his time as a road manager and the ups and downs of booking agency are all recounted and hold the interest consistently. There are two specific chapters on the Police - one on the early US tours and one on the Shea Stadium show - and many other references to them scattered throughout the book. Buy it - you will definitely enjoy it!
1707	My son loves this book!: We were looking for an introductory book on 4 wheelers and quads. This was exactly what we were looking for and our Son Loves this book!Teaches common terms and part names. Informative and Fun!
1708	excellent guide: This book is a great value for the plethora of info it provides. The directions and maps and advice seem very accurate, and you can tell these authors love to snorkel. Their snorkel book for the Big Island is also excellent. There is a little inconsistency in their "ratings" (eg, "good" vs "excellent")for the same snorkel sites in various parts of the book, but that is okay with me, given that conditions can change wildly from day to day anyway. A terrific addition to the travel bookshelf.
1709	It sux: Come on people. Want a true fighting game, buy Dead or Alive2. This game is not even worth 1 star. The graphics are terrible. When youplay it, it seems like you are playing on a SNES. What did you buy your Dreamcast for? To see graphics from 10 years ago. Please people, be smart. Don't buy this game. Don't make the same mistake I made.
1710	An OK CD with a Very different sound.: Mann lacks diversity in his music. After listening to the album serveral times each song begins to sound like all the rest. However if you looking for a sound that can't be found anywhere else this is the place it's happin'.
1711	A product that should be better known: I'm surprised how few Thomas compressors I see in the hands of builders, as Thomas not only owns the patents for airless compressors, they're one of the biggest and best compressor makers in the country. Thomas machines are the standard in applications like air brushing and medical compressors and aspirators.I bought my Thomas after reading a comparitive review in Fine Homebuilding, and I wasn't diasppointed. Build quality is top notch, and the machine is suprisingly quiet in operation. This pancake unit is ideal for a finish carpenter or two. Put it in the next room and you'll hardly notice it kicking on and off.
1712	Top book to have on bookshelf.: The first day I read the book I tried some of the concepts.Specifically Belief and Expectation.This may sound like science fiction... but I was able to induce a particular outcome in certain situations.The neighbour was playing music loudly and through the techniques taught I willed the music to go away.Within 2 minutes the music completely shut off.Other occurances like that have happened when trying these new mental approaches.This is a very short breath of what is covered in the book so just imagine the possibilities out there.However,this stuff definitely requires descipline and a strong mindset.I know what you may be thinking... that it could just be freak occurances,but ask yourself the question, do coincidences even exist?
1713	This one is awesome, must buy: The reason I bought this camera, because it has extra high sensitivity (ISO 3200 and up to 6400)which is a very nice feature. You can take a picture in a low light condition and without flash light. I know the flash light is ganna hurt my baby's eyes and I don't want to pay a big bucks for SLR. It has done very good job so far. I like everything about this camera. I think this one will fit you whoever is going to have a baby.
1714	Not for jewerly: I bought this set for my husband to remove links from his new watch band. The description says "Jewelers" set, but the packaging says "Electronics". They are too big for jewerly use. It is probably a good quality set, but I wish the title for the item matched what it really is.
1715	Useful training tool: Heavier and more rigid than the tanto version but has the benefit of an integral hand guard. The paint cracks and peels quickly so it gets ugly fast. Other then that it's well made and lasts under heavy use. I've had a half dozen of these for training classes and they've held up perfectly for almost five years now. They bend but don't break, hit hard enough to tell you've been struck, but don't leave any lasting injury though they do have a tendency to leave welts with heavy impact where the lighter tanto-style knives do not. I strongly suggest avoiding head shots or wear appropriate protection. Great value-priced training tool.
1716	Highly fictionalized memoir, not even very good spy story: "However, none of these authors could match Aline, the Countess of Romanones, who, between 1987 and 1994 published four books, The Spy Wore Red, The Spy Went Dancing, The Spy Wore Silk, and The Well-Mannered Spy, recording her involvement with espionage, beginning with Operation BULLFIGHT in Spain at the end of 1943. Although Alines (sic) had served as a cipher clerk in Madrid for the Office of Strategic Services, her supposedly factual accounts were completely fictional. "(West, Nigel. Historical Dictionary of Sexpionage. Scarecrow Press. 2009.)
1717	I couldn't put it down: I am a big fan of the "Prey" books by John Sandford and this book was as good as any of those. I was thoroughly engaged by the story and read deep into the night. I was breathless at the end and never suspected who the killer was. I absolutely recommend this book!
1718	Good handy stuff: Handy stuff -- does its job well for $10. Also the design is good so you don't need to worry about clip springs getting loose, etc. Thumbs up!
1719	Not a pleasant sound: I wish I loved the Plan Toys concertina as much as I love their drum or the adorable pull alligator toy. But oy. It just does not produce a single pleasant sound, which is especially ironic considering the product description claims quite the opposite ("Plays Pleasant Sounding Notes") - hmmm...hardly. I'm not even sure we can claim it makes more than a single sound, which is one identical to a police car's siren.Giving it two stars if only because we still play with it every once in a while, and it remains part of our young toddler's music instrument collection (along with the above-mentioned drum, a glockenspiel, a guiro, etc.), but probably just for novelty's sake. It would be lovely if this were reworked so that it actually produced anything that could be remotely called "music."
1720	Instant Spelling Dictionary: Our old copy was falling apart and we were very happy to be able to replace it.
1721	review from Synthesis: Hey, Matador! One Interpol is enough! With such a diverse number of bizarrely talented groups, it's baffling why such an established label would put out a band such as The Double. While Loose in the Air isn't a horrible album, frankly, it sounds like a collection of experimental Interpol covers. Upon hearing the scratchy, deep vocals of David Greenhill, one could see why such a comparison takes place. And while most songs are washed over with spooky, at times distracting, vox and Casio lines courtesy of Jacob Morris, almost every melody recalls a sense of deja vu. The epic "What Sound it Makes the Thunder," with its climbing keyboard lines and feedback, almost makes one eat their own words, until the next song starts.- Nick WalkerSynthesis.net
1722	Wah, wah, waaaaaaaahhhhh.: "Had Enough" is a book written By James Carville. Have you ever seen or heard James Carville on TV or radio? He is possibly the most offensive childish man you will ever see. He throws bona fide temper tantrums over the silliest notions. He stands with both feet on the weakest arguements and screams his FOOL head off over ridiculous nothings. I understand he has to make a living and apparently being an obnoxious horse's rear end pays dividends in some circles, but otherwise there is no explaining the amount of angry bile this man spits out whenever he's handed a microphone. I have sympathy for all the people in his life who have to endure this repugnant creature.The good news is: we don't have to. Don't read his book, don't listen to him on TV or radio. Turn this sad little man off before he makes you as unhappy as he is.
1723	Just meh, nothing overly special: I had such high hopes for these but, as another reviewer noted, they taste no different than store-bought maraschino cherries. As an added bonus for the store-bought variety, you don't have to wait very long to enjoy them, whereas these will take a couple of days to be processed and even more time before they arrive at your door.
1724	Photo request Email Correction: My apology,Please send requests for photos to NorthGuy13126@aol.com.Thanx.- Joe C.
1725	Tom Waits and Frank Zappa get drunk and join the circus: Give each song a sample, if you like music that holds your attention, and is complex without the pretention, then you WILL NOT BE LET DOWN. Sure, their small time, but don't turn your head just cause the guy who likes all the music you like hasn't heard of them. These guy's (and girl) rock, and if you get a chance to see them live at a local Pub, Jump to it! Be the first on your block to show off the band that will either change the world, or confuse the hell out of it!!!!!!!!!!
1726	A Great Book!: This book, with only a handful of words, was the first favorite of my son - 1 year old. It allows you to make up the words as you go, so even an older sibling can "read" it to the little one. My son never climbed out of his crib, and I wasn't disturbed that the dog watched the baby for a short time -it's just a book! He actually took better care than many babysitters would! :) My son loved the fun pictures, and could relate to the baby "oh oh, messy!" when he saw him spilling food on the floor, or jumping on the bed. An excellent book if your child loves dogs and mischief! Even without the words, this book taught how to talk. It's still his absolute favorite!
1727	don't buy this phone from verizon!!: this a good phone for those who are interested in listening to music. also a bluetooth and java/brew provide ability to download new applications. however the verizon blocks download of free ring tones and java games/applications from the internet ( you have to pay verizon for every game) thus severely limitng the usefullness of the phone.boycott verizon!!!
1728	I Forgot !: I watched this series when it first came out and I had forgotten how great it was. There isn't another show to compare with it.
1729	love it... easy to please: farting, smoking humping... I love it all. I like Family guy and south park 90% of the time. I saw this 3 times in theaters to show my loved ones and bought the Blu-Ray combo pack for the extras and so far I love it! Making of was awesome nd the combo pack lets you install on up to 10 devices!!! watche the mkaing of and all bonus features!
1730	great movie: nicole kidman played this part sooo well. what a boring life these poor women had to live. its always nice to have some type of quarrels between couples - how else are they going to kiss and make-up.
1731	Nothing more than a platform for a vegan and polictal tirade: I was so angry when I was done reading this book I wanted to return it. #1 it has nothing that I could feasibly apply to my life, except maybe cutting out diet soda. #2 it made me mad that they go on and on about the meat and poultry industry and the corruption of government. Nothing more than a platform for a vegan and political tirade.
1732	My first disappointment with a vendor: I could understand if an item was out of stock...as long as I'm informed of that. But my order was for a set of 4 and only one piece was sent...no explanation. When I went back to Amazon to see if I ordered the correct item, the item description said that it was out of stock and availability not known. Customer service at its worst.As far as Amazon goes, I have to give their customer service props for the prompt refund and paid return address label...customer service at its best.
1733	Early Days: Has it all! well almost: This single CD is a compliment to anyones collection. With songs such as Black Dog, Dazed and Confused, and the well-known Stairway to Heaven. Just toss it in your player and you get over an hour of pure Led Zeppelin. However it is lacking some of the deeper tracks which happen to be my favorite. I have all of the released Zeppelin albums, but lately I've been using this CD more. Its just so easy to toss it in and get a variaty of their sound. My opinion is that if you're a hardcore Zeppelin fan like myself than you will love it. Lets just hope Volume two is on its way.
1734	Pretty Cool: You mission bring the Digimon back to File City, problem, most of the Digimon FORGOT about the city and have gone wild. You have to train and fight your Digimon so that you can get to different areas and DigimonThere are a good variety of Digimon and your Digimon won't digivolve the way it does in the show. I liked the game alot, but in many ways it's like a glorified tamagotchi. But it was still fun
1735	Sorry James: While I am a long-time fan of James Randi, this book was tedious (at best). Unfortunately the author goes on and on ad infinitum about subjects that really don't hold the readers interest. While it is very demonstrative of factual evidence, the chapters drag on as though the reader needs to be convinced and then reconvinced of the evidence. Each chapter seemed devoted to proving the obvious frauds (over and over) to the point where I was exclaiming "Alright...I get it...now let's get on with it!"
1736	Chris: I purchased this gift as a Birthday gift for my friend. I was never a Noah's Arc fan but I must say that this movie was enjoyable and had both of us in stitches. I would recommend this purchase for anyone who just want to seat back and enjoy a good laugh.
1737	Don't buy if you like the previous Final Fantasy games!: I have never been so disappointed in a game. This is nothing like the previous Final Fantasy games! It has little depth and very little options. The worst part is that you can only really play one character at a time and that character is set to auto attack. They should have just made this into a mini anime movie and not worried with the fake game portion. I agree that it is beautiful graphically but who cares when you have no control what so ever.
1738	So unaccurate it could be dangerous.: This Thermometer is as inaccurate as you would expect an analog to be. People who say its amazing probably havent had the chance to compare it to a digital one. I've chucked mine in a dark corner after a couple weeks of use when I saw a pretty cheap digital one.Decent digital thermometers sell for as little as 8 pounds and are far far more accurate and far quicker to respond. Dont risk your reptiles health, spend a tiny bit more.
1739	A Curiosity: This brief sketch, though emblematic of Twain's style, was designed only as a private joke among friends. It was printed in very limited quantities during Twain's lifetime, and it seems doubtful that he ever ascribed any lasting literary importance to it.To me, the sketch is too short to represent a highly developed literary endeavor. Also, it isn't very funny, with its childish scatological humor.This particular printing includes some interesting, though poorly organized addenda. It is printed in a bare-bones, desktop publishing format.I would not recommend it to the general reader. It would be marginally interesting only to the Twain scholar.
1740	Best Australian book I've ever read: I couldn't put it down, I felt I was actually present in the story. I loved all the characters, and the setting and locations were described beautifully. I'll read it again and again I'm sure.
1741	Disappointing Read: I found this book more irritating than anything else. First the history is grossly innacurate. After reading the Masters of Rome series, learning about the time of Marius and Caesar have become a hobby for me. I was delighted to find another book on this pet subject of mine, but right into the story I became derailed with young Caesar growing up on an estate, outside of Rome. Then it gets worse (Marius an uncle on his mother's side, in the walls of Rome and asking for a Triumph) Ungh! But I read on hoping that at least the story would be good, but I'm dissapointed in that too. Total let down, this book is supposedly the first in a series, usually something I read to the very last book, but not this time. Just too bad, really.
1742	ordered 2 1 worked one did not: i ordered on for my self and one for my sisters mine works fine :) my sisters thought Looks slightly different and does not even seem to do any thing more then sit there uselessly except the random 2 seconds of charge
1743	Too glossy, no meat: I was expecting a little more substance from the book, perhaps some deeper examples and some better analysis and dirt and gossip from the wackoes that ran these dot coms, but the book was no more than a listing with a blurb at best on a whole stack of companies that went under. The blurbs were funny to read at first, but get old and dull pretty fast, and the whole thing ends up being a fun read for no more than 10 pages. It's a shame, I would think there's a lot of good dirt to dredge up and write about, and I was hoping this would touch on that, but it doesn't. I would skip this one.
1744	This is a terrible book: This was one of the worst books I've ever read. I had to read it for school, and don't get me wrong, I like reading, but this book was terrible. The plot is sketchy, the charecters are weak and the setting is over used. Any teacher who sees this, please do not make your class read this because I garentee it is a waste of time.
1745	Oustanding: This is a mixture of one of today's biggest stars. The Best Of Brandy is a must have album, giving hits from a debute album "Brandy" to "Never Say Never" all the way to "Afrodisiac". This is all of brandy and is a well worth purchasing.
1746	A Little Paranoid, But A Great Expose: I don't agree with everything Ehrenreich says in this book--Maids are made to scrub floors on their hands and knees so they will be "anally accessible"? Oh please!--but nevertheless it is a true-to-life portrait of real life at the bottom of America's economic ladder. I especially enjoyed Ehrenreich's very strong anti-drug testing stance, though I disagree with her opinion that "living wage" laws are a solution to the problems she uncovers in this book. Even if you, like me, don't agree with all of Ehrenreich's politics, this book will open your eyes and encourage dialogue.
1747	Humidifier: Does what it's supposed to.It's the humidifier for a humidor. And is the replacement part for the particularhumidor I own.
1748	Good tape: I've never had an issue with the way normal tape looks when wrapping presents, but this tape does really disappear and it looks good. You can still see the tape of course but it's much less visible than normal tape.If you wrap a lot of presents or are a Martha Stewart-type perfectionist, you might want to consider this tape. The other 99% of us can just use normal tape! :)
1749	Are we talking about the same book here ???: I my opinion Paranoia was a winner and the reason I gave Company Man a shot without thinking twice about it. In hindsight that might have been a bit naive but I never figured anyone who could put together a well written and entertaining thriller as that could put out a piece of junk as Company Man. The main character is one of the whimpiest "heroes" I have ever had the misfortune to come across. I mean, the guy has no spine at all and all he ever do is irritate the reader with his stupid, irrational decisions and cowardly actions. The plot is just plain stupid and only reason to finish the book is trying to postpone the realisation that you have been screwed. I can't believe all the positive reviews. This is pure garbage and there only right place for that is in the bin.
1750	DONT BUY THIS. Product discontinued: Linksys makes great stuff, except this product has a critical design flaw. I buy Linksys products for my office, so this product seemed like a home-run.BUt, I spent 40 days, and 3 shippments, trying to get the router to not lock up. The bug is with its wireless port. It freezes up.Take my advice. Don't buy this. Go buy a SMC or DLINK instead.
1751	Good if you're new: Pretty pictures and inspiring colorways, to be true. It's a small book and the patterns are all scarves and bags (I think, without looking back). No garments. Aimed at a very beginning knitting and very encouraging to someone who is just starting out.One of the project pictures gave me the idea to try knitting dead pantyhose. Still need to test that.Net: One good idea harvested. Glad it was in the library.
1752	This is the most compassionate, helpful book on the subject.: Sincerity and knowledge flow from each page, and I more completely understand what my wife has to deal with every day. Separate chapters on how the depressed person interacts within the family, at the workplace, in the community were especially interesting. We have used several techniques suggested in the book and found them helpful in keeping me from being pulled in to my wife's depression. She was so impressed with the change in my attitude that she read the book also and now we both recommend it to everyone we know.
1753	Glad Lucas Davenport & Co are back: It's wonderful to find Detectice Lucas Davenport back after Sandford's somewhat disappointing departure from the "prey" series. This latest venture gets off to a slow start as Sandford takes on the task of introducing a whole slew of corporate nasties who may also be murderers. This completed, the novel takes off like a rocket. Few can write action/suspense as cleanly and economically as Sandford. A great read that will satisfy long-time fans and new readers equally. Ignore the cheap homage to Carl Hiassen in the middle!
1754	The Ballads are back: Monster Ballads vol.2 is just as good as Monster Ballads vol.1. The ballads on vol.2 are just as good as the first CD, and I think that you must buy this CD if you already own the first volume. The ballads are back and bigger than before. 80's rock forever.
1755	Get ready to sleep: At first, I thought this was a parody of a boring way-too-wholesome children's book, but I was wrong. The sickening and soporific scenes keep stacking up into one giant sentimental sleeping pill. This is the same snooze-inducing drivel that has-been writing professors praise and perpetuate in the cookie-cutter MFA programs across the country.
1756	It was a book you never want to put down.: It was a totally cool book. It related to all ages from kids to adults. It was exciting threw the hole book not just in the begining or end. It was a book that could satisfy everyone's needs from Mystery to romance to horror. It was a fiction but could be beleavable. It teaches valuable lessons for life and teaches Teens not to do anything stupid. It is a graphical book but it is not overdone. That is hard to find in books now-a-days. I love all of Lois Duncan's books but this is the best. My other favorite book is also by Duncan. It is called Killing Mr.Griffin. It to is perfect in every way
1757	Terribly written: I have taken several math and computer programming courses. This it the worst book I have ever been forced used. I had a hard time recalling some of the math that is used immediately, the explanations are terrible to say the least. I tried for hours to figure it out using just that book. When I got home I found a different reference and had it figure out in one minutes. So basically the problems I am assigned I have to learn from another source to do... that shouldn't be. Find another author that cares if he makes sense or not, one that doesn't assume you will understand it regardless of how it is explained.... "such is higher education these days" I wish I could slap that guy.
1758	Animal Crossing: If you like playing video games for only 15 minutes this isn`t the right game. Once you start playing you can`t stop! Also, if your not into games like real life it isn`t your game. The story is like this: you don`t have enough money to buy a house so you have to work. Then you have to pay off your det on your own but as soon as you pay off your det for your 2 stoey home you get a monument in front of the train station. You earn money by catching fish and bugs, collecting shlls and fruit, and finally doing chores for the villagers. You are trying to do all this while still furnishing your home. But even the meanest animals will sometimes help you out by giving free things to you without you having to do anything in return. This is a great game though after your done working for Tom Nook (the shop owner).
1759	Even Better!!!: If you thought "The Clique" was awesome, then you'll love this book! Massie decides to through OCD's first boy/girl halloween party, but her parents are making her throw it with Claire Lyons! OCD also has a competition to see who can create the best uniform for the school. Massie and Claire come up with a solution in the end. The ending of the book was not the best, but was still an OK finish.
1760	There's Only One: Good show! Donegan at his best. Humorous and evocative of the birth of rock and roll as we experienced it growing up in the 50s and 60s.
1761	Worst Book Ever.: Meerkat Manor meets Saw.Seriously.Is this supposed to be a serious piece of horror? Because it made me laugh.But whatever.This is not New Weird, it's just bad.
1762	No MATLAB syntax: If you're looking for a book to learn how to model differential equations with MATLAB, don't buy this book. No examples in MATLAB are given, only references to what commands in 'DELAB' (The author's MATLAB interface) can be used to solve problems. I purchased and returned this book.
1763	Great Performance over my stock Toyota Wipers: Pros-Once they are installed they are all but perfect: These keep the window crystal clear and actually deposit a film on the windscreen which helps to repel water. I used to treat my car with rain-x, but you don't need to with these wipers. I have only had them a couple of months so I'm not sure how long the coating lasts but it work great right now.Cons-I little tricky to snap into place compared with my old ones, but once I got the hang of it from the first one, the others were easy.They have a bit of a shiny titanium finish which makes them stand out a bit more than the old black ones, but they are in no way "Blingy".
1764	flawless: this album is flawless!! absolutely beautiful!! if you like bossa nova but are looking for something modern this is it!! i especially love the song mais. even if you don't understand portuguese it will not stop you from appreciating this album.
1765	Good Box: Great product, but a little difficult to roll over for cleaning. It isn't that the litter box is hard to move, it's just that you need a large area to 'roll' it in. Also, you have to buy the right kind of litter. At first I was told not to get the clumping litter, but I found out that the box smelled pretty bad right away. The clumping kind seems to work best.
1766	Boring: I do not mind sexual jokes and smoking marijuana. However, when these jokes are not funny and very silly, I can not keep watching. We gave up after about 30 minutes. Not funny, not cute.
1767	alright set!: while I can hear the Stevie Wonder&Michael Jackson Influence on Donell's Voice&Sound He still can't come up with a full Sound.I dig the Lead off track"You Know that I Love you" but His Albums are too Predictable for there own Good.a big Problem is that Him&Usher are on the same Label&they kinda cross each other out in style.Jones to me is better suited with Up-Tempo Material to me.this set falls into the Cliche Label of most of today's R&B.
1768	Awesome: This is a really great devotion book. It's clear without making the reader feel immature. There is a great little journal in the book that makes it nice to write down thoughts and prayers.
1769	Had to return for refund: Worked for ten days although the readings seemed consistantly low, then would not pump up with any pressure and showed E error message. Changed batteries and still not working. Seems defective - Returned for refund.
1770	Not that good: I love Jillian's videos but this one is really short you have to do it after you did something else before, I believed it was going to be like the others so, no I will not recomend this one at all.
1771	Wonderful!: Couldn't have asked for a better sequel and what an amazing storyline. Can't wait for the next in the series.
1772	Price hikes sour the deal: +Great product-Sorry business model (hence the rating)While the product is top quality I think it is pretty crumby for the seller to almost double their prices practically overnight. For 2 dollars less I can buy the same product from the local hardware store, as a longtime customer of smallparts (tons of orders with them) I am Very Disappointed.
1773	Shallow Hal: I need to know which song plays in the scene where Hal is in the taxi cab with a girl who came to help her grandma. Please help!!!
1774	Wonderful: My granddaughter asked for several old movies for Christmas, she is 13 and loves this one in particular, just good clean fun!
1775	A must have book for anyone interested in anything!: A thoroughly enjoyable - and informative - read which touches on myriad subjects. It's the perfect book for a vacation since you can dip into it for a few minutes or for a dreary flight. I loved the writing style and the choice of subjects kept me turning pages. Sure, I knew some of this stuff - but it was worthwhile seeing it again just to have the chance to read the rest of the book. My copy went on the coffee table rather than the bookshelf so everyone can enjoy it.
1776	Ok on Hardware, absolute garbage on the OS portion: After reading the Hardware portion of this book and completing the practice exams for the Hardware test, I passed, although not by a wide margin. After reading the OS portion of this book twice, completing the practice exams, and EVEN MAKING NOTECARDS OF THE ENTIRE OPERATING SYSTEMS SECTION, I failed the OS test. One hundred bucks down the tube, thanks Syngress, I wish I would have read this review page before buying the book. I do not understand why this book has such poor coverage, it has the CompTIA approval logo on it. Ah lessons learned.
1777	I SHOULD'VE LISTENED: This product is the absolute worst.........well let me be fair....I'm still unable to install the OS.....It's been 4 days now I've been trying to install the software and it continues to hang/not respond during certain stages of setup.......now I'm to the point I can't even begin the setup...
1778	Not a troll: I am not a troll nor do I play one on the Internet. I do, however, think that there are many, many better ways for a true beer-lover to spend his or her money than on this ill-conceived, poorly-researched, sadly-executed, literary equivalent to an enema.
1779	Warming the Stone Children: "Warming the Stone Children" is an honest read; shared right from the soul. This is a powerful story of abuse and despair. What Christine had to endure growing up is totally heart breaking. This story will shock you of the betrayal Christine had to face, and then to survive such treacherous acts of abuse. Christine did survive and was brave enough to write her story of overcoming such a life shattered. Warming the Stone Children is a good read and will open your eyes, to the battle of abuse. Kudos's Christine~JL Vallee authorSevered Soul
1780	THIS IS A CHRISTMAS ALBUM??????: I only heard one song that I liked and that was "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" which is along the traditional feel that Reba's first Christmas album had. She totally butchered "Up on THe Housetop" by making it into a rock song. She never should have attempted "Mary Did You Know" because it is beyond her. The rest of the songs are forgetable and easily dismissed just like this album. I won't be playing this come Christmas.
1781	Moosewood: I LOVE this cookbook. You have to try the zuccanoes, stuffed eggpland, and the cauliflower marranca. If you are a vegetarian, or just love veggies you will find something in here that you like. I bought the book used in "good" condition and it came to me in decent shape, although not long after the whole binding did split in two. But, I guess that's what you can expect from a used book. I taped it back together and everything was OK. So all in all I was satisfied.
1782	Great Movie: did not realize it was coming from Italy and it would not work with my dvd player. Had to return.
1783	Probably my favorite: I listen to this all of the time - it never leaves the CD changer. The bitterness of "Pretty Noose" and "Ty Cobb" are so apropos for my life lately. And maybe the cynicism is why this Cd made it so big! Get it if you don't have it - real, gritty Soundgarden at their best.
1784	WHAT CAN YOU SAY BUT JUST.....HOO HA!!!!!!!: This beautifully written, acted, directed and told film is a gem. I cant tell you how great Al Pacino is you'll just have to see him yourself in this wonderful film that has more to it then just an angry blind col. This film has more demensions to it then a cube. You see Frank Slade has a solution to his problem and so does Charles Simms. They are both bad solutions and what can they do but help each other out with each of their problems. Its really a brilliant film and Al Pacino has never been better. Excellent film.
1785	My second feeder and wouldn't have any other kind: This feeder, my second one, lets me watch the birds frolic not the squirrels devour all the food. The activity around my feeders have increased letting me know come spring, there will be many more birds that will come and feed. Additionally, I saved over $50 by buying it through Amazon.
1786	One of my favorite books.: After my second reading of "Species of Spaces" a couple of years ago, I decided I should read it once a year. As another reviewer says, Perec makes the everyday so interesting, and it makes us question the ways we interact with our immediate everyday world.
1787	The lesser of two evils: I decided to replace my worn, cloth oven mits with these because they were getting worn and so thin that they no longer protected my hands from heat, especially wet heat and spills.Now, I've only used these silicone mits twice, but so far I am underwhelmed. I find them extremely unwieldy and inflexible. I didn't realize they were quite as thick as they are.Having said that, I think I will probably get more used to them. They have performed as expected in the realm of insulation and that was my big complaint with cloth mits. I guess I traded for the lesser of two evils here.
1788	Really nice with a slight flaw: Overall really cool. sturdy and built well. not sharp, but why would you need it sharp anyway? one problem, though. the longest sword was kind of loose.
1789	Butterfly NapkinHolder: Overally satisfied with the product. It has a delicate design and elogant outlook.
1790	Love Waterfalls: I love this book. We are going to Yellowstone this fall and I know we can't see all the waterfalls, but we will be able to see some of the ones off the beaten path because of this book. And for the ones we can't get too, we now can at least see a picture and read about them.
1791	Maybe an apt soundtrack, but dull as dust as music: Amazon listed this a few months back as an essential recording for any complete collection. Based on that and some 5 star reviews I bought it. In terms of disappointment, this one ranks up there with Chris Whitley's Din of Ecstacy. I can imagine how this sound track might set just the right mood for a depressing movie set in a god-forsaken, wind-blown town on the Texax prarie. After a second listening, it's one place I know I never want to go again.
1792	OMG its 2003 get with it: From the get go, this game really stinks. First of all we had to take this game back TWO times to get a working version. Finally we got one that worked. After the install it was very boring and very cliche.Problems:--Its the same Scenery or 'tiles' for the whole entire level your on, like they just copied and pasted all the hallways, objects etc.--AI is horrible--You CANNOT lean! sorry you must play like your a box, most FPS especially MPs have this function, why run around a dangerous corner when you can peek, why walk out in the open when you can lean out from some cover? Bad badYou can best sum this game up by digging up some very low budget and ancient FPS and give a little- and I mean little better graphics and there you have this game. Dont waste your money on this one guys.I enjoy Battlefield 1942, SOF1, SOF2, HalfLife - Chaser does not even come close to enjoyment. Save your money or wait a few weeks for this one to go into the bargain bin.
1793	Many Rivers Cross: Excellent DVD !!!! Sous-titres en franais, comme promis !!!! Je suis enchantée de mon achat!!!! MERCI à l'excellent vendeur dont l'envoi fut rapide!!!Christiane
1794	Nothing but problems: Like the other reviewer, I purchased this product from Auto Zone. The custom-shaped lock center broke away from the key outer casing while I was putting on the first lock. I could neither remove the lock, nor tighten it up all the way to drive safely. The product comes with a card that has a code to acquire replacement keys, but the code was stamped on and only half was readable. I emailed the company and they wanted me to make a mold of the shape out of play-dough, send it to them at my own expense and pay $7.50 to get the right replacement lock. I took the car to a local shop to see if they could get it off. They were able to rig up a fix by grinding down a bolt head to the right shape and size and putting it through the key to hold the shaped piece in place long enough to get the lock off. Save yourself a headache and go with another brand.
1795	Gamebridge: Gamebridge AVC-1400 USB 2.0 Cnct Xbox PS2 To Pc Xp SP2 2K SP4. Fast delivery. Good price.
1796	A Fun Read!: This is a fun, entertaining book. Take it to the beach and start turning the pages! You can almost see the movie as you read this thriller.Dan Brown has successfully arbitraged a lot of research about the Holy Grail and Mary Magdelene and the Knights Templar with the general public's lack of awareness of all that research into a cosmic whodunit.Along the way, you learn about Fibonacci Numbers, The Codex Leiscester, church and art history and mythology.If you want to know more about all the issues the plot deals with, buy "The Templar Revelation", by Picknett and Prince, at the same time(published in 1998, the first chapter is entitled "The Secret Code of Leaonardo DaVinci"!). Their non-fiction book describes in depth practically everything The DaVinci Code treats in this fictional representation.
1797	Very Disappointed: I have been meditating daily for about 5 weeks by now. At first, I used to think meditation was "such boring homework", so I bought some guided meditation CD's. Now I prefer just sitting with no CD, but I still think it might help you to start meditating if you have no previous teaching or experience. Nevertheless, I would not recommend this specific one. I wish it had less distractions. I wish the music were not digital, and I wish the narrator talked a lot less. If you are looking for some guides, buy something else or check out You Tube. If you type "guided meditation" at You Tube, you will find lots and lots of stuff to start with. And then see if a guided meditation works for you at all.
1798	Awesome: You get to know the wonders of the Calving Glaciers like you were looking into a window as you read its amazing detail describing these amazing figures in the great lands of Alaska I recommend this book to anyone its fantastic I own this book myself and read it everyday. A+++
1799	Clive Cussler does it again:: Blue Gold held its promise to be one of Clive Cusslers finest. I was so riveted by the plots and subplots I couldn't put it down. The characters are so realistic that at times I thought I was watching a movie, I could visualize everything going on, and holding my breath every other minute. The only thing I am sorry about is that I can't read in the shower, and I finished it. I really wish Mr. Cussler could write just a little faster. Thank you Mr. Cussler for all your books, I have read and loved them all....
1800	this product is terrible: When I first ordered this product it did not work at all. The screen was completely blank. I sent for a new one, which appeared to work initially. However after I started exercising with it I realized that it was indicating my heart rate was extremely high. During one run it said my heart rate was over 200. Since I am still alive, clearly the monitor was not functioning properly.
1801	RESTRAINT SYSTEM HAS A HUGE FLAW!!!!!: i'm so bummed that this carseat is not the quality i expected and hoped it would be. we bought this for our 14 month old son because of the rave reviews and tons of personal recommendations. while very comfy and fits tightly in the vehicle, the restraint system has a huge problem. the lap belt goes on my sons upper thighs, not his hips! if we were to get in an accident this could cause dislocation of his legs. like my husband says "it's just basic physics". i can't believe this seat is considered the *best* and i've only read one other review that mentioned this problem. nonetheless, i'm am taking it back tomorrow. we will test the marathon to see if it is a different restraint system, but if not, we will have to find something else. again though, it baffles me that no one else has mentioned this problem!!!!!
1802	Doesn't fold out - flimsy clips: I thought this was metal. It's plastic. The clips at the bottom are flimsy. The way they took this photo it looks as if the book holder will open up but it doesn't. They just formed the plastic so it would look as if it would fold out in the photo. What a rip off.
1803	excellant cd: we are very pleased with our purchase all our favorite songs by the dellswe on that cd how often does that happen.
1804	Highly Recommended DVD!: Serpentine is a really thorough technique and choreo DVD! Exactly what I was looking for, especially if you've danced a bit already! There's so much info in here you really get your money's worth and who doesn't <3 Rachel Brice?!
1805	Good Airport Book: Just what you want for a transatlantic flight, no more, no less. You are engaged while you read and when it is over you put it down and move on. Finished the book a few weeks ago and remember only the basic story outline. A very well-executed formula book.
1806	Pathetic!: As much as I love Zach Braff and Amanda Peet, I really thought this movie was a bust. I would have given it 1 star except for the two of them. This is a very dark "comedy," and most of the movie is rather depressing as Braff goes from one predicament to another. You feel sorry for him rather than wanting to laugh. Jason Bateman's character is really too diabolical for a comedy, and the constant pratfalls are just not funny. The movie seems to miss its beat somehow. The concept is sort of cute, a guy whose boss just happens to be his wife's ex, but the movie is more like a foray into an evil and disturbed alternate universe than the side-splitting hilarity I was expecting. I would not recommend this movie.
1807	Were Number 1!!!: i compleatley agree with pat buchanan and his well argrued book. keep out all foreiners!! serbias will should come to US AND clear out and do what they did to muslims as well to nonwhites. This country should be kept pure Anglosaxon or else: decline. Truth to tell.
1808	The Best Series EVER !!!!: This series is so damn good !!!!DONT MISS THIS ONE , if you do you really missed out .
1809	a story that should make you think: This is an excellent memoir about a Crips gang member. Easy to read and well worth the time.
1810	what a lemon!: Hooked up new a1700n with new HP 19" flat screen. Tried to burn Recovery Disks but failed. HP said to try other compatible brands. They didn't work either. Ruined 5 DVDs. CD/DVD burner making weird noises. Thought I had better put in my backup DVD disk in case and it chewed it up spitting out a broken part. All data lost. Waiting on HP to send new burner so I can make a backup. Installed correct extra 1GB RAM and memory bank #4 is dead. Need to get burner delivered so I can make new backup of data so I can return this system. System is slow and underpowered for Vista. NVidia card has terrible Vista drivers and fails miserably.I can't wait to return this!
1811	seams on tummy are lumpy, and tightness causes bulges: I was really excited to try these when I received them yesterday, only to be very disappointed. I knew they'd be kind of difficult to get on, but was hoping the 10 min of sweating on the couch would be worth it... It wasn't. Now, I can get over the fact that these look pretty ridiculous, but the seams on the tummy area are so lumpy and looked funny through my shirt. Then the tightness that ends at the top of the thigh creates a big bulge at the lower hip area like the picture. I couldn't get over how bulgy and lumpy everything was so I peeled them off and immediately packed them up to send them back. I found some knee high stockings of the same compression for $10 and think these will be much better.
1812	Waste time, waste money, waste wax and waste of energy.: The wax is very expensive and every time you turn on the printer a large amount is wasted and actually dumped into a waste tray from which it can not be retrieved.The printer wastes a great deal of energy and when you try and put it into power saver mode it wastes more wax and then pops out of that mode whenever it wants. You keep on putting it into saver mode and when it pops out you only know because your office heats up like someone turned the heat way up. This is not good if you live in Utah in the Summer. Might work great in the arctic if you don't mind the electric bill.Try to get any help from Xerox and you are truly wasting your time.The time to print a page is about six minutes if you start from the power saver mode.This makes a great door stop just never ever plug it in.The print quality is OK but there are spray jet printers that do a much better job that you can actually turn off from time to time.
1813	you might want to consider another machine: i ordered this exact serger through ebay, the bulb was busted and it didnt sew very well no matter how much i tried to work with the tensions. the seller was great and sent me a new one right away, the exact model. the serging is ok right out of the box, but if you change the threads and have to adjust the tension, forget it. the serging is terrible. i think the tensions in these machines are not very good quality, honestly, i dont know what its problem is. it's become very frustrating working on it for hours, reading and rereading the instruction manuel, and threading and rethreading. well, i'm on my way to the sewing repair shop!
1814	Plastic clips broke: After only 3 or 4 trips on the boat, the plastic clips holding the door shut broke. In addition, a third piece of plastic broke at the bottom of the door. My husband was absolutely disgusted and so am I, especially after spending the money that I did. It has been a complete disappointment. Apparently this was not an isolated occurrence.
1815	good rice: Whole grain rice is healthy. Brown Basamati ismy favorite. Very nice smell when cooking &delicious.
1816	Water Hazard Rescue Excellence: An excellent tool that is easily accommodated by the standard golf bag. The 21 foot extension length of the rescue retriever has been ideal for the water hazards encountered on the courses I play. The basket easily retrieves the golf ball and the orange color makes the basket easy to track while recovering errant golf balls. The product is highly recommended.
1817	great book: this book gives you a good view into making wargames terrain. it covers most of the aspects very well and have some nice illustrations.a lot the techniques can also be used in modelmaking and modelscenery construction
1818	BE WARNED -- SAME OLD JOKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!: If you've purchased any prior Kevin Pollack material, be warned -- this is just a new package of the IDENTICAL jokes contained on "A Little Off the Top" and his first self-titled album. He just cleverly changed the titles of the tracks to sell even more CDs with no new material. I love this comic, his impressions are dead-on, his material is funny -- but don't keep selling me the same tired jokes. I'm not buying them anymore.
1819	not worth a cent.: Sounds cool in theory but DOES NOT WORK in practice. Maybe we got a lemon, but seems like our son has to be practically on top of the Pooh with the rattle in just the right spot to get it to move. It also "reacts" if your child yells or cries loudly, not a habit I want my son to get into!! It also goes off at random when we're not even in the room!Bottom line - you're better off with a plain old battery-free stuffed animal for [$$$]. The rattle is ugly, but entertaining enough.
1820	not very good.: all the songs were about religion! and they weren't even well performed. I'm not sure these guys practice enough, or have enough talent to be good. and they really need to start writing songs about more subjects. who the hell wants to listen to an hour of music about a mythical figure living up in the clouds? if they are going to write religious songs, couldn't they put one on here about buddha, or mohammed, or quexacoatl for that matter?
1821	$300 to "Lease" a Box?: I just got off the phone with DirecTV to cancel my service. Sole reason for cancellation was this lousy HD DRV. I've never been so disappointed in a product. I loathe cable, but I'd rather have cable and a TiVo that deal with this unreliable piece of junk. (My three year old was raised in a TiVoverse, and she just doesn't "get" how the DVR could say it's recording a show for her, and then we go to watch it and it's 90 minutes of black screen.) When cancelling, I was appalled to find out that the $300 I had paid for this box was a lease downpayment, and that I now need to return the box. $300? To borrow it? No one said a word to me about this when I upgraded to HD...
1822	An Excellent Kettle: This kettle is both well designed and VERY functional. It boils 7 cups of water in about 4 minutes. The design is great. It heats on a platform and you can lift the entire kettle off without any wires to pour your water. A very aesthetic alternative to anything else I've found on the market, and SO much better design-wise. Sturdy and easy to use.
1823	Monk: Season Three: This was my last purchase of a great series. I had enjoyed the other seasons a lot and now my wife and son (8 yrs. old) is hooked on it too. The DVD was in good condition.
1824	Zip 250mb internal ATAPI: Writes and reads faster than the older 100mb drive offered by this manufacturer. I recommend it for those dealing with colleagues/customers who can't/won't deal with CD R/RW drives for data sharing.
1825	Practical and useful: If you need something that you can easily flip through, that files neatly and easily, and then stores away in a minimal amount of space - this is it. Great little storage item.
1826	Worst Ever: Bill Murray has been on a downhill slide ever since Meatballs, he has finally hit bottom! Fortunately I just rented this stinker. Oh my, did it suck. If you liked this then you'll like "Glitter"...
1827	Why isn't this movie available on DVD?: This is a great movie that should be available on DVD. I don't know why it isn't. John Goodman is an underrated actor. It is also a film that does not over-romanticize Huey Long.
1828	Great Artist or Drafting Stool: I love the almost "candy-apple-red" color, and the shiny chrome is great. The chair was so easy to assemble that I kept wondering if I was missing something. I'm setting up a standing work area, so I only needed an adjustable stool for when I am drawing, or when I get tired of standing at the computer. It arrived in perfect condition and seems quite stable and solid. However - I am only 160 lbs with a bony butt. This wasn't designed, nor is it intended for, replacing a comfy office chair or holding up extreme weight for long periods of time. It is a very pretty, functional, and affordable stool. So it meets my needs 100%. My only complaint? The chair was so well packaged that it literally took me longer to unpack it than it did to assemble it. A minor issue, but still a bit of a pain. Bubble wrap secured with invisible tape is very hard to remove and I still ended up with pieces of plastic wedged in underneath where you can't see it.
1829	The best book for learning magick: Looking for a book on magick or occultism without the mythological baggage, moral dogma, or out dated ritual? Get this book, read it, and DO THE EXCERCISES. The info in this book is that same stuff that "gurus" and cults founded by sci-fi writers charge members thousands of dollars for.
1830	no comparison to anything: For a long time i was really into industrial and goth but knew nothing of the roots. It turned out that when I evicted a tenant from a building a stack of cd's were left behind, this among them. I ignored it for nearly four years and then one day noticed his name on another CD so i got curious and popped this in. this defines chris among the founders of the Goth/industrial circuit, along with jurgenson, koinetzko, with groops like einstruzed neubauten and 1000 homo djs. notice these are the most dissimilar of the genre meaning he i consider is responsible for a totalyly different branch but equally worthy as the others. the former review puts him in the same vien as other artists, my only question, how can you use other artists as a root of comparison with their father
1831	Kill Bill F@#$%ing Awesome!!!!!: There hasn't been a movie with so much action and suspense for as long as I have been a movie buff! I have to admit that I am a bit of a Tarantino buff, but if you are looking for a movie with a unique story and unbelieveable action, you can not pass this movie up. The first section of this movie was unbelievable, and Part 2 is sure to wow even the most violent seeking movie buff that there is!!!!!!
1832	Kitty Pad: Our cat is in seventh heaven, the new kitty pads fit perfect and are clean and soft, we had washed our old pads for several years and decided to get new ones this time, so probably every three years would be a good time. Ordered through Amazon and received pads in record time.
1833	XTC Produces Another Classic: What's a band to do after making a record that promptly enters "Rolling Stone" magazine's "100 Best Rock Records" ("Skylarking")? Why make another record that's just as good! Includes their most infectious pop single to date, the very hummable "The Mayor Of Simpleton"
1834	Cat Stop: This is junk. It does not in anyway detect any movement beyond 4 feet. A waist of money. Buy a gun instead. A true cat deterrent.Lame!
1835	Go Tell It Someway Else: Go tell it on the mountain was an extremely frustrating book. While the themes and some of the events were good (i.e. racism, abuse, religion), the way it was written made the book unenjoyable for me. I found that the way the book was written made it this way for for others as well. I dont think this is just a coincidence. If the book was written differently I probably would have found it enjoyable.
1836	Some of Marley's best work to date--a fine sci-fi novel: I actually liked "Maquisarde" better than "Glass Harmonica", Marley's award-winning novel. The premise, a resistance against an evil corporate-government entity is not unique, but this is a well-handled rendering of the subject. The novel is in some ways reminiscent of Marge Piercey's "He, She, and It" though without Piercey's richness in creating a future world.Ebriel, a French flutist, loses her family in a shocking event which is covered up. She goes on a heroic quest to bring the perpetrators to justice, and her personal experience of persecution and her resulting rebellion are really the core of the novel. As usual, Marley brings her own knowledge of music to provide detail and context to her work, a nice touch as always and gives a flavor to the writing that I enjoy. I just couldn't put it down.
1837	Interesting Perspective: I like this book. The "story-like" format of this book is entertaining but it gets a little old for a hard core techy like me. I definitly gained some interesting insights into the Toyota development system but would have liked more focus on the facts and the theories than on the story that was used to convey the message. The ideas are very enlightening, surely valuable, and worth the read. I can over look the style to get to the ideas. It was an easy read and the "story" moved along nicely. I recommend this book but would like to find one without the fluff of the "story" vehicle.
1838	Our bag broke and Delsey does NOT stand behind their product: We bought this bag for our daughter because it was available in pink and lightweight. After ONE trip through TSA and carrying it on board, one of the back black guards tore half way off. We first called eBags and were told they could do nothing. We then called Delsey and were extremely disappointed. They do not have a repair center in Houston (the 4th largest city in the nation)!!! We would have to incur shipping charges to send it to one of Delsey's approved repair centers. If we had used the bag for more than one flight - or checked it underneath the aircraft - I might think some expense should be on our end. However, I fully expect a brand new bag to last more than a flight; and if it does not, Delsey should stand behind it. The only thing the customer service rep had to tell me is that many of their customers are frustrated with the lack of repair centers. We will NOT be purchasing any other Delsey bags in the future.
1839	ready fight: I love the gunsniper in the show and i love this model.It carrys 12 missles[2, 6 missle pods], a sniper rifle tail, and a blaster rifle on its chest ioverall love it and gave it 15/15.READY FIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1840	Strong Sophmore: Born to Fly is less traditional than Sara's debut "Three Cords and Truth" but certainly still a country album. Her voice remains awesome. Here are good songs:Great Unknown - uptempo tune about getting away with lover and throwing selves on fateCrying Game - great tune, best on hereFool I'm a WomanLove Don't Be a Stranger - done by other singers, Sara's is best.Cupid
1841	Look twice: Waste King 3101 ISE Adapter KitThis not what it appears to be?Check it out before you buy, it is only two pieces of rubber that clamp in the 3 bolt clamp, that allows you to hood the disposal up
1842	Sent it back: IT is awkward to use. It is not made in France or USA... it is made in China. A stick of butter doesn't quite fit in it with the cover on. I sent it back.
1843	A deeply inspiring read.: As an avid amateur cook and onetime kitchen gofer, I find it delightful and inspiring to read about the CIA, and the experiences of the students there. This is a book I return to again and again, when ever the daily round of feeding my family becomes dull or mundane - it reminds that 1) it could be worse and 2) of that (long lost in me) chef attitude of 'get it done'.
1844	Shrinkage: These sheets look as pictured. Following directions to wash prior to using, the flat sheet shrunk to 72" wide; it is now twin size. Because of the deep pockets in the fitted sheet, it still fits a double bed. They are usable, but barely.Also, since the weight is given in metric, "heavyweight" is a misnomer.
1845	DUMBEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED!!!!!!!: This game is stupid! I mean there is no point to it. It STINKS! I'm glad it came with my xbox, cause I'd be really offended to waist my money. This shouldn't even be a game! If it was it should be for free! It isn't worth anything. What were these maniac's thinking when they made this dumb game! First of all it's boring. I was skating for a couple of minutes and I never played that game again. And the music is auful! If that music was on the radio I would leave it off for life. Even my older brother was complaining. Plus the grapics stink period! We just skate around and do grafiti. What ever you do DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
1846	Do not buy UMAX !: I bought a Umax 3400 scanner about 3 years ago. The copy utility worked great however the other programs were difficult and touchy. I have since upgraded to Windows XP and it is now not compatible. I bought the software to upgrade it (duh) and it did not work (nonrefundable). I tried to contact the company by phone and they want to charge $25 for tech support over the phone (not to mention it's not an 800# and I had to pay long distance). NO WAY! I tried to e-mail them without any response. DO NOT BUY UMAX. THEIR TECHNICAL SUPPORT STINKS!!!!!
1847	Fable, The Lost Chapters: Even though the Amazon picture currently doesn't show it, this is the "Platinum Hits" version of Fable, called Fable The Lost Chapters. It includes expanded content not included in the original game.
1848	Performance is good but ...: Exceptional performance as Weller is known for, but for some odd reason; it unscrews itself - which is can be dangerous for the sensitive component board or for anything for that matter. I found that rubbing the end with a bar of soap (the screw on end) before screwing the tip on (the one you are going to use) has eliminated this loosening of the screw tips.
1849	Indestructible and Reliable: I already owned 3 of these and I just bought 3 more. If you're still using the plastic clips that came with your mics/stands, throw those out! They will break/crack eventually, especially if you have a bag full of stuff.Go out and replace your microphone clips with these. You'll be happy you did!
1850	Book is a bound photocopy. Cover Art is missing: Book is bound photocopy of a New York Public Library edition. It is lacking cover art. So yes, it is hadbound, but it is not an authetic printing of the original.
1851	Great: I bought this CD primarily for the duet "Written in the Stars" with Elton & LeAnn, but in playing it over and over, I'm hard-pressed to state my favorite - it's one of my favorite CD's and is presently playing on my CD ROM.
1852	Visualy stuning, but what the hell is going on here?: I loved the first flim. It was origenal, fast-paced, and just plain cool. I saw "Relaoded" a few days after it's thactrical release. I was confused, really confused. I was compleatly lost throughout the entire movie.The fight sceans are better then they were in the first movie. The highway sceen is the best action sequence in the history of cinama.November came around, and I hoped "Revolutions" would clear things up. It did'nt. Someone please explain this weird ass trilagy to me.
1853	Exceptional Resource!: I am a seminary student in Minneapolis, Minnesota and was introduced to this book in a class I took that addressed the issue of Grief in Pastoral Care. For me, this book was transformative. While I have never experienced the grief of losing a loved one to suicide, I have experienced traumatic grief in my life. This book has the gift of speaking to many people who have been traumatized in their grief experience, whether suicide-related or not. I am also a Police Chaplain and have recently been called to minister to four different families who have been impacted by this type of tragic loss. This resource not only helped me in my immediate ministry with the families, but I have used it as resource material for other Police Department Chaplains as well. Thanks to the author, for speaking so honestly about this topic and for helping those of us "on the front lines" educate and by God's infinite grace, perhaps, save lives.
1854	Wait for Version 18?: Version 18 is on the horizon - it is listed in the "Workd with Windows Vista" listing Microsoft publishes, so it is coming soon. Maybe this will solve some of the nightmares everyone mentions.
1855	Horrible Movie: Jusy wanted to see a scary movie so rented this one on a recommendation. Not scary. Just disgusting. Don't bother with this one.
1856	Incredibly disappointing: Do your self a favor and don't waste your money on this poor excuse for a plasma screen. The pixilation is incredibly obvious and there are much better screens out there for a lot less money. Sony, Samsung or even Gateway would be a better choice. Compared to the set I have, a $200 CRT would be a better choice. This is a $4500 boat anchor.On top of everything else, JVC's customer service (which borders on being non-existent) is terribly rude and not helpful at all. They are unprofessional in the extreme.
1857	outstanding: This is a view of history showing how the relationships between the occupying forces worked.The actors involved were top rate and the script was outstanding.
1858	Wonderful book!!: First of all, I'd like to say I am a first time owner of a mini pig. I didn't realize how much work my little bundle of joy would be till after a few months of having her. She definitely took control of the house and thought she was boss! Crying at 3 in the morning, nibbling on my shoes, screaming all the time. It all has changed after I got this book! Now she cries whenever I get up (around 8) instead of 3 am, very minimal nibbling, and she even learned how to sit! Definitely a must have book for first timers like me! Once you know how pigs think and act, you will have a new perspective on pigs! They just want to be loved and you need to be in control of them! :)
1859	Loose Fit: So my biggest problem is that this collar does not stay tight around the dogs neck. Not that its too big it just does not stay to the size we adjust it for. At least 3 times a day I have to tighten the collar so it doesn't fall off. Need less to say after 3 days of this our dog no longer wears it.
1860	Must read!: This is an eye-opener! Give it to your daughters, mothers, aunts, sisters, friends! And don't forget yourself!
1861	A marvie book: A Time for Dancing is one of the best books I have ever read. Its sweet and meaningful, and really makes you think. It changes points of view from Julie and Sam and its really interesting to enter the life of a cancer victim and her best friend. The book is sad, but I really like it, and I think that if you read it you would really like it, to!
1862	Bad even for a B -film: I am often a fan and supporter of low budget B films and I love Zombies as my favorite monsters... but this is simple BAD
1863	Too easy when compared to the actual ATS-W: I bought this and the Kaplan versions to prepare for the ATS-W, because I already passed the LAST. My friend suggested the Barron's version to me, but maybe she had a different version because this did not help me at all. The questions were based on definitions, while the actual test was mostly common sense. The part which I found the most alarming, is that this book did not provide an example of an essay, and just told you to consult your professor/teacher, and ask him to rate your essay. Maybe the LAST preparation is worth the buy, but not the ATS-W, because I studied, and I doubt I passed the test.
1864	Renaud' s best work: It is true that Renaud has changed since his career reached its apogy during the early to mid 1980s, nevertheless the album 'Boucan d'enfer' offers an in dept exploration of the enigmatic soul and lifestyle of an artist for whom I have always had a great level of admiration. The songs in this album (mostly balads)revolve around his battle with alcoholism, his decision to withdraw from the world and hide-out in seedy Parisian cafés and the departure of his wife of over twenty years.It is a rather stark and sinistre album that fans who have come to know Renaud's life and ideologies throught his music will definitely enjoy. The only up-tempo song featured on this album is the radio-friendly 'Manhattan-Kabul' duet with french singer Axelle Red. The song reminds us of a not so distant period (Fall 2001-winter 2002) where the entire world (oh yes... even the French!) expressed their compassion and sympathy towards the United States of America.Definitely worth listening to .
1865	FORTIES FUNFEST.: A small town girl marries the trumpet player of a travelling swing band. A very popular film in its day, this movie is infinitely more enjoyable than the title - which sounds like a statistical classification - would suggest. The cast is fun if eclectic: George Montgomery, Carole Landis, Cesar Romero, Ann Rutherford, Lynn Bari, Jackie Gleason & the Nicholas Brothers! Numbers include the zany I'VE GOT A GAL IN KALAMAZOO. ORCHESTRA WIVES was the second and final film made by the famed band leader Glenn Miller who disbanded his civilian band in September of 1942 and entered the military. Miller's Army Air Force band was astonishingly modern for its day with a much more sophisticated sound with lush arrangements accompanied by strings and superlative solos from the best sidemen in the pop music business. Miller disappeared during his flight over the English Channel on December 15, 1944: the world mourned this most popular of all Big Band leaders of the fabled Swing Era.
1866	A cheap cut & paste job: I was amazed that this 'book" is only about 20 pages. The drawings are shabby and crude - like Madonna.
1867	Better than those with a battery!: I had the other model with a battery in all of our rooms. They were driving me crazy chirping at wee hours of the night. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to give these a try. They work! I tested them many times (I drove my daughter nuts!) Finally! we can sleep peacefully.
1868	Ruined a Great Song: I was highly disgusted when I heard "Kiss Kiss" and realized that Stella Soleil had taken a song from the Turkish pop star Tarkan (called Spoiled) and ruined it. The English version is taken out of context with the music and the song should only be performed in Turkish to begin with. Thumbs down for this album.
1869	The book every Entrepreneur who needs financing should have!: Whoa! What an awesome book! Not only does it cover angel investing, it also covers such things as how to valuate your business, exit strategies, etc.It also covers a lot on Venture Capital firms!This book is a MUST HAVE for the serious Entrepreneur who needs funding!
1870	Kelly is a great singer!: I love "Thankful". I can't choose a favorite because I like all the songs. Even my 11-year old daughter and 5-year old niece like her.
1871	the 2nd worst game ever: This game is dum. All you do is go around looking for Mario.There's no action, no fun, no nothing. I can't beleive people bought this boring, pointless, and funless waste of money.
1872	Admit it: Master P has jocked every one from Cash Money, "Hot Boys movie,etc." Outkast, "Hootie Hoo," and now Lil Jon "those Jeans." Can you blame him. For someone who owns a record label without any talent as well as having no talent himself, bitting is his only resort. Being from Louisiana, we have officially disowned him before the release of this album. Don't nobody wear P. Miller clothing. All it does is jock other clothing labels. Everyone knows No Limit filed bankrupcy before, and if they keep releasing stuff like this, they better put their attorneys on speed dial. Alternative suggestions (if you want to get the real deal and not the fake) includes Lil' Wayne "The Carter" Outkast "any album" Big Tymers "Big Money Heavyweight" Lil' Jon... "Kings of Crunk" Pastor Troy "Universal Soldier""By Any Means Necessary." I guess there is a limit to No Limit: they continue to cross it, album after album.
1873	Such a great water bottle!: I used to have the red original ones, but this is such a great improvement! First off, the colour, or lack of colour is better. I don't have to keep looking for the washer anymore, as the new one only has 2 parts - the bottle and the screw-in plug. It stays warm for a long time, and easy to hang dry with a hook at the opening. RECOMMENDED for those looking for a water bottle.
1874	A good water bottle: I like the bite valve technology. Easy to drink without spilling :). Bottle is well made.
1875	Mr. Harrison's final offering is a real treat!: I ordered George Harrison's final album, "Brainwashed," without having heard a single track, and I'm glad I did. Although his voice sounds a little thin at times from the throat cancer that would tragically take his life in November of 2001, the overall sound of the CD is terrific, and the song selections are classic Harrison. "Rising Sun" reminds me of the Beatles, or at least the way the Beatles would sound if all members were alive and performing today; a masterpiece of a song. George also does a cool remake of a 1930 song I hadn't heard before, "Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea" (co-composed by Harold "Over the Rainbow" Arlen). Great guitar work throughout the CD, wonderful tight harmonies by all, super contributions from George's son Dhani, and a CD I recommend without qualification.
1876	It's a 100 page novella...: ...buried in 500 pages of tiresome drivel.Fortunately it's easy to skim through or even skip 30 or 40 pages at a time without missing anything "important." I gather the author is a college teacher and he's larded the book with endless, mundane details about life in academia. Some authors, like John D. MacDonald or Raymond Chandler, brought their stories to life with accurate descriptions of places or times; Benford, unfortunately, decided to unload his accumulated store of meaningless trivia into this novel and he is not a good enough writer to make it at all interesting.
1877	Really bad movie!: My husband and I got this movie thinking it was sort of like Vampire Sucks, which wasn't half bad, but when we watched Breaking Wind, it was so bad and vulgar that I still can't believe I went to the whole thing. There is not even one scene that's worth watching, it really is bad. I love to laugh, I love movies that make fun of other movies, but this one wasn't it, it really is so bad I really don't recommend it to any one. It was a waste of money, but most of all a waste of time. It is just plain garbage, believe me, not worth wasting your money on it.
1878	Nice small flashlight: Nice, handy, small flashlight. All metal. Seem to work well and is a convenient size. Sometimes, I think writing these reviews is a pain.
1879	Great for Beginners: This book is great for the new tarantula owner. It has plenty of detail about keeping your new arachnid, but does not swamp you with confusing and useless material. The illustrations and color photos were very helpful when describing the anatomy of this creature. Overall, I am very satisfied with this book. It was a great resource to add to my collection of arachnid manuals. :)
1880	fun for all ages: This book covers all the mother goose short stories most people grew up listening to, learning how to read or even reading to their own kids as they grew up.
1881	Random Anecdotes: I read this after I read "War and Peace" and was interested in Tolstoy. I was very impressed with Gorky's insight. This book is clearly written, and fairly interesting. It is full of random anecdotes - but in a familiar, sweet way, so it doesn't seem disjointed. If you would like to know some more details about some Russian authors, this is a good book. A part that stands out is Gorky hitting his landlady with a shovel, and the very last chapter about the way Alexander Blok treated a prostitute. It is simply written and wonderful to read.
1882	Almost unusable: This book, as the other reviewers have said, is an awful beginning or reference text for XSLT.I have to whip up an XSL transform only a few times a year, so I never remember exactly how the syntax works. This book is never any help. The introductory sections are not informative, and the reference sections are not well-organized and have no helpful examples.He likes to spend a lot of time explaining in various places that "technically, this blah blah blah is a valid construct, but no one will ever use it." Who cares? The book is supposed to help others get their jobs done.Still, I have been able to finish my assignments using this book, so I can't give it 1 star. 2 stars is generous, though, for how angry this book consistently makes me.
1883	20' length is very handy: I'm liking this set of jumper cables. The 20' length makes it easy to jump the vehicle needing help, without trying to turn around on the shoulder of the freeway, or some other, potentially unsafe, maneuver. Shielded clamps help avoid mishaps. Heavy gauge wire gets the voltage moving. I didn't downgrade for this, but the zipper on the bag that came with the cables failed the first time I used these cables and put them back in the bag. I may purchase one of the "Bucket Boss" versions that I have seen, as storing these in a bag is a good idea for keeping things organized.
1884	Starts off intriguing, goes nowhere: I too am mystified as to how this book became such a runaway best seller. The book starts out well, introducing us to a cast of crazies and describing Savannah in such a rich way that we are immediately drawn in. Unfortunately, the subsequent murder story with Jim Williams seems tacked on, and amounts to little more than a rehash of the verdicts in his four trials. In the end, the book seems to be more of a long magazine article than a cohesive work of non fiction. A major disappointment.
1885	Dynamic sound - very easy to get absorbed in: "Power Tool Stigmata" is a REALLY great album with elements of both goth (soft acoustic guitar riffs) and industrial (synthesizers and "power chords"). It's impossible NOT to find something you like on this CD - there's even a cover of the Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby"! Although there is really no comparison for godhead, one might also like Rammstein, Genitorturers, or TOOL.
1886	The best book ever!: Well I read this book thinking it would be just like the movie "Prefontaine" But I was wrong this book is excellent much more detailed in every way compared to the movie. Hey if it can entertaine a kid imagine what it can do for you!
1887	A so-so book...: I took a class in organic spectroscopy this year (spring 1999) and this was the primary textbook. My professor skipped some of the chapters and handed out supplementary materials instead. I don't know what was the motive to choose it as a textbook, i guess because it covers all, although superficially. If you are looking for a book on the subject, I suggest finding a few older ones that concentrate on subjects instead of something that wants to be the Holy Grail of Spectroscopy.
1888	Fascinating and fast-paced: This is a fascinating novel. The editor gives a convincing argument as to why it is believed that this novel was written by a female slave in the mid-19th century. Unraveling the authorship is an intriguing mystery in and of itself. The story is part gothic--part sentimental writing style. It tells a riveting story of a young woman's journey toward freedom. Along the way she introduces the reader to a variety of slave-experiences.I particularly loved the way the main character relied on god for support in times of great need. Her reliance on prayer rings with genuiness. I am not a religious person, but I was very moved by the relationship betwen god and the girl as depicted in the story. Her prayers were powerful.This book is valuable both for its historical relevancy and for its story, which certainly is a page turner. I thoroughly enjoyed the gothic and sentimental tones.
1889	Must Read: You can read this book over and over. First for the story and then again and again for ideas.
1890	FFF: (...). Seems like it was shot with 35mm film, not like cams used in some of movies. No great sexy shots and mostly scenes of two women getting it on. The only nice part i saw was the opening with lauren hayes ( she's so cute and hot). Too bad she doesn't open the jacket a little more to reveal that one-piece sling it looks like she has on. If your looking for a little erotic and tease and sexiness dont buy this.
1891	snoozefest zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: tried to hard to b cute and witty and not sure if it was the script or brolin trying to hard to 'act' or moore as a psychologist (about as believable as her being the president of the USA) but gosh it was hard to stay awake. kept fast forwarding till the pain was finally over and the movie also. i'm adding mine with the other 45 atm of 'used' copies to be sold.
1892	A good read...: Even though this book was published a while ago, I found it to be helpful in understanding migraines. The dietary recommendations are neither quick not easy but have been helpful for me.
1893	Will never be the same...: I am 35, father of two who was a die hard DM fan in the 80's. What a wonderful ride that was! Then they changed after the "Violator". Started exploring some weird sounds a lot of noise but no catchy tunes. This album is one of them. Precious is a good song, reminds me "Enjoy the Silence" but not a song that I would wanna listen over and over again. Lilian is a catchy tune but again it will never be a hit.They say a band should adapt to new times and generations (i.e Rolling Stones). Call me boring or old fashioned but never wanted DM change or explore new sounds. I think if they stuck with their original new wave style they would have sold more records thanks to their loyal fans. I buy every new DM album anyway with some hope that they would take me back to those days again, even though I know it will never be the same...
1894	Doesn't Match Picture: I agree with the previous reviewers. The picture clearly shows two T's of equal width (4mm). What arrived was a CRL product with a 4mm upper T and a 5mm lower T. Returning such an inexpensive product wasn't worth my time, so I shaved off the extra width of the lower T with a razor blade and it fit fine.
1895	Who Believes This Garbage?!?!?: Finally read this book which is supposed to prove once and for all that Eddie Oxford wrote "those" plays.This book is 25% biog of Eddie, 75% absurd supposition. I won't go into the old Facts that Oxfordians have brainwashed themselves to imagine around. I will recommend this:Read some Forums on pro-Oxford websites.Then read similar sites about "The Holocaust Hoax" and "JFK Conspiracies". You will find the SAME types of people in both worlds. I love it when Baconians, Marlans & Oxfordians (all CONVINCED that their idol wrote you-know-who's poems & plays) go at each other with the kind of hatred most people reserve for Hitler & Satan.To see how FAR this can go, reference "Shakespeare's Fingerprints", a book which attributes ALL of Elizabethan literature to Edward De Vere.This is garbage, plain & simple. Don't get caught up in this rubbish.
1896	Only Good For Nostalgia: In my opinion, the only value I got out of this book was the nostalgia of "old D&D". If it was a non-gaming related product, I would have put it down after the first chapter or two and never picked it back up.As others have pointed out, the characters are more wooden than anything else, and the way they bond immediately is unbelievable and just short of gagging.If you want old D&D, read the module itself. It's bound to be more inspired than this book was. And this is from someone who was really looking forward to this book, and therefore gave it every chance before deciding against it.
1897	Defiantly NOT 11,000 CFM: This fan advertises 11,000 CFM.I work in a fluids lab, and did a quick back-of the envelope calculation and found at best about 2500 CFM (Measured a max of 7.5 m/s over the 1.5' diameter of the fan). Not bad, but you can find better deals out there on fans at this level. I just hate false advertising
1898	Read about it in the NY Times July 17, 2005: This book was featured in an article entitled "Into the Woods of Small-Claims Court" in the Sunday July 17, 2005 New York Times. The article had some great tips from the author.
1899	Lives up to the title: This book really lives up to its title. By using the techniques in this book, I became more successful in my WPPI competition entries.Worth five times the price!
1900	Hysterical: Absolutely hysterical CD that captures all the fun of seeing Camille live. She applies her incredible wit to a variety of topics, many of which we've had some personal experience - who hasn't wanted to "go postal" on their HMO? Her kids must think she's either the coolest or most embarassing mom on the planet - my vote goes for coolest. Buy this & get ready to laugh all the way through.
1901	A great saga poorly told: No question that this fellow has done a marvelous job of research, but the book's power is diminished by endless detours away from the scene of action and by the author's penchant for throwing in name after name and detail after detail until finally this reader just gave up--it was just one big jumbled battle with dozens of characters mentioned once and only once. I finally gave up in total confusion as to what, when, and where things were taking place.
1902	Ouch: Easily one of the more painful movies I've ever seen. I love bad movies, and this one is terrible. You know within the first 5 minutes that this film is going to be a painful ordeal. I suggest you grab a few friends to help you mock the film. The MST3K (If you don't know, you'd better call somebody) treatment is the only reason to give this one a go.
1903	Cool: Collection of the best of Steely Dan, what's not to like ??I recommend it to all Steely Dan fans
1904	Down Syndrome didn't stop him: An epic journey into the mind of a Lil' Down-syndromed Lad whose IQ is no larger than his T-cell count.The Best part of this DVD is trying to desypher his jokes due to the extreamly large beefy toung and massive amount of drull spewing from his thin lips. The DVD is shot at a well known tranny park-n-ride just outside Mantown, a place Lil Jimmy frequents and rumor has it is the birth place of "Monster Rain", Lil Jimmy's favorite past time. In this DVD there are a few great cameos, Robert Reed bareing the imfamous Robe and bowl of luke-warm broth, Fredarica Bimmel"Would JA", and last but not least Helen, bee hive and all. This DVD made me Laff, cry and punch my wife for being to mouthy. Sadly to say, Lil Jimmy past away during the taping of this comedy classic due to is long time Pat Battle with "THE AIDS". oh no, don't cry, it was Lil Jimmy's live long goal the aquire the AIDS from a truck stop glory hole, which he did. GOD BLESS THE AIDS.
1905	VERY PLEASANT CROSSOVER ALBUM!: The first English release by this huge European star is a pleasant listen! It is mellow and filled with gorgeous smooth vocals reminiscent of Lara Fabian.......great lyrics.....just an overall great pop album...not much left to say=) Enjoy!
1906	A lot to manage..: A little hard to bring it all together on one hand, however on the other hand it all made perfect sense. Good details, very common sense, wish I would have been "aware" enough to have found it, read it and implemented it long ago.Think and Grow Rich
1907	Great universal remote!!!!!: Sony RM-AX4000 is great...I love the touch screen LCD display. You can program any electronic device to this remote! Even your lights!! I get alot of compliments from friends and vistors when they see this remote, and ask where they can buy one.The only down side of this remote is you MUST have a PC to program it properly or else you will not get all your features from your old remote onto this one...It would also be convenient if your PC is close to your T.V. in order to test out the programmed functions or else you will have top keep running up and down the stairs several times just to test out the remote every time you want to test the new fuction. Programing the remote to execute multiple fuctions at the same time is a bit tricky so you must have patience.The Sony RM-AX4000 has definately met and beat my expectations, This is one hell of a remote for under 80 bucks!!!!
1908	a decent movie: I actually like this movie alot & loved the books. I grew up w/ Conan , Kull, & Solomon Kane. Wished it had came to theaters in the US but for some reason it never came out here
1909	Rip off: This book was extremly boring. The author is trying to make money off Rowling's popularity.Some people say it's a good reference to the books, but no one really knows that's what J.K. thought of.I suggest you don't get this book if you like Harry Potter. It's a waste to buy.
1910	I like it: Should have come with cord and especially instructions, but overall, I like it and it is a cool little camera, a go getter and does its job.
1911	Vedder Impersonator.... he should be sued: Wow, this guy actually had the nerve to come back and make a solo CD after his no good PJ rip off band broke up. On the other hand, we all gotta eat right? Maybe this is the only way this guy can make a living.
1912	Screen shield for 15" computer: I would like to inform, that this product was in a really bad shape, do not buy from any online store, if you want to receive something that you will be able to use, go to a store and buy it. it was a completly waste of money.
1913	TV may bug out: This LCD TV looks like a good deal price wise, but the model I bought (not from Amazon, but the same model) had a lot of defects, and after ~100 days, past the brief 90-day warranty it had broke. TV started to turn on and off randomly for no apparent reason while getting interrupted by the (basic) built-in DVD player. It could not hold a signal to the TV. It may cut off TV signal to black or the audio would mute, pop, or it could also reset randomly. And it blasted a high-frequency tone each time at maximum when it cut off the picture, and then continues the loop over and over (the volume blasting will make you jump in your seat). The TV's ATSC/Qam tuner must of broke, and after a week of tolerating its problems, of turning on and off and blasting, it was thrown out.
1914	Southside & The Jukes: I love every song on this album. One of my favorite albums of all time. The horn section is amazing, and the lyrics linger .
1915	Fantastic Resource!: Every church choir director should own this book! The book enables you to match anthems to the lectionary in a snap. No more searching the Bible to see what scripture a particular anthem is based on. Having well selected anthems will add impact to your church service.
1916	freckles-books: This was a great story. If you are looking for an easy read and a love story, this is it.
1917	Halo: First Strike: Nylund, Eric: An Advanced Alien specie that is hotsile to Earth? One cyborg to defend her? Brace yourself for an intense war. The Master Chief returns in this thrilling novel to again protect Earth and her populace.This is by far one of the best books have read. It has an immense story that fits almost seamlessly with the story of the game it is based off of. I loved the detail put into the alien forces, as well as the detail put into the human structures and character. This book is a must buy for all people interested in Sci-Fi.Can't i give this a 10 out of 5 stars?!
1918	Inspirational: "Marines don't cry, but sometimes their eyes sweat."While reading "Lucky Enough" by Ed Beesley I found my eyes sweating. His story about his life up to the present is truly an inspirational read.And the old saw that "Behind every great man is a great woman" rings true when you think of his beloved wife Connie. She hasalways been a steadfast believer in Ed. Together they made lifeworth living...not only for themselves, but for many, many others.Thank you Ed Beesley for sharing your memories by telling us all that you have been "Lucky Enough."
1919	It's Alright: I can't seem to get into Jughead's Revenge because I don't like the lead singers voice. It annoys me. But the lyrics and instrumentals are good, so I say if the vocals aren't what you're about, go for this CD. It's pretty damned decent.
1920	American Idol finalists, mInus 5 stars: I bought this CD with high expectations. Imagaine how disappointed I was when I popped it into the CD player. It sounded like AMERICAN IDOL FINALISTS WITH HORNS AUGMENTED IN AS A AFTER THOUGHT!!!!! They are not very progresive or imaginative anymore. I'll stick to the real Chicago of the sixties and seventies. This band as they are now have no right to call themselves CHICAGO!!! You would think that with Walt, Jimmy, and Lee still in the band they would release somthing with substance. Personally, I would be ashamed to be associated with what is being put out now by this not quite Chicago band. They are not what they were.
1921	One long whine: I was very disappointed with this book. I like Robert Silverberg and this book received many fine reviews. I just could not finish it. I got about halfway through and all I could think of was this: waaaa, waaaa, waaaa. Guess what - as a 50-year-old woman, there are things I can't do as well now as I could when I was younger. That's what happens. There are other things that I am better at now - experience counts.Since I am in that "middle-age" group, I really wanted this book to be interesting and insightful, from a slightly sci-fi standpoint, of course. Instead, I got one long boring whine about getting older. Yawn. If you're a positive-minded or matter-of-fact person, don't bother. You'll be aggravated with the main character after about 15 pages or so.
1922	Guilty Pleasure: Despite being inaccurate enough to challenge a romance novel (well... maybe not), I loved every moment of this book and am eagerly looking forward to the rest of the series. Maybe it's because Ms. Harper wrote Elizabeth exactly as I imagine her... vain, tempermental, proud, brave, controlled, and above all, very, very smart. Books that portray her as an idiot drive me nuts, and happily, this wasn't one of them. The only reason I read it was to get another glimpse at a woman and a period that I love so much, and did it ever deliver! So if you're looking for a mystery, I'm sure there are better ones. If you're looking for historical accuracy, this isn't the best book for you, either. But if you're a Tudor fanatic like me who's just looking for a good book and some fun, this little volume is perfect. Bravo, Ms. Harper!
1923	POS: My BIOS sees the card fine, but no matter what I did, Windows 7 will not properly install the drivers.I wanted to use this card just as a controller for a CDRW drive and not for RAID. The manufacturer's web site instructs to flash the BIOS on the card to use without RAID. However they fail to provide the instructions on how to do that. After a Google search I found the process and flashed the BIOS on the card.Still will not install the drivers in device manager, even though it now shows as a SATALink instead of RAID controller.Downloaded the latest drivers for Windows 7 from the manuf web site and get an error that the driver isn't for the device.At this point I surrendered and returned the card.
1924	New pampers Cruisers are terrible, they leak!!!: Was a pamper fan but we switched to different brands.New pampers Cruisers are terrible, they leak every other day!They removed some liner and protectors (trying to save cost??)As compared to the old Cruisers, the new Cruisers are with terribly bad design and always leak!
1925	Too late...: Trying to capitalize on the street racing scene and the success of the Fast and the furious franchise and need for speed series. This film is too little too late. I'll give it up to decent camera work but bad acting, bad line delivery, and the same ole' romeo juliet story ruined it. It felt like a self important student film trying to be edgy. Save yourself the cash folks.
1926	Think out of the Box: This is an excellent resource for making changes in one's life and work. I found the exercises in the book especially helpful in getting me to think out of the box. The book helped to clarify my own personal working style and what type of work situation would most ensure my success. I highly recommend this book for anyone thinking of making a work change.
1927	Reliable and reasonably quiet: I've used this coffee grinder for about a year with no problem. It grinds enough for 12 cups quickly without totally ruining one's hearing first thing in the morning. My only gripe is that the removable container isn't that well designed, and getting coffee from the grinder to my canister often seems to result in grounds all over my kitchen counter. Of course, being half asleep in the morning may account for that. . . .!
1928	Not sufficient for calling card users: Lack of speed dial is a problem for calling card users. You can enter your pin into the phone book, but you can't use the phone book once a call is initiated.
1929	Less Survival More Translation: This book although has some good tips has more tedious translations then tips. If I had wanted a book on what to say I would have purchased one.
1930	This isn't a true 4x2: This isn't a true 4x2 matrix switch. It does not work to select one input to go to both outputs at the same time. You can but the signal gets messed up.
1931	Nothing happens!: I really loved the first two books in Fforde's Thursday Next series. Therefore, I was extremely disappointed in "The Well of Lost Plots." I literally could not finish it. I always have a pile of books by my bed and the call of another author was just too great. I abandoned this book on about page 150. I was mired in cleverness and inside book jokes. Other reviewers have noted that this book takes place almost entirely inside the world of books. I think that may be the problem. There's no connection to the characters in the Outland or the previous storylines. Also, I began this book within a day of finishing "Lost in a Good Book"; maybe I just needed a break. Thursday Next is my hero and I wanted to read more about her. I just couldn't maintain my interest in the plot -- or lack thereof. I'm going to try the fourth book in the series, upon the recommendation of one of the reviewers, but I found this book to be considerably less satisfying than the first two. Be forewarned.
1932	Astral Projection from the Western Tradition: I've been reading these negative reviews and find that they are based primarily on a fundamental lack of knowledge and in a couple cases easy solutions to the complexity of this kind of work. One reviewer claims that this book is too "occultish". That's laughable, becuause not many things are more "occult" that trying to force your spirit from your body with the intentions on traveling to other dimensions of reality.Having said this, the book is challenging because it actually asks something of the reader......dedication and commitment to the process. These authors are practicing metaphysicians/magicians for many years and are the head of a magickal order based in England called Aurum Solis (Denning recently passed away).There is a lot of experience between these pages and it can work for you if you work with the techniques within.Namaste
1933	the lord of the rings trilogy on blu-ray: this movie alone is great and it finnally should come to blu ray, but i agree the extended cuts of the films should be relased asell. there is plenty of room and people are going to want to see them. Im not buying this version untill the extended cut version is definetlly out first. Still a great movie to watch on blu-ray.
1934	Oldie but goodie: Danny DeVito is one of our favorites and this is one of our favorite movies and we only had it on tape. Thanks to Amazon we have it on DVD.
1935	Great Holiday Movie!: This is a wonderful holiday movie for families. Curious George and The Man With the Yellow Hat learn what Christmas is really all about as they try and find each other the best Christmas gift. Several of the characters from the PBS TV series are in this movie and it's a colorful, thoughtful story that will be a happy treat for all Curious George fans! My kids love this one! Very highly recommended!
1936	don't be FOOLED!: don't be FOOLED by all the hype. if you are buying this product for the amount of money they want to poke you for, STOP!!!!!OLAY'S REGENERIST MICRODERMABRASION TREATMENT which is EXACTLY i mean EXACTLY, did i say EXACTLY like the one you are wasting your money on. it is HALF the price or less (24.99) for both the JAR OF ORANGE CRYSTALS (2.2 oz) and the BOTTLE OF ACTIVATING GEL (2 fl oz).buy it for yourself and COMPARE THE INGREDIENTS and plus it smells the same as philosophy's there is NO DIFFERENCE IN PRODUCTS, just the PRICE.....edward donovan cruz
1937	Don't waste your money!: I guess before I bought these, I should have looked to see the geographical location of the people who reviewed these chains. Let's see... one was in Las Vegas(the desert) and the other was in Southern California (also the desert). With tire chains not something they regularly use in that neck of the woods, these flimsy little tire chains might actually work. Even when properly sized, faced with a New England snowfall, these strings with springs broke on the very first rotation of the tire. Do not use these chains in any environment in which you might need to rely on them for traction or safety as they are sure to disappoint and you could conceivably put yourself at risk.These are going back to Amazon - a complete disappointment and waste of money for those who need strong, reliable tire chains.
1938	Heart wrenching!: I have a great deal of mixed feelings about this book. It had been recommended to me several times so I decided to buy it and read it. I was bowled over by the tremendous poverty of the Irish people and many times near tears. Surprised by the discrimination within their own country against each other based upon wealth, religion or birthplace. There are great moments of humor within this book that at times are hard to laugh at but one has to see them through the eyes of the child. This is a book you love to hate or hate to love. Hard to put it down but hard to pick it up as well. If nothing else, read it for the insight into the Irish people and their history.
1939	Poorly designed strap: The closing "snap" on the watch strap is so poorly designed as to be unworkable.You are not sure if it has closed securely or if the snap will open and you may losethe watch. The watch itself is fine.
1940	Deep Spiritual Movie: I can't say enough about the movie "I AM." It is a movie that you REALLY need to pay CLOSE attention to, because if you don't, you will miss so much. I especially love how this movie shows that in EVERY aspect of your life, God is there through His Holy Spirit, leading you, guiding you, directing you; but NEVER forcing Himself on you. Ultimately giving us a chance to make our own choices. I highly recommend this movie!!!!
1941	This book challenges you to a diffrent lifestyle: I completely enjoyed this book! I appriciated the real life stories and lessons that were offered throughout the book. In the world in which we live, it's refreshing to know that there is someone out there who feels the way you do about the whole dating thing! Thank you for being a light and showing that there is a better alternative out there. Thank you again!
1942	Great INFO...: Lots of information to take in and learn (could be overwhelming). But, changes can be made in your life to improve your health if your willing to slowly make changes in your 'routine' of what you eat.. habits etc. The book is a EYE opener.1) Don't trust FDA2) Don't trust Food industry3) Don't trust Government to take care of your 'health care needs'as they will care for their wallet 1st.CAREFUL who you trust w/ your health. In many ways your responsible, don't depend 100% on anyone but yourself..then seek assistance for health care providers. Be careful to trust MD's who may be getting kickbacks from Pharmacy reps/drug companies etc. I SUGGEST THE BOOK as a learning tool, 4 stars.
1943	Anthrax's Best!: I've got this album in addition to Among The Living and We've Come for You All.Maybe I'm showing my age,but I much prefer 80's metal to nu metal.That said,I like STD better than Among,which most people seem to think is Anthrax's masterpiece.Don't get me wrong,Among is one of the best.But as someone who loves both,if Among is a 10,then STD is a 10.5!I think the album is solid from beginning to end,where as Among slows down a little bit here and there.STD is 80's thrash/heavy metal at it's best!
1944	70th Birthday gift for a set of twins.: I pasted the faces of the birthday boy and girl over Arnold and Danny.It was a great fun surprise.
1945	Disappointed: I was looking forward to hearing the Zemlinsky symphonies. However, to my ears these compositions were simply a so-so listening experience. They are something I might listen to once every two or three years. The performances were well done but the music was boring. It could be just me but I was disappointed.
1946	Pretty good: This product is pretty good. When I got it, everything was here, and I was very eager to start making things. The book has instructions on how to crochet before learning to knit with the spool. There are tips on how to tie ends together, seal ends (you use nail polish to keep the ends from fraying), and a couple others. Then it shows how to knit with the spool, and has different patterns you can try with the many different colors of string and beads it provides. It doesn't have enough string to make many bracelets with the 4-spoke stitch, which was a disappointment to me. It was very hard to choose which string to use with the certain colors of beads. 8) All in all, it's a (as I've said before) pretty good kit. 8)
1947	I love The Newsroom: I first came across this show on PBS around ten years ago. I loved the show and was happy when it finally came out on DVD. There are not a lot of extras, but I'm okay with it. One of my favorite shows of all time.
1948	This was one of the crapiest movies ever: This sucked. The cast was bad. The story didn't make any sense at all. What the hell kind of a chance was there that in the 1700s there would be cars and a legion of super monks in tha freakin vatican. Also Kate Beckingsale was badly casted, her accent wouldn't fool a retard. (...) I mean for God's sake this guy was crying when a few people chased him with a torch. The twist was ridiculously stupid also. Van Helsing becomes a Werewolf. OOOOO wow amazing. This looked good in trailers and I thought that ever since they got the guy that directed the Mummy that it would be alrite, but I was dead wrong. Waste of money in my book.
1949	no other novel comes close: Shanna is what dreams are made of.Ruark is the man of MY dreams!It was the first novel I ever read. I can quote from this novel verbatim! I imagine Ruark in the 2lst century, with me teaching him all the wonders of our world as it is now. He was very modern and self-assured for his time. The book is great!
1950	LUdaCrIS whAT waS Ya tHInkIN' ?: this cd is so weak i would give a star but he has some nice collabos with snoop dogg and lil' flip there4 its 2 stars. the single Stand Up is the best song on the album and was produced by kayne west.the only other good songs worth listening to are Screwed Up w/Lil Flip and hoes in my room w/ snoop. you should go get the black album or beg 4 mercy be4 you cop this album!---i aint a luda hater but this is wacked---
1951	queens girl: Don't buy this they took to long to come and the first disc didn't work and they didn't replace it. Don't buy this
1952	WASTE OF MONEY: I ORDERED THIS FOR A SURPRISE 40TH PARTY AND WHEN OPENING IT FOUND A HOLE THE SIZE OF A NICKLE, EVEN WITH EXTENSIVE MENDING WOULD NOT HOLD AIR...WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY....IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY BIG SURPRISE DECORATION..WHAT A LET DOWN. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!
1953	Best move ever: Loved this movie every since I watched it as a child. It's a great piece and will always have a place in my childhood.
1954	Terrible translation: I am currently reading "The Death of Ivan Ilych" by another translator and it is a remarkable and moving story. However,the translation that is offered in this edition was so awkward that I found it unreadable. The purchase of this edition was a waste of money and it's now sitting on my bookshelf unread. I recommend the translation by Constance Garnett. I hope that Pevar and Volokhonsky (transaltors of War and Peace and Anna Karenina) will release translations of Tolstoy's shorter works. Their translations are my favorites.
1955	Metaphors: I checked out several books from the library after reading "The Calculus Gallery." Newton made comments about terms in an infinite series that intrigued me. C4D explains & illustrates examples such that broader application is quickly made possible. Ryan has really cool visuals on pg. 25 -- for the non-mathematician to "zoom in." If u like koans, read the 1st paragraph on pg 210 -- it applies equally well from engineering to Buddhist meditation. This book may target the "dummy" audience but it is written by a true teacher -- inspired. Oh, and BTW Ryan makes the actual math of calc accessible. After browsing several, this is the book i bought for pleasurable dabbling.
1956	Great print book; disappointing audiobook: Reading the fine print on the bottom of the box, I see this is technically a Books on Tape recording, so Simon & Schuster is off the hook. I can overlook Cotter Smith's somewhat flat reading of the text; after all, you can only add so much drama to a non-fiction book. But if you're going to read a book that focuses at least partly on Thomas Jefferson, is it too much to ask that they pronounce his own home correctly??!!!! Is it too much to have a director or producer say, "Hey Cotter, could you back up for a minute? It's 'mon-tuh-CHELL-oh,' not 'mon-tuh-SELL-oh.'Quite frankly, this is at least an average recording overall. But the fact that one of the most basic components of Jefferson's life, something we're all taught as children, can be mispronounced and then make its way on to a finished recording ruins this production from the very beginning.
1957	Deoxys!!!!!!: DEOXYS IS IN THE NEXT POKEMON MOVIE!!!!!!!!!! but deoxys will probably become a promotion like mew, celebi, and jirachi !!!!!!!!!!!! they'll probably delete it from the easier way of getting it in the game and make it so then you have to go to Pokemon Center NY in order to get it or somewhere else.... They shouldnt have made celebi a promotion and instead think of an alternate way or getting it since the goldenrod pokemon center in crystal version is VERY different from the english version.
1958	Don't Bother: I thought I would need one when I fry, but soon realized I really have no use for these. They just sit in my kitchen un-used.
1959	Pure Balls!: The previous reviews go into much greater detail, but I can't help but weigh-in on this one. This well-recorded live show from Winterland in '73 hits you over the head like a hundred pound sledgehammer. I agree that this performance is superior to "Rockin' The Filmore", despite the absence of Peter Frampton. I can do without Marriot's coked-up between-song "testamony" (man, that gets old REALLY quick!). But otherwise, this is a rockin' good time in the same leauge as "Live at Leeds", "Live at Budokahn" and "Get Your Ya-Ya's Out". These new "Heavy" bands should listen to this CD to hear what real rock and roll is supposed to sound like. They're in for an old-fashoned ass whoopin!
1960	picture quality!: Hello support,I'm quite disappointed with the very very.. poor picture quality of the dvd! (all of them) I do like Tony Sanches yoga ( I've used it before and the picture quality was great).However, the picture quality of all the DVDies that I purchased are extremely poor, I'd like to receive a better quality DVD or refund.Regards,Shaun
1961	DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$: this is a stupid book. it doesn' tell you anything that you, as sensitive person don't already know about yourself.
1962	nothing special: I know better than to watch a TV commercial and buy something a TV star is selling. But I did it. I was concerned about loosing hair. It didn't work.
1963	Hype, a healthy game for kids (and more): I first played Hype on the PC of a relative and now, even at 28, I bought the game! The one thing about this game I like the most, it is "healthy". There is an amazing storyline on one hand and on the other, there is a fair balance between problem solving (great puzzles by the way) and fights. The level of violence is fine, Hype never kills anyone, enemies faint when they die and never the player can uses unnecessary brutality. Nevertheless, combats are fun. Graphics and music are also way below average. Let's face it, it is not exactly Zelda as they mentioned one hundred time on the box but at the third of the price, it is well worth it.
1964	nice: I have an older version of this headphone, and use it everyday for hours. It sounds very good, and for the price is very hard to beat for this type of headphone. My only complaint is that my ears hurt if i wear them for more than a few hours.
1965	boring and stupid, don't waste your money!!!: I bought this book almost 3 months ago and still haven't finished reading it. Normally I consume these books, but this one just doesn't peak my interest. Both Max and Angel are boring and really don't have personality. The rules of this magical world are odd, and really don't make any sense. A watch keeps his safe in the sun? It's just silly and boring. Adding a wereworlf into the mix was downright stupid. There wasn't anything original about this story, don't waste your time or your money.
1966	Not recommended: To start: The item I received was mostly, but not entirely, like the picture. And it's the not entirely part that got me. The image shows a full leather connector between the cover and the case. Mine had a .75" or so pivot.And that's why I gave it away to someone else in the office. The cover felt flimsy, didn't fold back well, and just generally didn't work for me. I like the idea of it - the slots for cards, the open case for the keyboard, etc. But in practice I used it for about 5 minutes, and swapped out for a case that is no longer in stock.
1967	my review: 30mm vintage crystl pink feng shui ball: for one, it shows a string to hang it and yet does not come with the string. secondly, if it was a fake crystal such as acrylic or glass, and believe me, this one is fake--it did not specify so i expected a genuine authentic little crystal. i've now discovered i have to type in real hanging crystals in order to purchase an authentic hanging crystal. i wish it would have fully disclosed what this crystal was made of. very misleading. overall,it's cute if you want a walnut size fake plastic ball with no string.
1968	unclear: The instruction was hard to follow. Master Chen says step to the right while he is stepping to the left, very confusing. He does not show the movement of the hands, arms, and feet clearly.
1969	Full Catastrophe Living: Although Jon Kabat-Zinn can be a little verbose at times, he tells a great story. He's excellent at presenting difficult information in a coprehensible, functional and life altering way. This book is a great guide for the beginning meditator as much as for one suffering with debilitating pain, both physical and emotional. Kabat-Zinn takes you through a journey leaving you with the tools to cope with life's challenges in a more positive and productive way so that you can live a more fullfilled and joyful life.Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness
1970	Don't bother, it's not worth it: I wanted to like this book. I really did. It's a discussion of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" from a feminist viewpoint. However, after reading it, I can't really say very many positive things about it. It seemed to me as if every point Roberts made was illogical and simply manipulated the episodes to suit the point she was trying to make. Part of the problem is that it was based a lot on French feminism, which I find uneven at times, but there is good writing that stems from it, and this is not it. Roberts contradicted herself, and used to the same evidence in various parts of the book to come to different conclusions.I was hoping she might redeem herself in the conclusion, as I often found authors have more coherency in their conclusions, but no. The conclusion was just another ruined analysis, this time of "Voyager". When I finally put the book down, I was relieved.
1971	nothing stands out: I read some of the review and thought for the low used price Why not. Let me tell you why not. Nothing stands out. This is also a general critic of Contempory Christian music. Mediocracy is the theme of most music. I listened to this CD twice and thought everything sounded the same. GOD forgive me but for praise to our LORD my standards are much higher.
1972	BSB: Truly Never Gone: BSB is the best group ever. This longly anticipated album in my opinion is not only their best album but the best I own. BSB is back to stay! Best track? Never Gone (Co-written by Kevin)
1973	Simply the best, industry standard: Been using Wham-O discs for your Ultimate? Come on man! You gotta go with the Discraft Ultra-Star. This is simply the best disc on the market for Ultimate. True flight lines, and tough enough disc (unless of course you are using it on concrete). Great disc, buy it now, you will not be disappointed. Comes in great colors too.
1974	Who deleted my negative review?: This is my second posted review of this book. Somehow authors or interested parties are able to delete negative reviews, depriving the consumer of information.This book covers the basics, but sorely lacks in medical and nutritional knowledge. The author is a midwife, not a OB doctor.
1975	So disappointed: I was so disappointed by this album. I expected so much more. Geri's voice on her own leaves much to be desired. This is a set of the most uncreative pop songs I've heard in a long time. I'm so disappointed.
1976	God's and kings: This is a very needed message for the children of God today. Do not give in to temptation as it will multiply and lead you on a path away from God.
1977	Who sank the Boat: I can't rate the book, because I haven't received the book. Please send any information that will help me find my book.
1978	Problems: The sound stops randomly stops working. Will not always respond to start recording. Disappointed.
1979	Too academic: The book talks about body language in general terms. I wanted more practical insight that I could apply immediately in my interactions with people.
1980	dont do it: its a neat novelty, but as far as any kind of application, its crap. should have left this one alone
1981	Not compatible with windows 7 64bit?: I received this product this morning and spent all day trying to install it. I tried to install the drivers in the CD provided, looked for the drivers online and any ways possible but this thing doesnt work and my computer kept on saying "USB device not recognized"Anyone can help or the product just sucks?
1982	NORELCO RELACEMNT HEADS ARE EASY TO INSTALL: The Norelco HQ9 replacement heads were so easy to replace I had done the job, including cleaning my whiskers out of the razor in just under 10 minutes! I am not very good with my hands so it was a big surprise. And when I shaved, WOW....major improvement!
1983	great phone panasocin KX-TG1033S: very happy with the quality of this telephone, I no longer get cut off as I walk through my yard while talking on the phone.
1984	Subtitles: I read all the reviews and searched through many movies and decided this is the one I wanted to watch. No where did I see the word subtitles....but it sure is. If you dont mind them go for it...had I known I would have moved on. I hate ready everyword....
1985	Shame on you Amazon Guys!: WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?I spent about $155 with you Amazon Guys and ANOTHER $90 for duties, customs and re-sipping to my place in Mexico. I finally have it and I just knew this is a pre-owned one. Even the instruction manual comes with pencil marks for every where specially over the times 20-30 minute notes. It seems somebody was previosly upset with you and maybe cause the ice cream maker is not working as expected to.I see there is no sense to read all your feedbacks and reviews because all is real waste of time and all because of you Amazon guys!.It seems to be a real hoax to me!. Exchanges from people to people so the house never loose!.Shame on you Amazon Guys!I'll test it after a while to let oil down and will post my results. But actualy would bet it will not work properly.
1986	Terrible!: This is a stupid book. I don't like Melanie or her horse. Melanie is a stuck-up brat and her horse is a snotty, annoying filly.And her name shouldn't be Perfect Image, it should be Loser Image! I'm still a fan of Christina and Wonder's Star. I hope that more books will be about Chris and Star. Go Star!
1987	Can't put down: The book is totally unrealistic but it does not matter. It's a fun read that never bores. I have read one other book by Scottoline and find her to be an author that keeps the fun coming. I am not giving it a five star review because there was not enough of Rita in court, the only flaw with the book. Take it on an airplane with you and you will finish before the flight is over.
1988	A Beautiful Masterpiece: I absolutely love this album.It is one of the greatest albums you can buy.The song Stranger on the Shore is beautiful.Especialy when it is played on the clarinet.It's a very relaxing album.I would recommend this to anybody.
1989	It's amazing!: There's a lot of action in this movie. I like when Spike talks...it was really funny! I like that Debbie and Angelica meet each other, because they're alike...they're both mean and bossy. It was nice to see Angelica get bossed around for a change. I didn't think this movie was too scary. My brother and I really enjoyed this movie.
1990	haven't read it yet: haven't read it yet so can't say whether or not I like it or not. will get to it eventually
1991	Not Much Here: I borrowed this book from the library after reading the four and five star reviews on Amazon. It was very disappointing to find out that it was not scary as advertised. The characters never come alive and the situations in which they are involved are implausible. I kept expecting to be caught up in the story but it never happened.
1992	"Hannibal" a disappointment: And it started out so interesting! But by the end, Hannibal seemed way out of character, and Clarice wasn't the same Clarice from Silence of the Lambs. I was disappointed by the ending. Not nearly as good as Harris' other works.
1993	Ridiculous!: Why doesn't he just kidnap her in the suite at the beginning instead of killing umpteen people for no reason in particular, and attracting attention to himself in the process?Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the killer just isn't scary or interesting at all. In fact, he looks bored during the Lisa character's chase scene.The original Prom Night also had a large cast but managed to develop most of the characters at least somewhat. This movie has tons of throwaway characters like the gym teacher, the psychologist, and Chrissy (Lisa's rival for prom queen) -- who could be made interesting, but are instead introduced and then abandoned.Obviously most horror films aren't intended to be high cinematic art, but the good ones at least keep your attention.This "film" is an insult to Prom Night '80!
1994	Too much child pose, no alternative: Tried it, once. Not a success. Given the standing on knees, child pose...etc...my knees screamed NO NO NO! Unfortunately, there were no alternatives (yes, I could create one, but hey--that is what I bought the DVD for right?) His voice off-putting, but would have kept except I had to go to acupuncture to right what this wronged.
1995	The most comprehensive work in print on Hearing: While preparing a new theory of Hearing, and researching widely, I finally encountered the text by Gulick, Gescheider & Frisina. This text designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students is the most comprehensive available even in 2004. The work is far clearer than subsequent texts based on the chemical theory of the neuron. The historical section is one of the few that puts that material in perspective by discusssing both the pros and cons of each proposed theory of hearing. The anatomical drawings actually show precise orientation relative to the head.
1996	Shenmue: This is a great game, that would off been perfect if the fighting systems was better. Besides the fighting system i think its perfect. The graphics (I think are the best on dc hands down)Hve fun with this game!
1997	Lo mejor de la musica Latina: No puedo dejar de admirar tanto talento en cada tema por ellos grabados... espero ver mas CD's por ellos
1998	Better than the first: this was a awsome crazy all out fantastic movie . anyone who is a nd still reads comic boocs will know that this takes it all in full crazy fun.
1999	Adorable: This is so cute! Eggs are smaller than real life - perfect for little hands. Nice hard wood. The carton probably won't hold up forever but that's okay.
2000	Path Between the Seas: Path Between The Seas : The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914I have just started reading this book. I'm most interested in the first part of the book so that I can better understand why the canal was built since I will be cruising through it in March.
2001	Sony cd player: I'm disappointed in this cd player. I only have it a short time and it plays for a few minutes and then stops. It's useless and a waste of my money. You can't listen to something if it keeps stopping and then you have to shut it and start it again in a few minutes.
2002	Awesome techno CD,: Awesome techno CDIt is right up there with Bladerunner.The actual series is better than many shows made today.
2003	Not the Book: As a Tolkien fan, I found the movie very lacking.It didn't follow the story very well and left out several key parts.Other than that, it is a good movie to show 1st graders that have not read the book.
2004	Dry, academic, boring: If you are looking for an encyclopedia of yoga this book is a reasonable consideration. It is, however, very dry, fact-filled, clinical, and boring. I have practiced yoga daily for over 36 years. I also teach yoga. I appreciate the scholarship contained in this book. But it is too academic for most readers. Most readers will want something more engaging from the text. Perhaps this book will serve the needs of those who want a reference book for their bookshelf. Namaste.
2005	Seemed rather shallow and unispiring: I am not really sure what I expected, but I think I expected more than this. I felt the book lacked depth, and I also did not feel that there were any real explanations of how to go about spiritual healing. It seemed to cover the same old ' meditational ' ground over and over, and quite honestly, though I hate to say it, I found it boring.
2006	A [bad], shoot 'em up game: What's wrong with Galaga: DE? The music is great, but the game is not. The stage begins with a classic angle, followed by a side angle and end it with a pilot angle that is hard to shoot from, but easy to kill a swarm. There's no way you can save the game in progress after you turn it off, why?, because you can use up all 3 lives to continue the game. The classic Galaga is better!
2007	Watched Over and Over: Heard about this Anime thru a friend. Watched it about 10 times since owning it. Great Anime
2008	Great CD,a real treat: What else is there that can be said about this band that already hasn't been said. How many three man bands can create this incredible array of music?
2009	One small complaint.: As someone with a shaky grasp of Spanish, I would have appreciated a Spanish/English listing of the lyrics. It would be good to understand the subject matter of the music, even if the lyrics aren't particularly profound.Musically, this is a superb recording - as good as Latin music gets!
2010	great book: This book is really fun. This sums up what we all thought of as children I'm sure! I sent it to a family where they don't get snow along with a pack of instant snow.
2011	Glass Bottom Broke Into Tiny Pieces: We had this scale for about six months when I stepped on it one day and the black glass on the back of the scale shattered. I'm not the lightest person in the world, but not near the 300 pound capacity. It may be that the scale was on the grouting between the floor tiles, but this is unacceptable.
2012	Constant Buzzing and Static - Difficult to Hear Baby: I agree with the above review. We've had this monitor for a year and a half and it's terrible. It always seemed a little noisy but it got increasingly worse as time went on. The buzzing and static got so bad that we could not longer use it in our bedroom because it would keep us up. Luckily by that point my son was sleeping through the night so we could turn t off. Also, we could only use it unplugged for the first month because after that the batteries would drain out really quickly. Then you couldn't tell when the monitor was working or not because there was always just enough battery power to keep the "on" light working - but no sound would come through which meant you couldn't hear the baby. Ugh! The only reason we've had it so long is because we got past the point we couldn't return it and I'm too cheap to go out and buy another. We'll deffinitely buy a different brand with the next baby.
2013	Total Waste of an Academic Career: King James Only partisans love to trot out Hills' work in order to give credability to their odd-ball theories about Bible translations. It is true that Hills was the perpetual student who wandered from university to university until he finally earned his doctorate; albeit with a few academic mishaps along the way such as flunking out of the University of Chicago. his pedagree, rather than vindicating his cause, makes the production of this type of nonsensical rubbish all the more reprehensable. Someone with his qualifications really should have known better, and is therefore without excuse for this book.
2014	Ripped off - never received the MP3: I did everything they asked - I successfully downloaded the MP3 downloader program but the song never downloaded. It is nowhere to be found in my "Amazon MP3" folder nor is it anywhere in my computer. But the Amazon website tries to say that I already downloaded it. Looks like I am a last time customer for Amazon MP3; I-Tunes is much much easier to use and I get the song right away every time.
2015	Great book.BUT on a personal note...: When I found out that a book like this existed, I was so excited since I grew up in East Harlem in the Wagner Projects on East 120th Street and First Avenue through the 60's and 70's. I LOVE the pictures, especially the historic ones from the turn of the century. I loved the one in particular of Park East HS my old school. I think I was even there the day the pictures were taken since I was very good friends of the young lady with the afro!!Anyway, I was slightly disapointed when no pictures of Wagner projects ( a HUGE development!) ..John S. Roberts Junior HS, the old P.S 80 were included, since the author included pratically everything else! Other than that, great book!
2016	movie review: I hate to give this a low rating. The movie was good but the quality that streamed was awful. The picture was horrible for most of the movie. I have high speed Internet and have never had problems when watching netfix so I don't understand why this was so bad. We have tried to watch other amazon programing with mixed results. I will be sticking with directv or netflix from now on.
2017	GREAT MOVIE EXCEPT FOR ONE SCENE...: I absolutely loved this movie, and my wife and I were raving about it, and how we were going to tell all our friends about it. Then there was a scene with 2 men falling in love and stuff. Totally inapropriate, and did not fit in with the theme and feel of the movie. It felt like it was just stuck in. We both thought that scene just did not fit with the rest of the wonderfully done musical.
2018	Eats batteries: Sounded like a good idea.It's handy, light, easy to use.It also fades fast if you leave it on a little too long, and the battery gets drained way too quickly. PUtting one in the corner for convenience's sake is not so convenient when you have to fetch new batteries every fifth tap.
2019	The U.S. is wrong: This book is very interesting. It tells the Cuban side to the economic embargo. Schwab gives specific examples of how the U.S. embargo has hurt the Cuban people. He also provides an idea for an alternative to a U.S. dominated Cuba. Schwab gives us the side of the story that we don't hear from the U.S. government.
2020	Filled with errors: I bought this book to go with the textbook set that was required for my nursing classes. I have not really had a problem with the textbooks but the studyguide if filled with errors. Last time I used it I was thinking I should ask for a refund. There are MAJOR errors in the book (ie answers are wrong). If you learn what is in this book you will learn incorrect information. Maybe the publisher will come up with and updated version. If they do they should offer owners of this version a free correct version. I have never used a book or study guide with this many errors.
2021	Another Great Movie for Ms. Lopez: I could do like some people and give this movie 5 stars, just out sarcastic humor, but I won't. This movie doesn't even deserve sarcasm. It was terrible. Of course I didn't see it, but it's a Jennifer Lopez movie, of course it's gonna be horrible.Honestly, the people who saw this movie should sue Jennifer Lopez and Ben Afflect for false advertisement. They lied and told the public this movie was great. In my opinion, that's worse than the whole Milly Vanilly lip-syncing incident.
2022	Nice watch especially for the price: I was looking for an inexpensive watch that looks somewhat "dressy". The gold face on this watch does just that. The black numbers on the gold face are easy to read for my aging eyes. I like the gold second-hand because it's inconspicuous, but it too is easily seen. My only disappointment is the rubber strap, but I'm sure when that goes, I'll be able to put a nice leather one on to replace it. And my experience is that Casio makes a good watch.I would recommend this product.
2023	Questionable: So, what exactly is "lucky" about being enslaved to be a circus-performer far from ones natural habitat?At one time the circus-director says "All the elephant needed was love". A person would need that. An elephant needs to be an elephant. Please Oprah, be a little more critical and a little less teary eyed.
2024	Madonna Confessions on a Dance Floor [Special Edition]: ok - about the cd - let me tell you that it is one of the best that came out recently and I know it cause my Mum and my Brother likes it and also the guys at work . so nothing more to say than if you have this Cd in your collection - your mornings are much more happier and you go cheery to work .to get it to my house in Israel - it took only 6 Days ! ( 3 workings day ) - that's what you call excellent service !
2025	CF tranfer too Slow: It have nice resolution, but the transfer time to Zip drives are extremely slow!, it take about 30min to transfer a 128mb Compact Flash to a 250M ZIP drive.
2026	10 Year Search Over Very Special Christmas Gift: The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus is one of the rarest of the classic Rankin/Bass Productions. I have been searching for it for over 10 years. This year for the first time ever it was released on DVD. This release has made my Christmas brighter. It is an original recording, and has not been remastered like the others. The quality is not horrible it is what you could expect watching it on cable or VHS. This is a magical wonderful claymation that deserves to be seen by the next generation.I already had Nestor on a previously purchased box set so I have not watched it. The price is well worth it for just Life and Adventures of Santa Claus. Nestor is an added bonus for those who do not own a copy.
2027	SanDisk 4 GB Cruzer Flash Drive with U3: I really like the U3 software that comes with this unit, its nice to have your passwords and logon details all ready to use on any ones computer. I have enjoyed using this drive so much that i just can't wait to use it when i travel. The security of your data is secure.
2028	Don't buy this set if you want high quality latte glasses: This is my first time I have the motivation to write down product review since this product is totally disappointed and made by very poor quality. The first one is that the shape is terrible, not as described as the website pictures. When I saw these at first glance, I almost thought Amazon mails the wrong item. The second one is that these glass are pretty fragile so once you use hot water to clean these cups, they are broken easily. If you want to get high quality and stylish latte glasses, I will strong recommend Bodum. Do waste money on this set unless you can get over 80% discount.
2029	Great toy!: We were walking through a store and my husband found a demo model of this toy and turned it on for my three month old daughter. For the first time in her life she oohed and aahed over a toy. Of course my husband bought it immediately. She is completely captivated by this toy. It has great music thats not plunky like most mobiles and the toys are capivating visually. We took down our mobile that matches her room and this one is here to stay. What a great toy!
2030	Why do they get dull so fast?: When I bought my first Mach 3, it worked great, and the initial blade lasted for about three weeks. The refills that came with it lasted similarly long.Then I bought refills, and each blade was dull within a week and a half.About two years ago, I found a place on the Web that sold cryonically-treated razor cartridges (you can Google for "cryogenically tempered Mach 3 razor"). They were slightly more expensive than most Web retailers, but they last at least three times as long... I'm just now running out of them (I think I bought 32, and gave eight to my dad).Anyway, I only posted this because these cartridges popped up as the top recommendation on my home page. Weird.
2031	Don't Buy: Got my player on Dec 29/07. Downloaded music and played it for 15 daysand that was it. It froze. I called for tech. help and they were happyto help but could not- even got 2 techs that spoke english with no accent.I am suppose to get a replacement - not sure I want one.Might be better for me to get another brand.
2032	Starts off strong, but a disappointing ending: If I hadn't read the last chapter of this book, I would be able to give it a 4 or 5 star easily. But this book, which had great characterizations, characters in the story you could really root for, and a 'surprise' twist near the end (which I saw coming, but I know others might not), completely falls apart in the last chapter. A ridiculous ending that doesn't match up with *ANYTHING* the author wrote in the rest of the book. I very much wish I could go into the reasons *why* it fell apart, but unfortunately to do so would spoil the book for others. Although in my opinion, save your money and don't even bother reading this one. I'm still angry over the ending and it's been 4 days since I finished it. I'm angry that this book was SO CLOSE to greatness, only to fall apart on the home stretch.
2033	I love this album can't wait to get it: Well I love this album I can't not wait to get this album I didn't relize how good it was to just now! I just got the shark tale dvd and now on to this ! ill be buying the soundtrack November 1st!!! when I get more Money$Well my favorite tracks are christina and missy and DI2 can't wait to own it!!!
2034	Poignant and hot tale of clashing expectations: The Kirkus Review I saw here inspired me to express my opinion that this is one of the half dozen best novels about gay men from the last decade or more (with Latin Moon in Manhattan, Landscape/Memory, The Swimming Pool Library, The Waters of Thirst, and The Mysteries of Pittsburgh). It is sometimes very funny, sometimes very arousing, and manages to show that intragenerational misunderstandings can be as profound as intergenerational and interethnic ones. That's a lot for one book to do, and it is also beautifully written.
2035	Not Funny and Not for 12 year olds: Kids are attracted to it as it looks like a good 'cops and robbers' movie. Beware, the language is bad, loads of swearing, loads of sex references, several suicides and the storyline is far from child friendly.Whoever rated it a 12 should take another look at it.
2036	Short Life: Bought 4 pair. WHen they work they sound pretty good. But they each started losing sound out of one ear after about 4 weeks of use. Then eventually out of the other ear. Could jiggle the cord and get sporatic sound. Wires must shear easily causing a short.****** Update*****Company responded to my posting and did a great job providing an acceptable resolution to the issue. I will still purchase products from them. Key for me is a company that stands behind what they sell.
2037	The Rinse Ace is just right!: I love this thing! Sure it could have been made from real metal at the fitting, but that is why it costs so little to buy. It is so great to be able to wash my dogs either entirely or just to clean them up from their usual rolling in the stuff that only dogs roll in.pros: Very easy to use, easy on the back, fitting attachment went on easily.cons: If I forget to turn off the shower the fitting will start to spray = My bad!!Get it. It's worth every cent.
2038	Not for everyday use: I purchased this in January 2010 to use as an everyday replacement for my old bed. For the first three months, it worked great. Very comfortable, quick inflation/Deflation. After that, a coil burst on the upper and lower mattress parts and a queen became two twins. It's not unusable.I bought it because it was a great price for a queen with free shipping on Amazon prime. That was a mistake. I should have spent a little more to get a better quality mattress.If you need a mattress for visiting family/friends, this may work. For everything else, buy something else.
2039	alybar: Boring! Boring! Boring! The same dialogue over and over that just continues. Very little story line just an opportunity to use the dirty sex words over and over. I was just glad that I could resell the book for the purchasing price.
2040	Foiled Plan: After I heard that Chuck Norris could be stopped by someone wearing the Three Wolf Moon shirt, I immediately bought one specifically to find him and, while wearing this shirt, defeat Chuck Norris. Upon wearing this shirt, it instantly guided me to Chuck Norris' location. On my way to visit him, I was followed by a horde of beautiful women. Once I found him and as I was about to destroy him, I saw that he, too, was wearing the Three Wolf Moon shirt, and was awaiting my arrival. Chuck Norris' powers have increased exponentially upon wearing of the shirt, and quickly disemboweled me. Luckily, due to the Three Wolf Moon's natural healing properties, I escaped certain death and fled. Unfortunately, the swarm of women did not follow me back, but instead had their way with Chuck Norris.
2041	What a HORRIBLE script this is...: Well, again after all the hype over this, I pre-ordered it, and watched it last night. What a disappointment! The acting was, as everyone's saying, "top notch", but when it comes to the script - wtf? The movie's boring, not to mention the fact that I personally had a hard time feeling much of anything for either of the main characters. If I want to watch white trash, I'll watch Gummo. If I want rape, I'll watch Irreversible. This merely dabbled in both. Again, this is an art film for non film appreciating AmeriKa... Pretty sad. Good rental for your beer drinking friends, but anyone who appreciates fine cinema will just be let down in the end.
2042	Salaam Namaste Rocks!: This is an amazing soundtrack to go along with an amazing movie! A friend of mine from India actually introduced this to me, and I fell in love! Salaam Namaste and My Dill Goes Mmmmm... have to be the two best songs on the entire soundtrack, but the rest are still full of fun and energy! Highly recommended for those who enjoy love stories!
2043	Great Waffles but Cheap Plasticy Design Broke Quickly: This makes delicious deep waffles, but unfortunately mine broke after about 6 uses. The black handle part is made of very cheap plastic. Part of this plastic fell apart and now mine will not close or turn properly. Comes with a 3 year warranty but now I have to pay for shipping to ship it back and have it repaired. Definitely wouldn't go for this one again.
2044	don't judge by the title: At first I judged this book by it's cover. DON'T DO THIS!This is a really good book. It's about a teenage girl, Kathrine, who meets a Quaker woman and a little girl and they become friends. Then When a bad sickness comes that clames a lot of lives the people blame the Quaker woman, Hannah and Kathrine. Kit leads Hannah to safty with the help of her friend, Nat. Kit is caught and must stand trial.There is no witchcraft or anything in it. It is not a very fast-past book but worth the read.It is a really good book and I would reccomend it to any Christian or non Christian 12 - adult
2045	Panzers galore!: The authors have written a very comprehensive study of German tanks from early prototypes to the Porsche 205 (Maus) and the E-100 series. The selection of photographs is excellent ranging from parade footage to combat in the most bitter European winter. I highly recommend this book.
2046	simple and easy: Love the simplicity of this product...when it is heating up, this is when I put the sandwiches together...my favorite is cheese and avocado and some tomato sauce. Also love that you don't need to spray it with anything because the material is non-stick. Barely any mess...(unless you overload on cheese)...Loving my toasted sandwiches.
2047	Phenominal, even better than Vol. 1: Focusing less on the bloody mayhem of Vol. 1 and more on his typical brand of storytelling and dialogue, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 2 brings his epic homage to a close. Picking up where the first film left off, Vol. 2 finds the Bride (Uma Thurman) continuing her quest for revenge as she hunts down Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Darryl Hannah) in America before finally taking on Bill (David Carradine). The Bride's past is fleshed out and we learn what led up to the massacre at the wedding chapel which left our heroine in a coma and with a thirst for vengeance. Thurman is still perfect in the role she was born to play, and Carradine gives his best performance in years. Still though, you can tell this was a film that Tarantino made more for himself than for the movie going audience. It's still his homage to grindhouse cinema, and it's still as fresh as Volume 1. (...)
2048	All you need to know about Nutrition and its secrets: I am involved in helping tackle obesity in the city kids and have done a lot of research on the subject and find this book of great value.
2049	WONDERFUL: I have a high def box from Cablevision. There are several HD stations, and the picture quality is remarkable. There are channels that are not as good, but on the average, I am quite satisfied. Sometimes there is a bit of "off" skin tones, but I believe that this is the nature of Plazma. You can change the screens from normal to zoom to *wide zoom (*which is where it seems the best picture). and the picture on "pro" looks the best. No picture in picture, if that's important to you. For the price, it is a good value. The sound is great. I have a hearing problem and have added Sennheiser R-120 wireless headphones which pick up every sound, precisely! I would definitely purchase this TV again!
2050	Reviews funnier than movie . . .: Heard that critics hated this movie, but still was hoping for a silly, funny hour or two. SNORE (literally). The first few scenes were surprising and seriously violent, considering that kids would watch it. That was a turnoff. Then, enter the aliens . . . couldn't get any more derivative than that. Not fun visually . . . dark, monotone screen much of the time. Daniel Craig was almost good. Harrison Ford (one of my favs) should stick to serious or totally sardonic roles . . . this in-between stuff is not working. Most of the time, I love a unique, creative approach. This was not one of those times. Shortly into the film, I was getting the image of a bunch of Hollywood honchos having a Monday morning post-hangover boardroom meeting. "How about each of us throw an idea into this hat here, mix 'em up, and pull out two? Put 'em together and we'll have a brand new concept!" . . .I think they all should have taken aspirin and gone back to bed.
2051	Fascinating!: Let me start off by saying that this record is not for everyone. It's a very unique recording consisting of lots electronic ambience courtsey of Mr. Brian Eno and many unique and intriguing sounds collected from around the world. These sounds range from radio show hosts to evangelist speakers to Arabic singers. All of these sounds are mixed to create sound collages that are quite funky. I enjoyed this album a great deal but not at first. This album needed time to grow on me and it might need time for you, too, so if you're looking for instant satisfaction this might not be the album for you.
2052	Boring: This book is a simply written account of a mother & son's recollections of their life. I found it very boring.
2053	Awesome series!!! Gritty but so intricated!: I love this show, was a bit frighten by the pilot somehow but the last 10 min sold it!! The rest of the show is awesome, but not for the faint of heart!!!Blu ray bonuses are ok though they could have gone deeper into the training, fight choreography preparations and a documentary in the real spartacus.I do recommend this set if you watched it on Starz!!!
2054	Looking for more: I am looking for a Korean piano song called "Autumn's Tale" by Korean Drama. I need the sheet music. Can you help me? THANKS Ken Scott
2055	A nice collection: Jane Morgan had only one really important hit on the charts, "Fascination." This song, of course, heads the list of those on this CD. The CD also has a couple of other songs which made minor splashes on the charts, none in the top 10, and a lot of other well-known (if not in her version) songs culled from albums she made for Kapp Records (a minor label on which she and Roger Williams were the only two stars) in the late 1950s. The best song on the CD, of course, is her great recording of "Fascination." But she does good versions of a number of others; the second best song on the CD, I think, is her version of "Love Is a Simple Thing" (best known by Robert Clary in the original cast of "New Faces of 1952").The only track on this CD that I really think is below par is her recording of "Baubles, Bangles, and Beads," which ought to be done at a faster tempo than the way she does it. It isn't really BAD, but I much prefer other versions of the song.Still, I like the CD quite a lot.
2056	Does not work!!: It fits on my t1i but is really wide so it covers some buttons.It is a waste of 10 $.
2057	UPLIFTING FILM EXPERIENCE...: It has been may years since I have seen this film. Since it is now on DVD, I thought it would be a nice addition to my collection. Boy was I ever right! Victor (TITANIC) Garber is outstanding in the lead role, not to mention his awesome voice.The film is brilliantly edited by Alan "All That Jazz" Heim (assisted by the always remarkable Trudy "House of Games" Ship), adding exactly the spark that the film needs, to what is lacking in the choreography department. FOSSE IT AINT!The score by Mr. Schwartz NEVER sounded better, and his most recognizable "Day by Day" is not nearly as wonderful as, "Save the People", "All Good Gifts", and the awesome "All For The Best" (A scene which was partially shot on the top of the World Trade Center with the rest of the NY skyline as a backdrop...see the CD soundtrack cover for visual. The towers were not even completed at the time. Extremely disturbing after 9/11/01.)A must for any fan of musicals and film buffs alike!
2058	Excellent Book, Raises Serious Questions on Evolution: Great Book. Auther has given some very powerful proofs for the Creation. How true it is that Psa 19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork.Book draws some very interesting conclutions in the chart about Noah's Flood.
2059	bad experience: I did not receive the item because they did not get the correct address and was charged for the shipping.
2060	Training DVD-ROM Only!: Please be aware this is actually "Visual Communicator 2 Essentials" Training DVD-ROM. The listing does not indicate the true description of this item. If you are looking for a good place to start and you own this software, then this would be essential for a beginner learning the basics to advanced techniques for this great software. The 1 star rating was based on this listed as Visual Communicator 2, and not indicating that it is only the training DVD-ROM.
2061	POS: We'd rate this thing zero stars if we could. All the features in the world can't make up for the fact that it doesn't [pick up] anything. ... In addition, the hose broke on the first day and it makes a lot of noise for not doing anything. It has been nothing but headaches since we opened the box - poor/incorrect instructions, assembly steps more difficult than necessary, clunky, tippable, short hose, ambiguous cord storage, no tool storage, etc. However, as a trash can, it's got decent wheels and a nice handle.
2062	Rotating Plug: I was looking for a multi-outlet to plug behind my bed. This fit the bill. I really don't need a 8' cord but I can live with it. The low profile of the plug allows this to be used in many areas of the house. Highly recommend this surge protector.
2063	Actually made pain worse!: Canker Covers are a great idea in theory but fall short in practice. Here's why:1. They're too thick. If applied between the lips and the gums, they cause the lips to snag, making it hard to talk or even smile. When wedged between the lips and gum, this thickness puts pressure on the sore.2. They're too dry. Even though they dissolve in time, it still feels like the interface between the canker and the cover is irritatingly dry. Ouch!3. Menthol is an unpleasant sensation. It seems to "perk up" my nerves, which is not a good thing in a wound. I want to numb them!While the covers rid of the periodic, radiating pain of the sores, for me they replaced it with something worse: a steadier, more intense pain.Because of these problems, I've not been able to test the manufacturer's claim that they speed healing.
2064	Retrospective By Leon Russel: I was very happy to find it on Amazon . But was disappointed by the sound that I hear when I play it... Especially on the track Song for you which is my favorite There seems to a defect on the CD and I didn't notice until one day when I played it loud . I feel that I should be able to return it and get a better one. Please advise if this is possible.As I know when I realized it was past the return policy time frame.
2065	Amazing.: This album is absolutely worth 19 dollars. After watching the movie, I knew I'd have to lay my hands on the score as soon as possible. All the tracks are fantastic, although I don't think that the track 'Mass Vehicular Carnage' has anything to do with the rest of the CD, because it's basically a rap song.My favourite tracks are 'The Island Awaits You', 'This Tongue Thing's Amazing', 'Mass Winnings' and 'My Name Is Lincoln'. I'd say that if you like Hans Zimmer's music, this CD is definitely a good buy for you.
2066	Should have read the reviews first: I have done a lot of shopping on Amazon and have found the reviews to be accurate and dependable. Unfortunately I bought this on the advice of Dave Ramsey and did not read the reviews. This book is awful. I have read a lot of self improvement books and this is by far the worst.I persevered to the end thinking (hoping) some structure would emerge. No such luck. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is just an endless string of quotes and stories. Half way through the book I found a reference to a site that sounded like it might be some sort of a form to define your interests. Turns out it was just a veiled advertisement to get you to pay $20 on Dan Miller's web site. Give me a break.Give this one a miss.
2067	Absolutely Incredible.: This album is a voyage into a world where music is truly king. One of the those few cds were almost every single track is exceptional. In this disc you have songs that you can listen to no matter what mood your in. Whether your depressed or angry this an excellent disc to put in the player. If you are looking for a band that is truly original in an age of copycats then tool is a band for you.
2068	Not the Real Deal: Despite the fact that this album has a majority of the band's greatest hits, the Ripper era was not their heyday. Ripper is no Halford.I was fooled into purchasing this album by Ticketmaster. Thought I was getting a new(er) live recording from the past couple years w/ Halford back at the helm, only to find that they're passing off this old stuff as real live JP.If you want to hear classic JP live, do yourself a favor and buy Unleashed in the East instead.
2069	Leverage: How to Create Your Own "Tipping Points"...: In all fairness to the author, I did not read the entire book. I couldn't bare to go on. However, if the second half of the book was as poorly written, sporadic in thought, and self-promoting as the first half...I couldn't have endured the frustration.Chapter after chapter, I waited with anticipation for some meat, some well researched point that I could sink my teeth into, and apply to my busy life. I was disappointed! This book was more of a "tooting of the author's horn" about his world travels, and how he has help his client's succeed... than it was about helping the reader to actually use leverage as a tool of success in business and in life.You would think that a book written on leverage would, at the very least, provide more value than its purchase price. In my opinion...it didn't!
2070	they left out the best: why did they exclude the best song in the movie? "These are Days" Natalie Merchant........I hate it when they leave out songs that were in the movie when they put out the soundtrack.
2071	Most Excellent! Don't miss!: If you've ever secretly thrilled to swashbuckling films with The Great Swashbuckler Himself, Errol Flynn, you will LOVE Beauvallet!If you enjoy the language of Shakespearean times, the color, the pagentry, you LOVE Beauvallet!If you love a great romance, you will LOVE Beauvallet!One of Ms. Heyers earliest published works, it is thrilling to see it newly published in paperback yet again. Heyer is the best of the historical romance novelists; her research makes all her romances ring true, no matter what the period.Rather than the Drawing Room and Comedy of Manners of many of her Regency romances, Beauvallet moves. The story is in constant motion and thus makes it a good starter for a teenaged reader (which is when I first read it).Don't miss it, I truly think you'll absolutely love it! In my opinion, the Best of the Best from the Best.
2072	NOT custom moldedt: Bought one and not as described. It is simply a sturdy box that fits the PSP.THIS IS NOT TRUE AS DESCRIBED "Designed specifically for the PSP, this case has internal custom molding to keep the unit secure while on the go."
2073	An uplifting message of strength, balance, and love: Elderwoman: Reap The Wisdom, Feel The Power, Embrace The Joy by transpersonal psychotherapist and health educator Marian Van Eyk McCain is a "reader friendly" guide to enjoying the years beyond menopause, a time that more women than ever before in human history will be fortunate to see with the longer life expectancies of the modern era. Embracing a woman's relationship to the elements of earth, air, fire, and water, individual chapters cover spiritual matters of learning to enjoy the good things in life, having the courage to speak out in personal and political matters, cherishing one's body and soul, and a great deal much more. A powerful and uplifting message of strength, balance, and love, Elderwoman is strongly recommended for personal self-help reading lists and Women's Studies reference collections.
2074	Awewome: My son cant put this series down. He stays on the edge of his seat and is reading them in the order in which they were written.Reacher is a man with integrity and honor!!
2075	Marble (not-so-fun)ness: The game I've played is not for color, rather the older version.But, it cant be much different.Basicaly, you roll a marble around in a "maze" - well, its not a maze, more you move it around obstacles. The fun part of the game is where you roll you marble in front of a "wave" that carries you, but if you dont get off of it, the marble falls and you have to start again (from where it fell)Overall, I felt the game was okay for a hour or less, but it gets boring after a while. There are more worthwile things to spend your money on.
2076	too short, too basic: This book is to short. I would have assumed that it would be chop full of cases, and that was why it was so short. Wrong! If you like forensic anthropology books that deal with cases in nice greamly detail than you should stay clear of this one.
2077	Great images!: This is a great atlas with photographs of slices, MRI images and more, and FANTASTIC pathways illustrations.
2078	TOO MUCH FLUFF KEYBOARDS!!!!: Im a Hollies freak. On this album, recorded live with Graham Nash, they sing as good as ever. At times a heck of alot better than CS&N; live.However, all the cool guitar parts from their hits are replaced here with a lousy cheapo fluff 80's keyboardS and it really sounds awful. Classic signature guitar riffs are omitted and played on a synth like a cheap vegas lounge act. What a big let down and a weird surprise that Nash would be in favor of reuniting with this great vocal guitar band who's trademark riffs are now done on a DX7.Shame on the Hollies...They sing great but sound like an bad oldies act smothered in keys. RIP Hollies.John Belandwww.johnbeland.com
2079	Disappointed: The product folds easily so it sets up in just a minute but it came in so badly scratched I am embarrased to display it.
2080	great story and innovative techniques: Jaqui Schiff innovated an effective therapy that actually provided cure for what most of the medical/psychological establishment considers incurable. That alone would incite disparagement from commercial interests whose livelihood depends on treating and medicating, rather than addressing causality. I trained in the reparenting methods she innovated and can attest to their validity and effectiveness. What was her secret? she listened to what her clients were saying, responded to what was legitimately a cry for help and learned what they needed. I met and trained with Arron and found him to be not only healthier than most therapists, but quite intelligent, as well. To denegrate Schiff and her methods as cultish is pure prejudice, without any semblance of truthful information.
2081	Good item: Works as advertised i just wish the suction cups would stay in there holes when i try to remove it from the window.
2082	Level 42: I have been a big fan of Level 42 since high school and this CD brings back a lot of great memories. The quality of the product is great and I am really happy to have this CD. Even my sons are listening to the CD.
2083	Great Item. Definetly worth it.: I have been saved. The Beechwood cart is great. It gives you storage space and counter space as well. It works well right next to my stove because they are the same height. My wife loves me for purchasing this item. As she says "I am happy to know you know what I want. I definetly made the right choice." I too feel that I made the right decision.
2084	OEM Battery Fit Perfectly: This battery arrived much sooner than I thought it would. When installing it, I found it to be a direct replacement which did not need any modifications to get it installed, etc.. Charged it up, and all is well after several months of use.
2085	This book has missed the boat: Candace Bushnell should be thanking the writers of the TV series because this book is horrible and a waste of time. I always saw it at the bookstore and thought I would read it.I wish I would of just keep walking passed it. She was trying to hard to make it edgy and dark but it just came out as poorly executed.Don't waste your time reading this just watch the TV series. This is like a bad accessory you can't wait to take off.
2086	only if your a hardcore evangelion fan: This was a real let down for me. When i saw on the box that it was almost 2 hours long i was realy happy, i was expecting it to be a movie, but insted it tournd out to be nothing but a cheesy colash of jumbled flashbacks from the series, only about 25 to 30 minuts is original, and the extras were pretty pathetic. i would only suggest this only for hardcore evangelion fans like me who wernt happy with the confusing and meeningless ending of the originalseries.
2087	Norman Vincent Peale is great!!: I am a fan of Norman Vincent Peale. I bought this book knowing exactly what I was getting....another great life book based on God.Thanks!!
2088	No photos of the plants.: I bought this book in hopes of learning which weeds are edible. The biggest part is knowing what they look like. This book does not have photos of the plants. Very disappointing.
2089	Great Cd: Shane Owens is a great singer. If you like good slow or fast country music you will like this cd Shane has some slow music and some fast music.
2090	5 Stars: I really like these headphones! I got them to replace the little buds that were always falling out of my ears during my power walk. They are comfortable and great value for the money. I use them with my mp3 player. Highly recommend! Only problem is the size; I had to get a larger container to store them.
2091	A glimpse into genius at work: Writers are endlessly second-guessing their work habits, their ideas and their purpose. As a novelist myself, I found this work-in-progress comforting, because it showed that even the greatest writers struggle with "The Process." Fitzgerald's inherent talent shines through, despite the incomplete nature of the work. The notes and other addenda helped shape the story even further for me, leaving it perhaps more fascinating for the wonder of what Fitzgerald might have done had he not died so young. I have groused in the past about the release of several Hemingway books after his death, and none has come close to the feeling of this unfinished work, but I cannot dispute the value to the reader of seeing these words, these last words, of one of America's greatest novelists. I am happy I got the chance.
2092	Mixed examples and broad strokes that can mislead: The authors attempted to cover too much ground and have a very spotty record of being helpful. I have trained people for 40 years how to integrate faith and counseling and it is a challenge to do it rightly and ethically. One of the articles in this volume on using Rational Emotive Therapy used a strong Christian teenager who was confused and upset with his homoerotic temptations. The therapist, IMO, was unethical in promoting his own pro homosexual ideas mixed with RET to try to change the young man's convictions. He had obviously was a novice in working with same sex attractions and never asked the client permission to take the cognitive tack in trying to convince the teen that homosexual behavior was acceptable.By bringing so many different people with different views of spirituality and different views of therapy the result is a very mixed up bag that will be unhelpful to most Therapists.
2093	Very thin, break easily. Avoid!: I use these gloves for auto repair but they break so easily. I would recommend another product over this. Just too thin!
2094	Lousy Quality: Broke within three days of play. It was a gift so I couldn't return in it.Melissa and Doug toys always fill me so much regret. Spend a little bit more and find a more attractive, less likely to be toxic, more ethically manufactured quality. This isn't it.
2095	Bumbling repeated à la Scott: I found this book interesting, in that it sought to vindicate Scott's use of manhauling to get to the South Pole (as if the technological improvements in clothing and skis made in the 75 years since Scott's expedition wouldn't make a difference!). But what really makes the book entertaining is that, true to form, Mear and Swan bumbled their way through THEIR expedition, just like Scott did. In fact, if the US Air Force hadn't had a base at the South Pole, and hadn't been willing to fly Mear and Swan back to the coast, the authors would've DIED trying to make it back, just like Scott did, thereby proving just exactly what Mear and Snow wanted to disprove: that manhauling is an IDIOTIC venture at best!
2096	Great Music: I'm learning guitar and Roy Orbison's songs are great for me. It was so easy to get this CD from amazon.com. The price was right and the CD was new. I recieved it in the time frame promissed. I have downloaded music from amazon.com and that was easy also. This is so much easier than going to the store and looking for a hour and still not finding what I want.Thank you amazon.
2097	A good summer read: I was a bit confused when I began this book; I thought it was only about the character Roxanne as a 12 year old. It is actually the story of a small town girl, Roxanne, as she grows up in the wonderful small town of Annette, Texas. Each chapter deals with a fragment of her growing up moving from baseball, to best friends to nail polish and love. Intertwined in all that is the lives of her parents and other family and the loved ones who come and go. It feels very true to the time and place, beginning in Annette in 1962 and moving where time takes her. The characters are interesting and true to life and very likable. The recopies throughout are actually pretty good, the fudge sauce divine. It is a slice of life in the 60's and 70's and anyone who ventures to Annette, Texas is in for a treat.
2098	Good Source Book, Bad Mechanics: If you want a book to tell you all about different starships in the Star Wars universe, give you plenty of D20 RPG stats, and tell you how to modify ships, this book is for you.If you want a book that gives you playable rules for space combat, you are out of luck. The new combat system is just as screwed up as the main RPG version. For Space Combat, go see Star Wars Gamer magazine #8.
2099	not so much...: moved around a bit too much for our purposes (help w/ toilet training for my 4 yr old) and bed ended up wet anyway - if we put it under the fitted sheet it helped keep the mattress safe but kind of defeats the purpose
2100	I liked it: It's pretty much your typical romantic comedy, but depending on your movie taste, you might enjoy that. In the credits, Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor sing a song together. The video for the song is included in the DVD. It's one of my favorite parts of the movie. The movie has some dirty parts, and they're hilarious. Overall, it's a really cute movie.
2101	A NASCAR Lovers Dream: If your a hard core NASCAR lover I would recomend this movie, youll see a bunch of legendary drivers doing camios. Too include the very best Dale Earnheart!!! And there all back when they were just coming into the sport its a blast seeing them all so young!!!The Chemistry between Burt and wife Loni is great to bad they wound up divorcing!! Youd never guess by this film!Jim Neibors away from his normal " Gomer Pyle" is great.I would also recomend if you like Burt and Jim in this that you see them in "The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas", also with Dolly Parton doing her famouse song,that Whitney Huston stole and ruined, "I will always love you".
2102	Great movie, with a good lesson.: Nausicaa of the valley of the wind is yet again another great story about the ignorance of mankind. This movie, along with other titles by miyazaki, never fail to humble my agressions. The unrelenting heart that Hayao Miyazaki portrays here is a spectacle to behold, reminding us all of the compassion we are capable of. Paralleling the greed of our negligence that we as a society hold towards our own planet, the story of Nausicaa is here told in the gentle yet firm style of this master of story telling and production genius.
2103	Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing: A look into American Racism: Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing is a riveting look into the life of a multi-cultural block in New York City. The film's theme song " Fight the Power" is the repeated point that reveals the true meaning behind the movie. Characters weave in and out of the film leaving the audience with a sense of knowledge and caring for each and every one of them. The hottest day in NYC serves as a colorful backdrop for the group of diverse characters. Lee's portrayal of Mookie, a lazy pizza delivery man, allows the audience to follow his struggle to co-exist in the tense world. The climax and finale of the film is a heartstopping sequence that thrusts a multitude of hatred at the audience. The film leaves one in a slight state of shock and gets it's point across very clearly.
2104	This kit will do the job: All the parts necessary for a normal rebuild are included in the kit.The only negative in this kit is the main body gaskets are not the blue non-stick materialavailable from other sources. The product description says ethanol resistant gasketsand I believe they are, but I would of preferred the newer blue body gaskets.
2105	These are Great Measuring Cups!: We bought these cups after our glass measuring cup cracked. These cups are plastic - but seem very durable. The OXO line is known for ergonomic design - and these do not disappoint - the handles fit nicely in your hand. The cups have the regular measurements on the outside of the cup, but also on the inside. The inside measurement allows you to look down into the cup while you're pouring so you don't have to constantly check with the outside to see how much you've poured. It's a brilliant idea and something I don't think I could live without now that I've experienced it!
2106	Can you say boring!!!: The only good metal gear was the 1st one. Or the actual gear that was metal, it is real! But really all the games so far have sucked bid time. Playing the games are like watching really stupid movies that don't make sense. You have to be a real loser to like some hippy that wheres a headband and has a lame name like "snake". But there is a cool hero called "Master Chief" that would kick stupid snakes ass. Instead of buying another lame game just get halo or halo 2, doom3, halflife 2 or any game because it will have to be better that more of this metal crap.
2107	boring toy: We were dissapointed with this toy. The volume is very low, unusual for a childs toy, can barely hear whats its saying. My daughter played with it for 2 minutes then threw it aside. The only time she plays with it is throwing it in and out of the toy chest.
2108	Spanish-English Dictionary Covers the Basics and More: I'm glad to add this book to my collection. It is a handy, clear reference book that contains more than just definitions; it also includes usage examples.
2109	This music is insulting!!!!: One horrible band has split to make two horrible bands. They're like Gremlins, please keep them away from water!!! It sounds like a horrible tribute band of every 90's has been. It could be a bunch of Guitar Center rejects playing half ass Soundgarden covers. Just terribly insulting that this type of music is produced and pushed on music listeners. Anybody who appreciates real thought provoking music should avoid this CD at all costs. This could be almost as bad as Creed, I haven't got the stomach to listen to Scott's solo album, so I can't bring him into this. These guys would do well on American Idol, because it fits that mindless, cheesy, empty droning that you hear from that show.
2110	this is great stuff...................: this is some of the greatest "unknown" soul music ever recorded. If you get this CD plus the "Soul Gems" CD, you've got all the great soul you're ever gonna need......
2111	Not Sure What All the Hype is Over: Poorly acted. Plot lines, while I realize that this is tv, are so far fetched it is ridiculous. So many events that happen are so silly, my wife and I did virtually nothing but yell at the tv asking how that "event" makes any sense...OK, so you have these sophisticated terrorists trying to arrange these two assassinations, but their whole plot hinges on the abduction of a teenager by two dim-witted dope heads. How in the world these two are able to drive around in that van and never get pulled over by the cops is astounding.All that being said, we watched all the episodes...why I don't really know, but we did.UPDATE: Well, season 1 was silly, but we bought and watched all of the rest and we are hooked. Although the last season, season 5, was kind of repetitive. But we still love the series.
2112	Scent: This is the first time I have ordered a essential oil on line without being able to test the scent. I found the scent not the same formula as I have purchased in the past. It is a thinner, and I have to use more of the product.
2113	not so good: I have to start by saying that the scenery was very pretty in some parts of the movie. However I bought this movie for my eight yr old daughter, and the actors had such an accent that even I couldn't understand what they were saying. The "actors" were very poor on acting. Sadness and Joy were only shown through a facial expression. Peter was a grumpy brat who threatened to slap a baby goat. My main complaint though is just the lack of decent acting on the part of the characters. Nobody was very convincing. I would not recomend wasting your money on this feable attempt of a movie
2114	Great!: Great! Love the show! Every episode ends with a cliffhanger. Everybody dies at the end. Lots of suspense. But it now!
2115	What the heck is this?: A bunch of conservatives used this li'l film to bash Moore, Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Good show! See you at the Oscars!
2116	magic lost: Watching movies from the pass is to recover, not only the images, but the memories and impact it had on you. If the movie is not the same the magic doesn't work. It's a different movie. And I won't take a movie with FX of today and haircuts from the 70s. The Empire Strikes Back is the one I like most. Thank God this one has not been mutilated. For me all the other movies of the saga have become extras I have included on my Empire dvd box (they hardly fit). The same goes for Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.
2117	Great Customer Service Fixed The Problem: I bought one of these at Walmart and LOVED it, UNTIL about a week later, it just quit working. After going through the problem solving techniques offered in the owners manual, I decided to call the company.The customer service was EXCELLENT. The person I spoke with gave me a few other tricks to try, to see if we could get it to work again. When that failed, she told me they'd go ahead and get a new one to me.All I had to do was mail in the battery compartment lid, as well as $10 for shipping and handling.My replacement LitterMaid box arrived in a reasonable amount of time and has been working just fine, since.I'm very pleased to see that this is a company that will stand by their product and are supportive of their customers. I'll always be a lifelong customer. Had my situation been handled any differently, I would've refused to buy another LitterMaid product.
2118	WWII Movie: Poorly directed Movie. Boring, at times I didn't know if I was looking at comedy, or a dark comedy, or why this film was searching for a reason to be serious.
2119	Leaves something to be desired.: After I rescued 2 beta fish from very poor conditions, I needed some really good information on their care. I did not find it in this book. It has a couple paragraphs about diseases, absolutely no charts or diagrams for biology or anything, and while the pictures were really beautiful, they had nothing to do with the topic on the same pages. There is a lot about how to have beta fights, and speaks of it in a very condoning tone! This is quite cruel and inhumane. There is I grant you some decent very basic info that you could glean off the internet yourself in an hour or two.
2120	A Different and Unique Girl: Stargirl a girl that came from home schooler to High schooler at Mica High school. She wasn't trying to fit in, and she wasn't into fashion either. She dress herself with skirt down to her feet, her eyes where big and her hair was sandy. She was sweet and kind, but she shouldn't stick up like that because her friends hammered her down. The only friend that she had at that time was Leo Borlock. The guy that felt in love with her, althought she was a totally different girl from the High School Girls, he felt in love with her.I recommed you this book, because the author Jerry Spinelli has write great books for kid and teenagers. He has a lot of stories that came from his experients with his wife and with his 7 Childrens. Jerry dedicates Stargirl to his Wife and childrens.
2121	Bratty Brittney: the book just proved to me that she's just a spoiled monster who gets everything she wants and did not work for her fame. i'd give it zero stars but that isn't an option
2122	The tortured heroine is not quite my thing.: I did not like the tortured heroine concept, besides the pacing was sometimes slow and the ending was to easy to see coming.
2123	Waste of time: Why do a remake if it fails in every way compared to the original. Special effects are embarrassing. Acting is ok but not worth watching.
2124	Lost in translation: I rented this film and forced my best friend to watch this with me after hearing all this fan faving on the film. I'm open to new experiences. In return, I got nothing. This is the work of genius? This is nothing but a strange and weird animation. First clue to the reviewer that giving tips on how to watch this movie: a movie shouldn't need cliff notes. Nothing, and I do mean nothing in this film makes one ioda of sense to me and I can't believe I'm wasting more time in posting a review this garbage.
2125	Good functions, poor quality hardware & software: I was disappointed in this printer. We purchased it despite some negative reviews because it was the only product that had all of the features that we wanted. It was a mistake. The software is hard to install, buggy, and *HUGE*. It has difficulties staying on a DHCP network with my linksys hub because it doesn't report a hostname (not sure whose bug that is, but if it reported a name like it should it wouldn't matter). Photo print quality is OK, but didn't excite me. Dual trays sound exciting, but it doesn't automatically switch from an empty one to one with paper, so what is the point?Then to wrap it up, it failed after 16 months of very light use, 2 hours with tech support resulted in the same offer as a previous poster: we'll sell you a new one at the same price as as on amazon, and you should buy an extended warranty (unstated: because we make shoddy product).Do what you want, I am avoiding HP printers for now on.
2126	PRETTY SILLY: Not a serious book about sexual terminology. Most of the terms from Aah to Zipper are familiar and the definitions given are more silly than informative. OK for a teenager, but if you are a serious adult, look elsewhere. Even if you are not a serious adult, there is funnier stuff out there.
2127	Memoirs of a Geisha: I really enjoyed this movie. I thought is was very well done and it kept my interest. I don't think my husband enjoyed it as much as I did, so I guess it was more of a chick flick.
2128	Pirated DVD set, but awesome show: I bought this DVD set for my sister for Christmas. I love this show, so my rating is not to reflect my opinion of the show, but of the fact that Amazon needs to stop selling pirated DVDs. This is without a doubt a pirated copy. This is not the first time I have received a pirated DVD from Amazon, but it will be my last. I will no longer be purchasing DVDs from them.
2129	not bad...: i got this after having an emjoi for 10 yrs that finally broke. it's honestly not bad, especially considering that it's half the price. sometimes it only manages to cut the hairs, not yank them out, but i found that with the emjoi, that happened too. so far, no real complaints.
2130	ERICA HANSON IS A DUMMIE :D: My girlfriend purchased this particular album and honestly I reefed it out of my car stereo after about 3 songs snapped it in two and tossed it out my driver side window, and then handed her 20 dollars for her loss. I felt it would be fun to share this story and couldn't help but snicker at a review posted on this album by one ERICA HANSON. I read it and saw what she said about FEELING everything in jennifer lopez' music and was tickled. Get a clue girl, she's rich you aren't you have no idea what it's like to be her but keep dreamin :D
2131	A collector's item only: I love Dream Theater, but this one is simply a collector's piece to let you know how the great band got its start. If you want to check out Dream Theater, try another CD. I seldom listen to it.
2132	Beware: These are not designed for 120 volts as we have in the US. The box has prominent disclosure (which is no where on the website description) that they are designed for 130 volts and if used at 120 volts only give off 1290 lumens as opposed to 1700 (25% less light for the same number of watts).
2133	1 Big Flaw: While this would seem to be a cool way to transfer information between different computers and even a PDA, the Cruzer is too deep and wide to fit properly in most USB ports. If you have a typical computer (i.e., a keyboard and mouse connector and below it 2 USB ports), the Cruzer does not fit in the USB port if the keyboard and mouse are plugged in. It also doesn't fit if a USB device is plugged in, as it is too "fat". You must use a 4" dongle that comes with it to plug it into such places, that dongle is easily lost, and the dongle does not easily fit into the carrying case that comes with the product.In principle, it works well. But in practice, being too bulky and not plugging into the usb port at the back of a typical computer without the aid of additional, easily lost parts is a real drag. You'd be better off with a smaller memory key-like device, or if you have a PDA or camera, it's a lot cheaper just to buy a data cable instead.
2134	Trite Truisms: Oddly enough, this book doesn't say anything deep or meaningful that we haven't already heard before. While the message may be a good one, it's obvious, everyone knows it, and ultimately I was asking myself... what's the point? Also, it's like one long lecture rather than a story. So if you're looking for plot or adventure - steer clear.The good news is that it's short, so it won't waste too much of your time. I'm aware that many people were touched by this work. All I can say is "good for them." I wish I knew what I was missing.
2135	A useful handy reference: Verilog is my preference in coding HDL. This book is detailed enough for a beginner, and helps the more experienced, as a organized, quick handy reference book. It doesn't go into much gory details in examples, which i feel is helpful. It lacks detail in coding techniques for synthesis. The PLI topics are just breezed through.In general a good guide in Verilog.
2136	He's green, he's mean...but seldom seen: This is a long boring movie. Stan Lee revolutionized comics by adding an emotional and psychological background to the standard superhero story line. But this technique was just a frame to add depth to the main story of adventure, threat and action. This film focuses on the emo/psych part, leaving a piddling amount of screen time to the action part. This genre screams for action, not endless background plot. Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly both appear to be sleepwalking thru their parts. Nick Nolte scares everyone within acting distance by an emotionally drenched method acting demonstration. There is not one scene containing humor, fun, wonderment, adventure, or any kind of thrill whatsoever. This film is a major misfire.
2137	to much bark, not enough bite.: i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it. i heard that it was the most violent film ever made. i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better. i was dead wrong. cannibal ferox is a boring, unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation. im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys. the few gore scenes are pretty effective, but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws. if it was for giovanni lombardo radice[one of my favorite italian horror actors] starring in it, cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star.
2138	great flicks: Just got this recently, been watching it regularly, one of the greatest comedy series out there. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good comedy series from this era.
2139	You get what you pay for: I moved to a new house last year and discovered my Cuisinart Coffeemaker wouldn't fit under the counter. With expenses mounting from the move, I went out and purchased this B&D model. The other reviewers were on target. It makes nothing but a mess when filling the water resevoir or just pouring a hot cup of coffee. I've learned to scoot the maker right to the edge of the sink to help avoid excess cleanup. It makes a mess! The brew basket requires some force to remove too. I finally learned to just carefully extract the used filter with grounds after exerting too much force a couple of times. With some force, the basket would pop out, sending wet grounds all over the place. I've finally given up on this coffee maker now that the non-stick surface has worn in several places. The plate is beginning to rust and I'm a little concerned about it rusting through and creating a fire/electrical hazard. It does make a decent cup of coffee but it's poorly designed and made.
2140	Another great vampire story: Love the sookie stackhouse stories. entertaining and a very easy read. i recommend these books to anyone who likes a good vampire story or anyone who likes mystery stories.
2141	interesting story about an interesting place: this is such an interesting place in the world- my wife an I visited it a couple of years ago. Inca history is remarkable, and the area is incredibly beautiful, but life is hard there. Karin describes bith very well in this very interestin book. If you are planning to travel there, you really should read this book
2142	I would give this a 3.5 star rating: The mirror seems to work fine on the 5X side. I switch to the 10X and it works but is a little distorted. For me I like the way it mounts because it is simple. This has a backing plate that 3 suction cups mount to which is the base. The mirrors has a threaded chrome goose neck that thread into the back side of each mirror. Choose which side you prefer and the side you are not using slides into the mounting base. pretty simple set up.
2143	Great Control: I like to pill fruits and vegetable just under the skin. This Rada Paring Knife gives me the control I have wanted. Always sharp and a good price.
2144	Pyle Sub: Great sounding subwoofer for the price. I built my own ported speaker box for this 12-inch sub. Hi level of bass out put.
2145	WASTE OF MONEY: PURCHASED WESCLOX TIAD DIGITAL ALARM CLOCK MODEL#66705... WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. ASIDE FROM RUNNING A LITTLE FAST, THE ALARM DOES NOT WORK, THE BATTERY BACK UP DOES NOT STORE ANY INFORMATION, AND THE NUMBERS ARE LARGE AND VERY BRIGHT WITH NO DIMMING FEATURE. WHY WOULD I NEED THIS CLOCK?
2146	Winnie: The VHS is probably good but was broken so did not get to watch it. It has been returned without any problems.
2147	Misogynistic, racist, and incompetent: As a writer, Monroe would make a good dish washer or garbage collector. Scanning the book, I cannot find any redeeming quality. The writing is poor; the magick is constrained, poorly thought out, and uninspiring. The "scholarship" is lacking: since when have potatoes and pumpkins ever "dotted the English countryside" in Arthurian times?! Potatoes and pumpkins (and corn) are NEW WORLD crops. The rampant racism could be excused if it were presented as only the author's opinion, but it is NOT excusable when it is presented as historical and scholarly.
2148	Song list titles: The O'neal TwinsBrother You & ISong List:Side One1. Except The Lord Build The House 4:122. He Can Work It Out For You 5:073. Beams of Heaven 4:094. I Just Can't Tell It All 3:23Side Two1. My King 4:092. Brother You And I 4:403. I Owe It All To Jesus 3:044. It's In your Hands 4:055. These Signs 4:406. I Have Another Building 4:45
2149	Not for anyone with arthritis in their hands: I have had this coffee maker for about 6 months now and I think I've decided that I just don't like it. I have the beginnings of arthritis in my hands and trying to open the carafe first thing in the morning when my hands are still a bit stiff is a real challenge. To keep the coffee hot the lid has to be on pretty tight and I find it very difficult to open. I too have had the problem with the filter falling over and getting the pot full of grounds. I guess if it weren't for the difficult lid I might spring for a permanent filter but I think I'll just get another machine.
2150	wha happen'?!: What on earth has happened to this band? I was such a fan untilI was able to really listen to this, which only made it more difficult to write this. Karma in contrast, was such a heart feltwork of art, but this album seemed to be driven by something elselike record execs or some outside force. songs seemed to only climb half way up before they got annoying. Hopefully the canstep back down and try again!
2151	great addition to daily life: this has become a must in our home - rely on it every morning to determine the best dress selection to match the weather - start every day with the time and temperature
2152	very cool and good experience: This is a very good wheel. It's the first one i've bought, but i like it alot. I use it with the force feedback up 150%, and it feels very realistic. You can tell that there is a plastic notchyness, in there when u turn it fairly fast, but it's easily overlooked. I use it to play Need for Speed Underground 2, and NFS Most Wanted, and it makes the game seem so much more realistic. when i drive over cobblestone or on the dirt, it feels like i'm driving over it. plus, i can tell when i have no traction when i'm drifting or in the air, the wheel goes loose on me and it spins freely. I would have liked it more if it was like a real car, with the clutch and the 5 speed stick (or 6) cause that's howi'm used to driving, but i can get used to the stick. It is a big change from using my joystick, but i'm getting used to it more and more each time i use it.
2153	Arrived with casing cracked thru in 3 places: I have has this shredder once before and after three years and 1000s of pages shredded it died...despite oiling teeth etc. ordered a replacement and it arrived...turned out it was 'open box' and when I unpacked it the casing was cracked thru in at least three places...soooo disappointing I will not reorder as I cannot trust Acedepot to sell me a new perfect condition/sealed box...
2154	Okay: The acting was good, but the story was simplistic and predictable. The only events that happened were ones that demonstrated how the boy was exactly what the couple had wished for, thereby making the movie contrived and shallow.
2155	Appreciationg Death to appreciate life: This is a great documentary and explains the many ways people die or kill each other. It provides an appreciation for death and the vest for life after you see this documentary. For those who like to seek wisdom or simply like to see a freak show don't pass up on this one.
2156	Much smaller than looks in pic but works great: Works great. You gonna have to use a cup and tare the scale to use it. Its really small but worth the price.
2157	Pricey: It wasn't as good as I would expect it to be. I thought it would give you some awesome hints of how to use the camerea to make it easy. But it's basically the same thing as in the book that comes with the camera. And I also thought it was a book, but it's not a book. I found it very pricey for what it's suppose to do..
2158	Kindle version differs from the hard copy version: Simply put, the questions in the kindle version differ greatly from the ones in the hard copy. Additionally it also has the strange pages that are all blank except for a vertical line running down the middle of the page. I would not recommend this book.
2159	no appetite curbing: These taste good. They do not curb my appetite and they are sooo expensive! I used them to help with sugar craving on the hcg diet. Helped with craving but Im going to try sugar free pops?
2160	ANOTHER CLASSIC!!! WHERE WERE YOU NASTY NAS???: IT WAS ABOUT TIME FOR SOMEBODY TO PUT THE RAWEST OF HIP HOP IN A DEFINITELY NEW CLASSIC! ILLMATIC WAS PURE DOPE, GOD'S SON IS THE VERY LIKELY TO BECOME THE BEST HIP HOP ALBUM EVER. FROM THE INTRO TO THE SECOND CD EVERY TRACK LEAVES A CLEAR MESSAGE, THERE WAS NOT ONE BAD SONG IN STILLMATIC, THIS WAS A GREAT ALBUM, THE CLOSEST THING TO ILLMATCI, BUT GOD'S SONG IS EVEN GREATER, AND THIS ALBUM IS NOT CLOSE TO ILLMATIC, THIS ALBUM SURPASSED IT BY FAR. IF YOU WANNA BUY A QUALITY ALBUM, REAL HIP HOP, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GET GOD'S SON. I BOUGHT 3 ALBUMS CUZ I'M SURE THAT THIS ALBUM IS GONNA SELL IN BIG NUMBERS SO I GOT ONE 2 TO GIVE AS CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.
2161	Blah: Too much back and forth. I didn't like the dialogue it was really boring! I just wanted to through the book down
2162	Parnell at his best!: Even though Back to the Well has been out for a few years I just got around to buying it and I love it. Lee Roy has been a favorite of mine for years and it was so easy to order and get the CD from Amazon.com. I've ordered several products and I've never had one problem. I love it!
2163	Pour me some Les Nubians!: Five stars isn't half enough to rate these fabulous sisters! I feel as if I've been in the Sahara, waiting for a drink, and Les Nubians is better than any oasis. I am uttterly in love with this CD, and music hasn't moved me like this in a long time. I said I wouldn't buy anymore sub-par dreck until I heard something real- and this is it. Buy it- you'll love it, too!
2164	best game ever ,with a few flaws: I am an serious and experianced fligth simmer.I have every simulaer and top of the line $100+ joysticks. I found this under a PC PILOT MAGAZENE ****star revue that lead me to buying this amazing sim.If you take the time to do the tutorials this game is aweosme, with realilistic AI and hundres of modes. But it has one major flaw that led me to e-baying it: you have to memorise tons of keyboard combinations to change to a difrent gun, from AIR TO AIR ,AIR TO GROUNG,CANNONS, ect. rent it of try a frends befor you buy. UNTILL THAN KEEP AWAY!
2165	Oh how the mighty had fallen!: When you see this insanity, you want to say "Oh how the mighty have fallen" when you see Bela Lugosi in this mess! What a comedown! Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis on welfare! Here, Lugosi is a mad scientist who turns the Dean Martin copycat into a gorilla so that he (Lugosi) could have the beautiful heroine all to himself. The faux Jerry Lewis does an extremely weak imitation of the "master." Folks, ths must be seen (if you can stomach it) to believed! This film is as outrageous as it's title and makes "Gilligan's Island" look like "Gone With the Wind." YUCK!
2166	Fun sequel: Fun movie. We defiantly enjoyed it! worth purchasing if you like a mermaid tale! It followed right along where in sequence with the first. And it's not annoying to watch or listen too a couple of times in a row!
2167	Great little punch!: Perfect for my needs. The punch punches easily and cleanly. And I love that the little punched-out pieces are caught and don't get scattered about.
2168	One of the WORST movies ever.: (I would have given this 0 stars, but you have to put at least 1) Simply put: This movie was long, confusing, boring.... and well, it just tried to be too "artsy." And the worst part is, when you think the movie is finally over, you get a whole hour more to suffer. I almost walked out on this movie, but I went on opening night, and I sure wasn't going waste my money. I kept thinking that maybe in the end I would at least get something out of it. Well, I was wrong. This movie was a waste of time.
2169	A terrible book.: This book can't compare with Wolfe's other notable works like "The Right Stuff" and "Bonfire of the Vanities". It's boring, repetitive and tedious. I have to wonder if the professional reviewers who raved about this book actually read it.
2170	Very appropriate title...: If you seen these guys live, then you know the mayhem and drunken debauchary they incite at their shows, and this Robbie Burn's Day gig is no exception. Shot at the historic Commodore ballroom in Vancouver, it features the McKenzies "pissed tae th' gills" (as usual) and in fine form having just come off a grueling tour. There is some great footage of the lads walking around Granville street with a platter of haggis, making people try it before letting them know what the ingredients are - even a beat-cop gets to sample some.One minor complaint I have is that there is no real insert booklet to read through. They should have included some extra info/credits and maybe even pictures but instead left it minimalistic, leaving curious fans wanting more.Overall, if you like The Real McKenzies, and their brand of music, you will surely get a kick out of seeing this DVD.
2171	Princess Bride: This was a book I read years ago and wanted to share with my daughter. Both of us enjoy this movie and I knew she would love the book as much. It came in time for Christmas and she was pleased with the gift!
2172	Why we can say the author is a pro-communist...: The Words of Mr. Unko Tamezo is basically true. Most of Mr. Yoshimi's books are published from Otsuki Shoten Pub. and Iwanami Shoten Pub., both well known as pro-communistic publications. Esp. No anti-communists want to publish their books from Otsuki Shoten. Please remember Korean people is totally in the dark by the Korean government. All both compensations were completed by the Japan-(South) Korea Basic Treaty (1965). So, their acts are a sort of duplicate billing.
2173	Big Country's masterpiece: This is a great album. Big Country has its own sound and its own style with clucking guitars, pattering drums, and lush, dreamy lyrics. And with that style they create their own poppy songs, like "Inwards" and "1000 Stars," as well as epics like "The Storm" and "Porrohman." What can I say: it's brilliant. Repeated listenings make me sad that they couldn't hold onto that sound in later releases. This is Big Country at their beginning, and at their peak.
2174	Talent: From the title, I thought this CD contained 20 hits of the Hermanos Carrion when in fact it is a mixed of bands.These bands had talent but lacked good musical direction. Nevertheless, for the period they recorded, late 50's into the 60's the songs were popular with the teens.You can enjoy.
2175	Helpful for first time Moms: This book is pretty big and a lot to read for anyone, especially a new Mom who has her hands full with a newborn. I would recommend reading it while still pregnant to find out about what to expect when you begin nursing, and simple solutions to common problems BEFORE you experience them. After baby is born, this book is useful as a reference or support guide from day one through toddlerhood. It discusses the mother-child bond, nutrition and proper diet for baby from her first foods to the terrible twos. I've used this book more as a reference from time to time, turning to the chapter that most fits my need. The stories other Moms share are relatible and supportive. This is a wonderful book for Dads too because it helps men to understand the sacred, unspoken bond a mother shares with her nursing baby.
2176	Very interesting Film-Noir: House on Telegraph Hill with Richard Basehart, Valentina Cortese, and handsome looking William Lundigan is a early interessting and also thrilling movie about a woman, played by Valentina Cortese (still living in september 2011), where takes a identity of another woman in a concentration camp in WW2.Director of this film noir is Robert Wise where became famous for directing THE musical "West Side Story" and later in 1979 "Star Trek - The movie".DVD:The picture quality is very good, almost perfect. The DVD contains a english stereo soundtrack and subtitles.Bonus-Features:Audio-Commentary, (sadly not subtitled).Photo Gallery (scenes from the movie, behind the scenes, portraits)Fazit: interesting, thrilling, very camera work (light/shadow), a great art decoration (a old victorian-style indoor Set!).
2177	the strongest man in the world: THIS BOOK WAS ALL I HOPED IT WOULD BE , IT PORTAYS THE RISE TO WORLD CHAMPION OF ONE OF THE GREATEST LIFTERS IN HISTORY. THE BOOK STARTS BY GIVING SOME DETAILS OF ALEXEYEVS CHILDHOOD AND UPBRINGING THEN GOES STRAIGHT INTO HIS EARLY CONTESTS, THE AUTHOR A NOTED LIFTER HIMSELF REALLY SEEMS TO CAPTURE THE AUORA THAT SURROUNDED THE GREAT MAN IN HIS HEYDAY ,AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY OTHER GREAT COMPETETORS ALLWAYS SEEMED TO LIFT BELOW THEIR BEST WHEN UP AGAINST ALEXEYEV. THE BOOK PLOTS HIS CONTESTS UP TO THE TIME OF PUBLICATION AND HAS A VERY GOOD PHOTO SECTION AT THE BACK, ALL IN ALL THE BOOK IS ONE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A WEIGHTLIFTER OR SPORTSMAN , EVEN THE FORWARD BY ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IS INTERESTING READING, A THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE FACTUAL INSIGHT INTO A GREAT ATHLETES LIFE.
2178	Great Western: This is a great western on the scale of L'amour.John Reese was a personal friend while I was growing up and I love his books, they are great for all ages.
2179	Great Headset: I realy like this head set it was a replacement for my Motorola H700the sound quality is very good comparing with many other brandsthe attached accessories is amzingthe weight is very good and you can feel comfortable while wearing itthe battery is not much long but maybe because I'm a heavy user i can use it for arround 4 hours of talking time which I think fair enough for many usersany way as a total feed back I recommend this Headset
2180	love the sound, hate the mess: I got this for my uke, to soften the notes-dislike the loud clacking that plastic picks can make. Sounds nice for single notes, but drags on chords, & leaves itty-bitty bits of shaved rubber sticking to your instrument.
2181	Not what I had hoped: This software seemed to be working great, until I tried to save the program to a disc. It then locked up several times and when I tried to reopen the slideshow, it wouldn't open it, it would just freeze up and not respond. The features to create the slideshow were wonderful, the reshuffle feature made it so easy to drop photos in and then randomize them. I also liked that you could see where in the music each picture would fall. The preview of the show was great, however now I cannot even view that. I spent several hours, loading pictures and music, formating them so they were just perfectly placed and saved the file. Now I have nothing to show for all those hours of work. Somehow the software needs to be improved.
2182	Sara: Diana Kennedy is the best in her field!! She is my cooking guru.This is another of her many excellent cookbooks.Bravo!!
2183	download trailer then you've seen all the good parts: From the trailer you can gather what the story is aboutFrom the trailer you can see all the funniest scenesFrom the trailer you can figure out how it all endsFrom many other reviews you can see this is a movie not worth renting, which was disappointing because I do like both the main actorsThe fact that Hollywoood is AGAIN remaking what is normally a superior movie is a sign you should stay away from the remake and just watch the original. The only exception to this rule this year would be War of the Worlds.
2184	So Easy A Toddler Can Do It?: I have a son, 2 yrs old, and he loves to come & "dance" with Mommy when I put the dvd on. I love these workouts because they're not complicated so when I have to dash off to stop my son from getting into another something I can, and still pick up with the workout easily! And - it's also possible to do this with someone hanging on your leg, the workout modifies for a multitude of reasons. I enjoy it because I can pick the workout I need by time/intensity and so no matter whether I have 15 or 40 minutes to spare I can find one that works for me- and I always feel better for it. Highly recommended.
2185	Confusing, and Disappointing: I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But I didn't feel for any of the characters, I didn't know who they were or where they were coming from. And when you finally figure out what really happened, it's over.In the end I was just left wondering how anyone could truly like this movie.
2186	I wouldnt buy this again: I searched everywhere to find the perfect crib set for my son, I LOVED this set online. The first time I washed this the comforter came apart. It has very poor quality stitching. Since I bought this on Amazon I tried to return it & get a new one. They had just stopped working with Babies R Us & told me I would have to call them to return it. Long story short there was not a Babies R Us closer than 2 hours away so unless I drove to the store to return it I was stuck. I wound up having a friend fix it for me but it was alot of work for her, she had to take the whole thing apart & sew it back together again.
2187	An amazing band: When it comes to this band, Deftones have a diffrent sound in nu metal. Chino has a great voice, and he shows it in this album. Be quiet and drive is one of the best deftones songs ever. Another good song is Head Up with Max Cavalera. Deftones is a band that dosn't care about the mainstream. All they care about is playing music. When you hear My own Summer man that makes you want to get up and just rock out. I don't care too much for nu metal but this band stands out. They made me a fan and when you hear this it'll make a fan out of you. I hear other metal bands to see if they have a cool sound like Deftones. Tool is one of those bands that I like now. Anyway great band and I am proud to have this in my cd collection.
2188	Family loved it!: We are hooked on Uncle Si! The whole family can watch this DVD and actually learn some good faith values. Just goes to show you don't have to live in the big city to make your fortune.
2189	Grim and boring: I had to force myself to get through this thing, and it took several days to do it. Not even Sutherland could save this turkey. If you like this opera (and I don't), then I highly recommend this production. Everyone in it was outstanding. I had this on CD with Callas many years ago and wound up chucking it. I hated it. The tenors and Sutherland each and together have a few good moments, but not enough to make a 2 hour and 20 minute opera out of. The mezzo gypsy did her part well (the relief came during the final curtain call when she smiled and then she looked human and beautiful), but I greatly dislike Verdi's mezzo gypsies, and his operas are littered with them. Blood, guts, burnings at the stake, death, torment, Verdi at his finest. All the gypsy woman did was suffer. I read that Sutherland was 60 when she filmed this, and she could still do it. Only she does it better when she's got something to do it with.
2190	sluggish reaction time: i returned it 2 days later, after i've found out ipod nano and old ipod are more responsive. how come apple allow supposedly new products to be released with less impressive user experience than the one they hope to repalce...
2191	Not Very Good: In my opinion, Nora's first album was her best. Her second one wasn't quite as good as the first one, and the third one wasn't special at all. The third one had too much thought behind it and not enough emotion. Too much mind, not enough "feel."
2192	Meh: I have seen this movie before, maybe it was on broadcast TV. Now I've seen it on blu-ray. The movie is mostly depressing. It takes place in a small southern town. The people who live in this town are either bored or depressed. About the only happy person in this picture is the town hooker. It seems everyone has her telephone number, she makes house calls! Also great at polite small talk. Halle Berrys and Billy Bob Thorton's charactures seems to have more than their fair share of problems. It's also so quiet I had to rewind and turn up the volume to hear some of the dialogue.There are a few scenes you might find disturbing.However the ending was happy. That always works for me
2193	Available for Free: This historic book is available for free from Project Gutenberg http://www.gutenberg.org. Search for Geometry. This book is one of a few books available. This is the complete Open Court text. It is available both as a pdf file and a TeX file.
2194	The one to buy if you've got sensitive skin: Although I'm a couple of years past the half-century mark, my skin is still prone to break outs. That is why I can't use a blade as my primary shaver. I've had the 8894XL since it first came out. It gives a very good shave, but not as close as a blade. But the best thing is there is minimal irritation.Thinking I could get a closer shave with an electric razor, I got the top of the line Braun. It did give me a shave as close as a blade, but at the expense of great irritation and break outs. It made me appreciate the Norelco more.If getting the closest possible shave at all costs is the most important quality you are seeking in an electric razor, get the Braun. However, if you are plagued with irritation when shaving, then this Norelco is the shaver for you. It is for me.Oh, and the razor is easy to clean.
2195	You get seasick from the camera motion!: It could have been a good movie, pretty good plot. But the producer opted for lots of filler - violence instead of good acting and camera action so fast it makes you dizzy from not being able to focus on a scene for more than 1/10 of a second! Watched it to the end, but was disappointed with the lack of real quality. Really hated that most of the movie involved the camera swinging back and forth, up and down and around. It was enough to give one a seizure!
2196	Bought for You and Your Hand, but others are good too: I bought this mostly for "You and Your Hand". However, while that's still a favorite, "Dear Mr. President" is excellent as well as the "Stupid Girls" which is being played on air. There is also a bonus track not listed that is done by Pink and her dad about his Vietnam War experience which is very good. The insert to the cd (the paper thing with the lyrics) is also quite interesting. It has many pictures and her "insights" to the cd, life, etc. I would definitely recommend it, am glad I bought it and I will NOT be putting it on eBay as I do many cds I buy and don't care for!
2197	A Anthony BOURDAIN at his best!: Found this book while perusing books to down load on my kindle. What an excellent read! Interesting, educational, funny, and way better than I thought it would be about becoming a Chef! Now I will have to read all the rest of books he has written! Talented, smart guy; who would have known!
2198	One for the Money: I read the book and enjoy everything this author writes. The casting of the characters couldn't be better. They story line is true to the book. A fun way to spend the evening!
2199	An Amazon purchase: This is difficult simply becaue my wife and I love this show yet we could not, would not watch after the departure of some of the original stars nuff said.Product arrived on time and in great condition, thanks guys.
2200	Gorgeous Book: I liked Jhumpa Lahiri's first book (Interpreter of Maladies) but wasn't a die hard fan. After 'The Namesake', I'll have to read everything she writes.A fair number of writers base their work on the Indian diaspora, and the developmental confusion that results from the clash of two very different cultures. What sets Lahiri apart is her work's universal appeal. I do believe that having a background similar to the book's central character makes it much more absorbing, but any person who has immigrated to this country and struggled with two cultures will find this book engrossing.Even if you discard the immigrant subtext, Lahiri is a masterful storyteller and spins a fabulous yarn. Just for that, this is a book worth reading.
2201	Starts with a bang but well........: One of the reviews on the cover of the book says something like the best first 50 pages ever written...well this statement certainly holds good..the book starts with a bang and you rush through the first 50 pages but then what happens..we are taken through a tour of brazilian wetlands and the book alternates between america and the adventure in the brazilian wetlands :-( to find the missing heir.Skip the portions of the supposedly brazilian adventure and read through the rest of the book...so out of the 500 odd pages the 250 pages are pure grisham stuff thats why 2 stars and the rest a big yawn...hoping that the next book of grisham 'The Brethren' will be a good read.
2202	Copy protected to uselessness: The copyright protection on the cd has prevented it from being used on all but one cd player that I've tested (my girlfriends car). In order to use it on a computer you have to agree to the download of a music player included on the cd (with no documentation) that prevents you from making an MP3 out of it. Nice waste of money.
2203	Secretos de escritores: Allá por los años '60, en medio del agitado ambiente de las revoluciones latinoamericanas, un grupo de escritores de diferentes procedencias, comenzaron a brillar en el "mercado" literario mundial. Estos escritores devenidos en estrellas, no sólo comenzaron a gozar de una creciente popularidad, sino que además estuvieron íntimamente relacionados con las realidades políticas de sus países. La mayoría exiliados, fueron los mentores de la época más comercialmente brillante (y literariamente "maravillosa", pues se trata de la época del realismo mágico) de la literatura latinoamericana. Este libro relata, desde adentro de este grupo, qué era lo que sucedía, cuáles eran sus problemas y expectativas e ilustra la relación entre grandes figuras de la literatura, como García Márquez, Vargas Llosa y Cortázar, entre otros.
2204	Best stocking stuffer ever: We purchased this as a stocking stuffer for our son. He loves the LEGO kits but because we don't get Cartoon Network, he had never seen the show on TV. He watched the DVDs for several days and really enjoyed them.
2205	This is beginning to get boring!: Nothing new to report here, except we have yet another live release[are we up to 50 live cd's now?] of Grateful Dead music that offers nothing new and is only intended for hardcore fans who want to hear "Franklins Tower" or "Good-Lovin" for the 80th time. When Mr. Garcia passed away that was truly the end of the Grateful Dead as an active creative group. What we have now are record companies, who continue to cash in on their library of stored away live grateful Dead music. Compare "Europe 72" to this garbage and you will see what I am talking about! Let the Dead rest in peace and stop these ridiculous Bi-monthly live releases.
2206	Wonderful, But With Too Much Unfinished Business: This is a wonderfully written novel about betrayal, forgiveness, and redemption. It starts out after Anna's father Joseph Schoene has died. She finds out that he has left journals explaining why he did some of the horrific things he did to her and her mother. We are led thru the young family's life in Shanghai, and their separation when Eve (her mother) and Anna return to the states without Joseph.He tells Anna that he wrote his journals so she will understand why he did what he did. I read the book and never understood him, which was a source of tremendous frustration to me. But I did understand Anna's need for her father and the necessity for her to forgive him in order to heal her own sorrows.
2207	Insulting: I thought I'd find some helpful insights in this book. There is nothing new here. This is the same message we've always heard in new packaging. That's not to say the message is wrong (diet, exercise, behavior modification). Unfortunately, this packaging includes McGraw making insulting comments on nearly every page. Comments like getting "your fat behind" to the gym and other remarks are insulting to people who struggle with a not-simple-to-solve problem. Perhaps the author thinks that this is part of his well-known 'folksy' style. I was offended, however. Not recommended.
2208	Harry Potter: The third movie from the Harry Potter series is a movie with dark mysteries that will make your mind travel. I love the Harry Potter series!
2209	Still one of my favorite Irish albums: I found the cassette in a drawer, and instantly remembered how much I enjoyed it. I wasted no time getting the CD. It's as great as I remembered, if you ignore the extra tracks added to the CD. Unfortunately, they only detract from the original brilliance.
2210	high-impact nothing: When closing price goes up N times, buy. When it goes down N times, sell. Exit when profitable enough. If exited too early, re-enter. Use stops. Different markets are profitable in different time frames, from one-minute to hourly bars. This strategy is very profitable and has been tested on one month of data. If this sounds interesting - buy this book.Alternatively, read this review again and implement it in your trading.
2211	Inconsistent and fragile: I actually get fairly good throughput when the units work, about 25 Mbps (and I am running them across circuits). The main issue I have is that throughput regularly drops to less than 400 kbps, and on occasion does not work at all. I initially assumed this was because something in my house was causing interference, but I haven't found anything consistently running when I have issues. I have had sudden connection problems in the middle of the night when I'm the only one awake and I know that nothing was suddenly turned on.Additionally, I had one of my units fail within 6 months. I was able to return them to D-Link, and the return process was actually pretty good, but it doesn't leave me with a lot of confidence in their quality (especially considering there are multiple other posters who have had the same problem).Buy something else!
2212	Actual Music!: Don't get me wrong - I like the techno Underworld stuff on Friday nights when I'm anticipating a party weekend. But the other 90% of the time when I am not in party mode, I prefer something more melodic, and this album fits the bill.I disagree with comparisons to Yaz and Depeche Mode. This album has a little bit more mature funk to it. If I was to compare it to another band, I would say it sounds more like Ministry before they went hard industrial. And, similar to the early Tears for Fears albums, all of the songs are strong enough to make the entire album playable.If you like 80s pop, this album is a must. But if you like the edgier techno of Underworld, you might be disappointed.
2213	Awful!: Truly terrible. The "surprise" isn't concealed very well, so it won't really surprise you. The ending is preposterous. This may be the only performance of Julianne Moore's career that was not excellent; instead it was mediocre. The pacing of the film is really slow, which is saying something for 96 minutes. In short, it's neither "erotic" nor "a thriller."
2214	Starts good, ends "Huh?": Knowing started off good. I got pulled into the numbers-catastrophes thing and the overall atmosphere of the film, created by a muted palette of greens and grays against an autumn setting. Then it went out of control. It felt like the writers didn't know what to do so they just made something up as they went:"What do we do now?""How about some aliens?""Sure. Put that in."Without giving it away, we've been to this movie before. Knowing is a decent 2-star, throwaway flick when you have nothing else to rent.
2215	I was UNIMPRESSED with this book: To be honest, I wish I had not spent my money. Any kitchen cookbook has many of the recipes found in this.From reading it, I would not say that Marina Bear American as many of the ingredients of the "unusual" recipes simply cannot be found in your local store so the book is a waste of money.Perhaps if you lived in Mongolia, it would be of some use.My 2 cents.
2216	El: My little newphew loves, loves trains. At this time this is his favorite train book. We read only every other page. The other pages are to long, but he loves it. And I like the theme of the story.
2217	Hard To Read Dial: This is a handsome watch, but it is very hard to read the LCD displays. The instructions are necessary as there is nothing intuitive about setting the time and accessing all of its functions. The instructions that came with the watch are only readable with a magnifying glass (for those over the age of 39), as they are written in micro type. The watch band pulls hair out of my wrist, so I don't wear it. Overall I'd say this is a stylish watch, but it is a real dog as far as ergonomics are concerned.
2218	Great product! Very happy with it.: Bought the 9" digital frame the other day. So far have been very happy with it. Yes, the lcd screen is only 8" not the 9" that I and some others expected. The picture resolution is very good. Even though it states the resolution on this frame is slightly lower than the 7" model, I don't think it really makes a difference. The menu control buttons on the rear could use some improvement. They are not labeled except for the power button. This has lead me to push the wrong button on occasion. The onscreen menu is very easy to navigate. I was able to set up the frame in just a few minutes with very little input from the manual.
2219	A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT: Hoping to expand my experience with oriental fiction in a story by a Japanese writer I ordered this impressively recommended novel. It was more than novel. It was wierd, with a story line that wasn't believable even pushing the limits in accepting the supernatural. The amateurish development of the "monster" character coupled with detailed episodes of grisley gore and violence might attract Japanese Godzilla fantasy fans. Not me. It didn't end. It just stopped, which turned out to be one of the better elements of the book.
2220	No good for Tinnitus: I use this product for over 2 months at double dose and got zero improvement.It seems for the reviews that it help for Menier disease since it is possible that it can go away by itself.In the case of Tinniitus it is worthless don'r waste your money on this crap...syl
2221	lovely film: There are no words to discribe how lovely this film is, frist off i would like to say thatit was warming and heart felt also very unexpected if u don't know what im talking aboutyou will have to watch it to find out.-movie girl out!
2222	Copy protection hazzard: The album is OK but, the copy protection is terrible. When I place the CD in any drive and try to listen it resets my computer. I also have an expensive Bose portable CD player. It does not recognize this as a CD. So be warned MAY NOT WORK in your player! No help from Sony, RCA or BMG.
2223	hated it: I would give this no stars if I could, it is the second bonsai in a year that came with a fungus. First one was a Christmas present from my husband, I thought I was doing something wrong didn't know that the white cotton spots was a fungus, I thought they were mini spider nest. When the second plant arrived I saw the same white web spots, again thought they were spider nest., as the tree was losing leaves quicker than the first plant, I asked, Heidi, a plant specialist if she had any suggestions as to what I was doing wrong, and when I brought my plant problem to her she told me there was nothing I could do to save the plant and said that is a fungus in between all branches, not spiders. Now I own 2 dead plants do you think the company would replace them with some healthy plants we will see...
2224	Good start....very dull ending: Usually you can tell if a book is going to keep your interest right away but not with this book...this one started out promising but really fizzled by the end. The characters all turned into saints...The plot turned lifetime for women. The joe character was totally not realistic...falling off a cliff.. getting beaten up all the time but not sustaining major injuries...all the gay characters must die for some reason..couldn't they just have had regular lives as most gay people do??/ Wow was this a waste of time....
2225	Way Ahead of their time...: Hands down, one of the top 25 records of the 1990's, although some may disqualify it on account of it being a collection of the band's first 3 or 4 EPs.Curve was definitely a studio band, and the production here lacks a peer. From "Cherry", "Clipped", "Coast Is Clear", to (my favourite on the album) the extended version of "Fait Accompli", there isn't a weak track on it. It sounds more abrasive than anything Skinny Puppy could put out, but at the same time, more lush than a Brian Eno wet dream.Time might have passed Curve by, but a certain band loved them enough to revamp/dilute the formula a few years later to mainstream success (read the other reviews to figure it out); the difference in quality between the two is massive.Shirley Manson, eat your heart out...
2226	Zips do not last: I bought one of these a while ago and the zip that closes the laptop section broke after 9 months. Thinking it was a bit of bad luck, I bought another one, and the zip broke in exactly the same place in less than 6 months. Clearly the zips are not hardy enough. Dont buy this rubbish.
2227	Maybe I got a Lemon!?: Let me begin by saying I dislike negative feedback but in this case it is warranted. I purchased the control for use with Microsoft's flight simulator which I've always enjoyed using in the past and as a licensed pilot I can say it was realistic enough to be useful = particularly in instrument flights.However I cannot us the program because the Logitech Attack 3 Joystick continuously malfunctions. I run the calibration and all seems OK - but when I try to actually use it the control is so far out of calibration that if I ever relax the control or let go of it - the airplane immediately executed a diving roll to the right - goes inverted and crashes.The unit shipped without a CD (not even sure it is supposed to have one) and there was no manual. For me it is a frustration and a complete waste of money - Good luck with your - maybe mine is just a lemon!? I say this as I had one that worked previously - just can't remember the model I had.
2228	Handle Ripped: I liked this bag because it was masculine but the handle started ripping after about 2 months and finally broke after 4 months. We tried to sew it but that was pain. It is a nice bag with good features but be careful with the handles.Oh and the diaper pad being attached is nice idea in theory but when I use it in public restrooms on diaper changers there is not enough room for the bag on the changer. It gets top heavy and falls and could be dangerous with the baby on it. Plus it's a pretty short diaper pad. You're better off with a separate diaper pad. So overall, I would not recommend this exact item.
2229	The Wrong Version: This is a wonderful story and production...originally. However, the BBC Video (company) version I purchased which is 100 minutes in length had been edited so much that there were entire scenes missing right from the begining! I know because I taped the original when it aired on Masterpiece Theatre.Buyer beware: This is not the full length version of the otherwise excellent program.
2230	Yugoslav Logic - An Oxymoron?: Robert Hayden is uniquely qualified to examine the Yugoslav mess - as a legal scholar who is deeply familiar with the families, clans, tribes and nations who made up the first and second Yugoslavias and as an anthropologist who can find his way through the constitutional jungles those peoples created. This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how the Bosnian civil war developed out of competing competing constitutional interpretations.
2231	Not the original...: My husband loved Alf when it was originally on TV. He was excited to receive it on DVD as a Christmas gift. Our kids (ages 10 and 5) love to watch it with him. We have purchased each season as it becomes available. I thought the kids would love the animated Alf just the same. To my disappointment, they do not. They prefer the original. The "Animated Adventures" just doesn't hold their attention. Not to mention that it confuses them because all the characters look similar and Alf goes by a different name.
2232	Someone should tell Ms. Thomas that turkey isn't a vegetable: I own all three of Anna Thomas's cookbooks, and have been a huge fan of her's since the first was published way back in the 70s. However, she really let us down here by including directions for carving a turkey. Although I obviously wouldn't dream of protesting if I encountered that in a "mainstream" cookbook, it has no place in a vegetarian cookbook, and is very offensive to many vegetarians (myself, included).
2233	Doesn't fit my Eddie Bauer car seat!!: This says it fits Eddie Bauer car seats but I have the sinclair travel system and it doesn't fit the car seat. It appears to be of good quality but I am very disappointed to see that it doesn't fit. Even the box says it fits Eddie Bauer car seats (doesn't specify which ones).
2234	They are beautiful: I've wanted these dishes since I first eyed them, but wasn't able to get them right away. Finally got them and they are gorgeous. My only problem is with their bulkiness. My sink (no dishwasher) always looks packed with dishes with just a few in the sink. I'm sure I'll get over it. Much impressed.
2235	Kindle edition riddled with typos: This review is for the Kindle edition of the book and not the book itself (which I very much enjoyed and would have given 4 to 4 1/2 stars). The Kindle/electronic version was obviously scanned into a program and not proofread AT ALL. There were typos on almost every page. Often words ending in 'll (like they'll) would be spelled with the number one instead of a lowercase "L" and I'd was often spelled Fd. There were also sometimes no line breaks where there should have been in dialogue (not starting a new line with a new speaker), hyphenations of words nobody in their right mind would hyphenate, and and replacing l with i (Piainview instead of Plainview.) It was ridiculous. I can't believe nobody read it before putting it up for sale. I noticed the same issues with the Kindle edition of Reflecting the Sky by the same author.
2236	Sell Out....: After ESCM was released, I read a review that hailed BT as the artist most likely to bring trance into mainstream consciousness, so long as he could bridge a gap with pop. Unfortunately, it seems like that's what he attempted here, only he went way too far. These tracks have none of the innovation or passion of his earlier releases. All that's left is a boring, progressive pop album that will play to top-40 audiences much more effectively than his true fans or club listeners. Even the standout track Heaven Scent is a weak version - you can find more uplifting, EnErgizing mixes of it almost anywhere. Here's hoping BT will return to his roots on his next efforts.....
2237	Tough Instalation, No Tech Support: By far, this is the worst product experience I have ever had. After installing in my computer, my SCSI drive could no longer be read. I contacted Adaptec customer support and they refused to help me until I could get an ID number off the card that I could not get until I booted. I pulled out the card to get the ID number and it fried my motherboard.After getting my computer back from repair, I purchased an LSI Logic SCSI adpater. It worked perfectly and automatically reading the drive that could not be read by Adaptec.Be warned -- Adaptec used to be great and is on the decline. It is a ghost of its former self.
2238	Do not fit as stated: Don't waste your time and money. Ads made it seem these were made specifically for my truck model. Not close. Wish they had worked.
2239	Mini Iron Holder: Exactly what I needed! Perfect for pressing those applique curves! Keeps the ot iron from burning things around it.Great speedy shipper! thanks!
2240	Works great: Works great. The size is about the same as your average pizza stone, so no worries about mismatches. Don't forget to sprinkle it with flour or cornmeal though, or your pizza will stick to it.
2241	Run Away!: This printer does produce some fine output. That is when it works. The paper feed constantly refues to load paper. The film scanner should have been left off all together (not worth using). I have been looking everywhere for a recall on this unit (read ALOT of negative reviews). I have been a long time HP fan, but after this experience I am going to look elsewhere. My advice is to NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRINTER!
2242	The Pill (should be tilted: The Fail): I watched this movie, not as good as I pictured. There were some hilarious scene away from the main characters, my favorite Mindy's family and her ex-boyfriend scene. Overall the film would have been much shorter with a condom :)
2243	A stupid book: The only people who should get this book are people who are forced to because their school uses it. It is poorly planned and hard to find topics that you want to review. The worst part about this book is that it has no answers to the exercises in it making it usless for anyone wanting to advance at their own pace or for self studiers or even know if they are on the right track! A waste of money. Get New Penguin Russian Course instead for a fraction of the price it is way better than any of the books that the universities are using.
2244	Bait and switch: The Swarovski company speaks out of both sides of their mouth. The refund and repair policy is nonexistent when needed. Whatever the problem, they seem to have an excuse not to honor their commitment. I wish I had read their reviews on the Complaint Board before buying. Note: I did not buy this item or my item from Amazon. I will never buy from them again.
2245	Pointed repetition: Appreciating that this film is based on a true story and has outstanding cinematography, I stopped taking the plot seriously somewhere in the middle due to the depicted Waodani tribesmens' obsession over both the noun and verb form of the word "spear." After the intense opening scene, the rest of the spearfest got a little old -- almost to the point of satire, where viewers can use a stopwatch to time how many minutes pass in the film before something or someone gets impaled.
2246	Broke after 3 uses - difficult to get fixed: I bought this deep fryer on Amazon and used it 3 times before it broke. The on/off switch just pushed inside the unit. There is no way to get it fixed except to send it back to the manufacturer. It would sure be a lot simpler if you could get it repaired locally, or if they would even send you a box to ship it in. I am going to be stuck with the cost of shipping it to them, not to mention the hassle of dumping the oil, cleaning it out, finding a box to ship it in, and actually getting it boxed up and taken to the post office. I wouldn't recommend buying this product. Buy something that you can get repaired locally if it breaks!
2247	An exceptional book!: I read this book in one evening, I couldn't put it down. I am new at quilting, and found the book very informative. Ms McElroy has a wonderful knack for being with the reader, by using photos in explaining steps such as how to thread your needle, as well as how to make your first and last stitch. In addition, she has clear pictures of what 'not to do', something I realized I 'was doing'! I plan to use her tips in selecting my supplies. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to quilt!
2248	Excellent off-beat look at management and leadership.: A client quoted this book twice in his MBA application essays, and I was compelled to read more than just those snap-shots. I'm glad I did. Each chapter is only a few pages long and they all led me to think in new ways. My favorite of Farson's paradoxes: "Technology always produces the opposite of its intended effect." I've already read it once and am ordering it to read again and pass on to my colleages at work.
2249	This book needs a sequel: Anyone who gives this book to children would no doubt be interested in purchasing a sequel: "Quick, don't think: why do I need critical thinking when adults get through life in willful ignorance?"Misleading children with books like "Genesis for Kids" should be considered a form of child abuse.
2250	It was a great movie with great music and dancing!: This movie was wonderful it was about a man from Cubia who came to the United States to work as a handy-man in a building where pepole did ballroom dancing.The man fell in love with a great dancer. To see more you will just have to buy it from Amazon.com
2251	Witty, charming and churning. Wolf gives us ourselves.: Simply, THE NIGHT IN QUESTION, is filled with quick witted, short stories, that subtly asks and answers the small questions of all our lives. The actions of the characters are filled with a regularity that we all can be empathetic towards, and yet also be surprised in the turn of events that face those characters with the questions of mortality, fear, and solitude. This is an easy read, and yet thought provoking. I would recommend to anyone who truly enjoys short stories.
2252	Love this hard to find CD!: Product was in great shape, and I have been looking for thisCD for quite sometime. Very happy to have it.
2253	Poor And Boring Movie.: It's only merit is that is family friendly. I think. Since I was unable to watch the whole movie, due to overcoming boredom.
2254	Big Train Chai Vanilla No Sugar Added - Yummy: This stuff is great. It is like drinking a snickerdoodle with it's sugar and cinnamon flavor and although it's not calorie free, at least it is No Sugar Added. Great on cold nights!
2255	KR: I love the songs on this disc. However, it is not really compatible with the PS3. So sometimes, one of the two microphones do not work and shut off. When you reboot the PS3, it still doesn't work. So be wary of this.
2256	Santa, this is what I want for Christmas!: I perused this beautiful book and I've never seen photos as breathtaking as these. I'm not easily impressed anymore, but this book had me enthralled. As I'm busily buying gifts for others, I'm asking Santa for one of my very own. This book will take you places you could only dream of before. Great job!
2257	Best Warm Drink Mug: This is a replacement of a previous Nissan mug and the product remains the best mug for hot drinks that's out there.
2258	Quick and dirty: Correct me if I'm wrong, but no FM transmitter will provide the kind of sound quality you get from a gizmo that goes in the casette player. That said, if you want to play your iPod (or anything with a line-level signal and a 1/8" plug) in the car or on a friend's stereo, the TuneCast will do it. But between songs or when you turn the volume up above dinner-music level (unless I'm doing something wrong), you'll hear the hiss and buzz that I got on every frequency I tried, even when I placed the transmitter right up against the FM antenna of the intended receiver.I'm back to the cassette deck gizmo. Thank goodness I didn't throw it away when my portable CD player died.
2259	Good, clean, very fun movie.: Honestly, at first I thought this movie looked a little boring. From the cover, it looked only ok. I then watched this, and loved the small-town scenes and old-time romance between the parents. It was a fun romance too, but it seemed that Cody was much more interested in Faith than she was with him. Whether she was just ignorant, or purposefully not interested, she was extremely dry and unaffectionate. The movie was almost perfect, if only Faith would have been more real and emotionally in touch with what was going on between her and Cody. This movie is suitable for all ages; no swearing, perverse actions, or anything else. I really enjoyed this movie because it was not like the trashy movies being made today.
2260	Awesome Camera - Awful Batteries!: I was ecstatic when I purchased this camera a couple of months ago. But was quickly dissapointed when my battery went dead before I took 8 pictures?!!! I waited to install the software because I was unsure if I wanted to keep a camera that would eat batteries everytime I wanted to use it. But I finally did, and what GREAT QUALITY PICTURES! Now the tricky part is to find a battery / chargable system thats compatible and actually works. So when I go on vacation to Disneyland with my kids, I am not worried about the life of my batteries.Instead I can have the time of my life and get great photos!
2261	Pure jangle-pop confection!: A sparkling collection of songs, all sounding like Top 40 hits that never were but should have been, this is perfect music for a summer afternoon. If your head isn't bopping happily back & forth after a couple of tracks, check your pulse! This is like the best sunshine pop of the late 60s, complete with "la-la-la" choruses, Byrdsy guitars, and a warm wash of psychedelic fizz. The CD not only gives us the complete vinyl album, but several bonus tracks as well, including a terrific cover of "Incense & Peppermints." Joyfully recommended!
2262	Meh.: I bought this in anticipation of the 2011 edition coming out, and it was pretty much a complete dud. The poor pacing, bad jokes, inappropriate substitute host (one of the other writers - he's still working for Jellyvision) and on-the-cheap graphics really killed it for me.
2263	Fantastic!: As a perpetually confused Christian, this book spoke to me.I was searching for a way to come to terms with certain Biblical stories and teachings that didn't make sense to me. Dr. Weatherhead put everything I was feeling into words. And hearing my thoughts stated so matter-of-factly from such an astute and well-respected theologian really helped me to know I was not crazy after all. He was also able to blend modern Spiritualist theory into Christianity (I just knew they didn't have to be mutually exclusive). I highly recommend this book!
2264	Well worth the money: A pleasure to work with. Good ergonomics. Very accurate. Just remember to turn the switch off or reinsert the dongle when you're done. Would I buy it again? You bet!
2265	Awesome TV: We just received our Samsung TV - what a great picture - we're very pleased. Weren't sure what we should expect from an online purchase of this size but it came on time, delivered quality expected. We bought it bundled with the stand that works perfectly and was very easy to setup - everything matches beautifully. Thanks Amazon! Also, the delivery company - Eagle - were on time, helpful, careful and took the time to unpack and setup my TV and answer questions - very very happy with the whole experience!
2266	Gibson's a great Dane !: This is a Hamlet that's easy on the eyes and the mind...if you don't have the time and stamina for Branagh's 4 hour version, and can't get hold of Olivier's exquisite 1948 film, this is the one for you ! Mel Gibson is excellent as Hamlet. He gives him humor and a masculine vigor, and the top-notch supporting cast is superb. I especially like Alan Bates..his lusty, murderous king is fabulous...and mention should be made of Nathaniel Parker's wonderful Laertes. David Watkin's cinematography is stunning, Ennio Morricone's score subtle and beautiful, and the production one of Zeffirelli's best. This is very enjoyable Shakespeare, even for those who normally don't like him, and I highly recommend this to parents who would like to introduce their teenagers to the Bard. Don't miss this glorious movie !
2267	Very Good for a sequel.: Though I would have l liked to have seen more of Sir Percy and at least an appearance by Chauvlin it was still a great novel worthy of 5 stars!!!!!
2268	Don't buy this! bad bad new recipe!!!: Lindt changed the recipe and it's completely blend, sweeter and leaves a greasy texture in your mouth when it melts. What are these people thinking? That their customers are dumb or what??? I'm so disappointed. This new chocolate sucks and I feel cheated.
2269	HERE WE GO AGAIN!!!: I FEEL THAT WE WERE CHEATED.THE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM RUBEN. RUBEN HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE....WHAT WAS HE THINKING WHEN HE PUT THIS CD TOGETHER? SUCH A BEAUTIFUL..WHAT A WASTE.IF THIS IS HIS BEST I WISH I HAD VOTED FOR SOMEONE ELSE. FOR ALL OF YOU WHO KEEP CALLING US RUBEN HATERS BECAUSE WE DONT LIKE THIS CD ...GROW UP! STOP MAKING EXCUSES..ITS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT THIS CD IS LACKING THE BEST OF RUBEN.. I KNOW RUBEN CAN DO BETTER ..DO YOU? IF YOU'RE WILLING TO EXCEPT THIS AS IS THEN YOU DON'T DESERVE BETTER. I WILL NOT BUY HIS NEXT CD UNLESS HE BRINGS US A CD THAT EQUALS WHAT I HEARD HIM DO ON AMER.IDOL. SO BE IT. A RUBEN HATER? NO. ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION? IF RUBEN SANG THESE SONGS ON AMER. IDOL WOULD HE WIN?
2270	Crossed off my list!: I *finally* laid my hands on a sample vial of SMS after resisting a blind buy for the last few months. Boy am I glad I resisted. This floral is definitely not for me.On me, the opening is very synthetic. At first, the aldehydes reek havoc, then the jasmine gets cloying. A fruit-floral-woods progression is absent. I faintly smell a powdery wonderfulness and occasionally get visions of dancing daffodils, but it's not enough for me to give SMS another chance, even if it smells great on paper.I just don't have the chemistry required for Sophia Grojsman's blends (the perfume's designer). If you're like that too, you might just save yourself some trouble and cross SMS off your test list.
2271	Music from within: I heard this cd from a broadcast at Radio Universidad (University of Puerto Rico- Río Piedras Campus)it resembles me all the anguish, the freedom, the joys and sorrows of human beings. These title talk about the struggle of the people of Samarkand, a land not really known at this corner, a land of mystery. Matlubeh performs a haunting, ethereal and evocative tone in every song that touches the hart, although we don't understand the language, the charming wave fixes on our minds the meaning of words without its knowledge, its music for the unconscious mind, the one that really talks. I know you can find here a space for meditation,and rejoice a sanctuary with no boundaries at all. I highly recomend these shortcut to the within.
2272	defective: bought one, worked 2 days then wouldn't perk, brown residue in pronged hole where you attach cord. returned for replacement. second one leaked coffee from the same hole. (don't know how it get's there, but it's true.) returned for refund. too few things are made with pride today.
2273	Disappointment: Rosamunde Pilcher wrote a wonderful story called WINTER SOLSTICE. This bleak film bears no resemblance to her story and should not be advetised as such. I was vastly disappointed!!!
2274	1 star as it is a required field only.....: It is a shame but i bought this book (in a real store - so sadly it cost more)and none of the math adds up - i have recently discovered that Mr Cook has many lawsuits pending - i do not recommend this book and would question Amazons ability to sell it.
2275	Great item: This is the best warming tray I have ever owned! It takes a few minutes to heat up then unplugged the heat lasts for a good hour....could not ask for more. Very nice quality, good size and good looking too! I highly recommend this warming tray.
2276	Another Leaky Review: The top plastic stopper is two pieces of plastic glued together which is apparently prone to leakage. This thermos leaks like crazy when you try to pour. This began immediately.
2277	Could Have: This was a very good band who very well could have been great if not for poor/arrogant management and their own life style. If you want some hard rock with a different slant you might want to give this one a try. This band defined punk in the late 70's. In my opinion the greatest punk band of all.
2278	Amazon should be ashamed of selling this: CIVILIZATION OF RENAISSANCE IN ITALYAMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF SELLING THIS BOOK....IT APPEARS AS THOUGH IT WAS PRINTED ON DEMAND. MANY SPELLING ERRORS AS WELL AS TERRIBLE PAPER QUALITY. NO BIBLIOGRAPHY, TYPOS ON EVERY PAGE. HORRID PRINTINGIT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SCHOLARLY BOOK, THERE IS NO INTRODUCTION NO PREFACE AND NO QUALITYWE WILL AVOID THIS KIND OF BOOKS IN THE FUTURE..... WE BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE IS ENGAGING IN POOR REPRINTING....
2279	I'm upset: When I bought the DVD I thought I was going to see some of the desirable fantasies a man can have. And there are.But after watching it I deduced this movie was made for women instead of men, the fantasies seem made more for lesbians, the movie it's only 50 minutes long and the fantasies are too long. I think there are too many fantasies.I was dosappointed with the appear of Carmen Electra, every time she appears in a movie she looks like an innocent-shy-teen girl. And of course the song and the video are bad.Definitively, this isn't the best movie of Playboy.
2280	So THAT'S what happened to the dinosaurs...: What can you say about a movie that features dinosaurs on a string, 1000 empty boxes and Z'Dar's chin? Only that Ed Wood would have been proud! Note: The star rating is this high only because I saw it on MST3K. Don't think I could have finished watching this flick without Mike, Crow and Servo.
2281	Limited information, poorly presented: I bought this reference because I liked Stanek's book "Windows XP Professional Administrator's Pocket Consultant." I was disappointed. It is 275 pages, but the information could be printed in half that if weren't all double-spaced and in large type. It is also cheaply printed--the titles seem to use a drop shadow effect that might have looked good on-screen, but looks more like a bug when printed.Only basic command-prompt stuff is presented. I don't see anything about file name completion, for example, and newer tools like fc (File Compare) are not included.There are six pages on scheduling tasks with the "at" command, but it never mentions the newer XP command, schtasks, which is better integrated with the GUI version.Finally, there is no index in the book. There is a chapter that has commands sorted by function rather than name, but it isn't a substitute for a real index.
2282	1st Course in Abstract: Fraleigh does a great job writing a book that is generally easy to follow.There is a big difference between the 6th and 7th edition, notably the change of sections and chapters. This has caused some issue for me considering my professor chose the 7th edition.One could comment that there are not enough examples for many of the theorems or corollaries but I believe a strong part of this book assumes that some of the conclusions YOU the reader need to come to on your own, i.e. by doing some of the problems.
2283	Great Product!: I received this for a gift. I LOVE it! It's simple to use and works great with Folger's Pods or regular coffee. I was actually considering a Flavia machine, but this makes great coffee and great tea. Highly recommended.
2284	Why?: Just another stupid comedy in which Will Ferrel portrays another mind numbing actor with witty comedic lines and even worse scenes.
2285	Of course this is the not musical: The Chicago musical movie came out in 2003 and this tape released in 1991.I guess some other reviewers may have overlooked this fact. Just for the record.
2286	ew: before this album came out, i was siked and looking forward to it. once i bought the album, i was extremely disappointed. our lady peace WAS my absolute favorite band. one of the reasons was because they didn't sound like anyone else. i own every single album that they came out with. they were brilliant when they had lead guitarist, mike. as soon as he quit the band and they gained the "new guy", our lady peace sounds like everyone else. it [is bad]. if you admire our lady peace's old stuff for what it is worth, you will not buy this album.
2287	Jaws 2 is the only good sequel: Jaws 2 is the only good sequel, although I suppose Jaws 3 was good in the theatre with the 3-D effects, and Jaws: The Revenge was just plain dumb. I only wish Steven Speilberg and Richard Dreyfuss had been able to praticipate, then it would have been even better!
2288	ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS: I listened to my friend's copy. I'm buying a copy of my own. This is one CD you just have to own. When listening to Sarah and Jose's songs, spirits soar, almost brought me to tears. You have to listen and experience the ultimate!!! My new all time favorite CD and this one will probably stay up there for a long time if not for ever!!
2289	Best "toy" he got for Christmas: My son got this for Christmas and immediately hooked it up to his laptop. He (and my husband) spent a lot of time exploring the features of this microscope and magnifying many items in our house under the lens. The slides that come with it are fun and educational. He especially loves the fact that he can capture the images and save them on his computer. He's even emailed the images to his grandparents. It's a great microscope and the focusing and functionality are perfect. We'll be "playing" with this for a long time.
2290	Good, but Often Overshawdowed or Overlooked: A bit more violent than I appreciate, but worthy of a viewing or two. Cate owns it, but the others also do well. This film is far, far, better than Shakespeare in Love, which is a vulgar, tasteless, obsurdity. Cate should have won the Oscar, no question. No offense to Gwenyth. At least Elizabeth did well in the nominations department.
2291	Not the Original Recordings!: The CD clearly states that these are the original recordings, but they're not! They're actually re-recordings, and it doesn't even sound like Bobby Hatfield is even singing. It should be called "Unchained Medley" because it seems like it's just Bill Medley singing. These songs are still good, but they are not the timeless original recordings. I'm glad I got this as a gift, because I wouldn't have wanted to waste my money on this.
2292	beauty: yes yes...amazing...best ever..great metal....blasted this in a mall parking lot in front of a bunch of freaks, with their black hair, clothes, and mutilation scars..yes yes...i felt IMMORTAL!!!! this music is top notch death metal...buy it or may you forever hold you peace, or go buy slipknot, you worthless maggot!!!
2293	No no no: What is this? Beatles on peyote? Those who speak of lush beauty aren't completely bonkers -- there are lots of layers here, there's just nothing substantial under all that flaky pastry. At times the music is lovely. Mostly, it's just silly. Imagine this CD as the soundtrack to an HB cartoon and you'll get the idea. Puff'n'stuff indeed. Listening to this, it's clear XTC isn't without talent or vision. Perhaps what they needed was a sober producer.
2294	Disjointed: Are there a few cute boys in this movie? Yes. Does that make it worth it? No. Stupid acting and a script, if you can call it that, which left me dumbfounded as to what the movie was about. In the end, more crass than corny. Not worth it.
2295	An incredible story: Truly incredible. Makes Into Thin Air look like a walk in the park. The privations that these men suffer make this book almost excruciating to read. One of the best books that I read in 1998.
2296	Wont work for 5000 or higher.: received the keyboard, looks good but will not work with the aspire 5000 series or higher it has the wrong pigtail. the description is false. now im out 35 bucks and i have a pissed doff customer who has to wait another 3-4 days.. thanks. 1 star due to shabby listings.
2297	Many hits besides "Jazzman": Another album I had on vinyl in my younger days that I'm replacing on CD. So many great tunes. "Nightingale" "You go your way", "You're something new" etc. This album used to make me smile, I think it will again.
2298	Poorly written book: I had to start to reread this book before i remembered why i had put it down years ago. Poorly written, and full of mistakes, if the author can't get the simple facts right one really has to question the rest of the book. 1 star only because it won't let me show 0. Save your money
2299	Last Suppers: Although not quite up to some of her better works, I found this to be entertaining, as is always the case with Davidson's books.
2300	No magic bullet when comes to removing old caulking: I just tried it yesterday. A sharp knife and a putty knife will do the job. Don't expect to pull the chaulk by applying this product.
2301	One of my FAVORITE series: It is rockin' that they are now doing this series in ebooks! To boot, this book is FREE on 1/27/13?!?! Not something I'd pass up!!!The Sisters are one of my favorite authors and this series, with its lovable main character, engrossing storylines and spectacular writing, is the reason why! Just good readin'!
2302	Great Garrett Brown Interview: Bought this DVD mostly for one particular Extra, the interview with Garrett Brown, the inventor of the Steadicam camera system. He shows you what the Steadicam is and then he explains how they used it in the "movie within a movie". I probably will watch the actual film at some time later.
2303	A great find for planning your wedding!: This book has the amazing ability to cover absolutely every thing you need to think of when planning a wedding and also walks you through the step by step process to making it a huge success. Other wedding planning books were a bit too "on the surface" giving me pointers that I had heard before or weren't realistic. The tips within this book, whether you are a bride on a budget, or have limitless funds, will show you how to add the special elements that make it your wedding. Joyce has managed to create a planning timeline that is realistic, not overwhelming, shows you how to be incredibly creative (even if at times you be creatively challenged) and makes planning your wedding an enjoyable process.
2304	Still ended up buying store test: Took preg test two days before I was supposed to start and got a negative so I thought I was about to start my period. Didn't start so I took anothe rone the next day and got an incredibly faint line, I mean I thought I was seeing things so the next day I went and bought an EPT and it came back with a very DARK POSITIVE! Won't buy these again. Never got to use the Ovulation sticks but I assume they are the same.
2305	not played with: In 3 years of having this puppy it has never been played with. I have tried to get them to play with it, but no.Waste of money!!!
2306	Too Simplistic: The writing style of this book was geared to a 13 or 14 year old girl. I stuck with it hoping things would evolve. They never did.
2307	thick, shallow, biased, wrong title, junk book: Thick book, shallow knowledge on WWII, highly pro-american biased. A most wrong title: D-Day was not THE climatic battle ( Stalingrad: the most long, bloody, a decisive turning point). Junk book, definitely. I still don't understand how I was fooled into buying it, I should ask Mr. Ambrose for a refund.
2308	Too Much Gimmick, Not Much Substance: The theory of this book is that you can get through 1 chapter (concept) in one hour, then you take a quiz when your hour's up to make sure you got the concepts.The quizes are poorly worded. Any question that an "all-of-the-above" option, was ALWAYS "all-of-the-above". Worse than that is that the answers were in the back of the book with NO EXPLAINATION. Please at least tell me why "b" was the correct answer.I think the book brushed over some of the essential accounting concepts, while focusing on less important topics.I wish I would have never written in this book, but I guess I'm stuck with it now...
2309	Poor copies NOT originals: I was so looking forward to getting this CD, but when it arrived, it quickly became eveident that I had allowed myself to be suckered. Despite being billed as various artists (therefore one would rightly assume the originals) this is a cheap copy featuring 'the Hit Crew'. Suffice to say, I doubt this crew has ever had a hit and never will. IMO: The copies contained on this CD are lame, compared to the originals. DON'T BUY!!
2310	A tear jerker, a learning experience and a message of hope.: Recommended for special education students along with LEAN ON ME and DANGEROUS MINDS and RADIO and others, Music of the Heart has a message that should be in demand in this nation seeking sense out of abuse and meyham and so on.It is a message that a citizen can make a difference in a whole school system in a whole community for the good of education. This, inspite of the school systems own battles to end the program. And, the budget for the program was not traditional... it was affordable.The price is right and so is the message... Buy one and give it to your local school.
2311	TKO in the first round: I bought this rotary hammer for drilling in grout holes for rebar and anchor bolts and some other misc. holes in concrete. It is a very good tool for someone who has a lot of varied tasks but dosen't work the tool everyday. The clutch is a wrist saver, the bits are harder to find than SDS Max and the price is right. But the tool went down in a matter of hours, and given Hitachi's impossible to locate parts, I'm shopping for a SDS Max Hilti or Bosch. No tool is a good deal if it shuts your job down.
2312	Worst Video I've Ever Seen: This video is terrible. It looks like it was created back in the 1960s by the hairstyles of the actors, cars in the videos, and the overall quality of the video. I would NOT recommend this video for a child. I purchased this video because of the reviews I've read but now realized I was duped. Most likely the vendor probably wrote good reviews to get rid of the item since I can't imagine anyone liking this video. **** Buyer beware: I've been trying to contact happyhourcollectibles (the vendor who sold me the video) but they've failed to reply to my emails for a request to return the video. Do not purchase from this vendor!
2313	A cheap very poor quality camera: I would not recommend this "camera" to anyone. The quality of the pictures is so grainy and difficult to view. Also the software has very few functions.... I would recommend you spend the extra money and go for one with quality pictures.
2314	Huh?: Bad dialog, bad plot, bad ending, not one single likeable character. Please help me out, as I may have missed something, but didn't both these girls have cell phones all day while working at the clinic? What happened to the cell phones when they went back that same night? While being chased the girls find a phone on a wall but all the phone lines have been cut so they can't call the police. Right after that, the bad guy tells a lab tech that he can't use the phones because the lines are turned off, but the tech says that is no problem because he has his cell phone with him. The girls hear this whole conversation and don't even think to use their own cell phones? Maybe I completely missed the part where the girls purposely left their cells in the car, or lost them, but I'm not going back to look that up for fear my eyes would burst into flames if I opened that book again
2315	a Bust: We would not recommend this coffee maker. We purchased it in April of 2011. I worked OK until March of 2012 and then it ceased to function. We could find no way to check the wiring or find any fuses. When plugged in the clock kept time but the on switch did not work. We have now replaced it with a different brand.
2316	SAVIOR OF ROCK: i first heard andrew wk a few months ago through a friend and within a few days i was hooked, he is absolutlty amazing, every song on this cd is amazing and will keep your energy up 200 percent with their amazing wall of sound for the length of it. my personal favorites are "get ready to die" and "she is beautiful". and after you buy this cd and know every song everyone should try to see him in concert, he puts on an amazing show and if extremely friendly to the fans after the show. 5 STARS. this music is pulling us out of the musical slump we are in and have been in for quite a while. i recommend it 100 percent, it will stay in your cd player for weeks.
2317	TINY: WAAAAAAAAAY Too small im 14 yrs old i ordered a small and after wearing thm for 5 minutes the annoyance of them was so great i just used bear hands on my heavybag. Also after wearing them for 5 minutes they started to rip soooo... dont buy them just get cotton hand wraps or an XXXL. only redeeming quality is they protect really well.Everlast Hand Wraps
2318	Avoid: The sound of your voice is completely unacceptable. It sounds like you are talking from a bathtub. Avoid.
2319	Fits in the palm of your hand! LITTLE: THIS IS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, THEY ARE SO LITTLE ITS NOT FUNNY!SORRY ITS ON THE WAY BACK TO AMAZON.COM
2320	ADDICTING, FUN, AND POWERFUL: I have bought other work out tapes before but nothing like this. This is amazing!!! Not only do you get an excellent workout but you also feel more powerful, able to take care of yourself in any situation. You have to try it. What do you have to lose... except inches. Try it once and you wont want to stop. I've been doing it for 3 weeks now and have seen results in problem areas that no other work out tape has been able to give me! You'll love it!
2321	Doesn't hold a charge... not worth it: I had a solar lantern for years and would hold a charge and light for at least 1-2 hours after dark. These do not work well at all, hold a charge barely at all, so I don't recommend them. As well, there were parts missing.
2322	NOT WHAT YOU WANT: AVATAR is a movie for blu-ray; but this poor edition is not worth the cost. The image is good; but the DVD (included) in not so bad. The only reason to buy this is the 3 extra bucks you are paying for the blu-ray but this edition is worthless
2323	Not really tape...: This "magnet tape" doesn't hold anything that weighs more than a plain piece of copy paper...if that! The magnetic part works great - it's the "tape" that doesn't stick. I bought this at the same time I bought the tape byXyron 3/4-inch Wide Magnet Tape, 25-feet. Works MUCH better!
2324	Clear, readable, and well targeted.: The main strength of this book is Balter's ability to explain both the specific technical details of Access as well as the more philosophical principles that underlie the design decisions you have to make when you build a database. It's a very long book, which is often a sign of poorly chosen or organized information, but she does a good job both of selecting what to talk about, and presenting it clearly. Although I wouldn't say I couldn't put it down (as another reviewer here did) I do agree that it's a very well written book that is about as easy to read as any technical book dealing with a complex subject. To put it another way, if all tech books were written this well, my life would be a lot easier.
2325	Full TIlt: For Stephanie Plum fans, this book will be disappointing. Evanovich had not hit on her literary style when she wrote this story, which is an unrealistic romance with none of the excitement or pizzaz we love. A quick read with little substance.
2326	Waste of time and money: The only reason this album is worth buying is because the entire first cd is really good, and every song you can listen to. The second cd is complete crap and is one of those deals to where it just sits in the shelf and you really never listen to it again. The only songs on there I would actually listen to are Bout It Bout It, and the Hell Rell Freestyles but thats it. So you're better off just borrowing cd 1 from a friend then buying this
2327	Classic: It's dicaprio and winslet. What else needs to be said. Those two can do anything. When there together its gold.
2328	Great Self Improvement Book: The goal of Dr. Morgan is for readers to be able to unlock the potential they possess. He offers insights on how to do so as he teaches the principles practiced by achievers. From a Christian perspective, he teaches one how to live life to the fullest.There are 49 chapters so the reading can be broken down into manageable segments. These ideas were practiced by Dr. Morgan, who was dean of liberal arts at the University of Louisiana in Monroe. He was also a popular speaker for various civic and religious organizations.Although he is a scholar, Dr. Morgan had the ability to communicate effectively with audiences from virtually any background. This book is written to be understood by the general public. It is very easy to follow. I highly recommend it. The examples he uses demonstrate how the principles have worked in the lives of other people.
2329	Only Bratz are Bratz!!!: This doll is so cool!!! I love her outfit, and hair!!! I loved Katia in the 2006 Bratz movie "Genie Magic" The only problem was she looks too much like Jade
2330	OKAY MOVIE. NOW THEY JUST HAVE TO DO THE HONEYMOONERS: IT WAS A OKAY MOVIE WITH SOME FUNNY MOMENTS. THE PROBLEM WAS THE MOVIE BORE LITTLE RESEMBALNCE TO THE HONEYMOONERS. THE 50'S SITCOM WAS MORE LIKE A ONE ACT PLAY WHERE YOU NEVER LEFT THE KRAMDEN'S CRAMP BROOKYLN APARTMENT. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS CHANGE THE NAMES OF THEIR NAMES. MAKE RALPH A CAB DRIVER AND YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT MOVIE.
2331	Not very good: I was not pleased at all wit this product. It's not very stable. The blade piece constantly falls off. It's not a very good quality product to me at all.
2332	Definite Fave: I would have to say that I really enjoyed this cd. It was a close call between this and In Stereo but because I had a major crisis in my life and this was what I had listened to during such, it made me more angry - in a good way.I highly recommend this cd is you like your music catchy and angry.
2333	The Daniel Craig Bond is something new.: It's hard to talk about the Daniel Craig Bond, and particularly this movie, without using the word "gritty." So, there you go. Last summer, I read all the Bond novels in order. Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is more like the Ian Fleming vision than any of the previous actors', including, even, Sean Connery. This is easily the most sober of the Bond films. Lots of exciting action, only over-the-top in the same way as are the action scenes, in say, the Bourne movies. (And the fight scenes seem clearly to owe much to the Bourne films.)That said, to be successful, Craig is going to have to tweak it a bit. We can enjoy a more serious and realistic Bond, as an offset to the serial nonsense which are the Roger Moore films. But he can't be a total downer indefinitely. We're going to want to like the guy at some point and we're going to need at least a little of that Bond humor.
2334	Party thats makes family fun happen: We bought this for our grandchildren and when they wanted me to play the game with them I was simply hooked.... The games are so fun and even though I thought it was just for kids I found myself wanting to play it as much as the kids...If you want family time this is the game for you! The only thing we found was that some games only allows one or two players so we just shared remotes. We highly suggest this game if your looking for family time and excitment at the same time...
2335	Knight of the Peeper has it all!: What else do you need to know other than the super sexy Sativa Verte in her first horror role sheds all of her clothes and meets her demise in this more than competant sexploitation gem.
2336	George Clooney: George Clooney is the worst actor ever. I also believe he is the most unintelligent actor ever. The movie itself is terrible, and George Clooney gives a typically terrible performance. Why waste your time with this trash when you could go to the nearest dumpster and find something infinitely more appetizing. I think George Clooney should be in a western...no thought, no emotion, just a surgeon's hands and a shiny gun, John Wayne did it, he could too.
2337	Wrong bulb: This is NOT a replacement for BL-FS300B. The bulb size is too small, the plug is on the wrong side of the bracket and the plug doesn't match the old style. I had to return it.
2338	A completely useless piece of junk: This scanner is OLD. The technology is old, the support from HP is dreadful. The scanner has constant problems of not being recognized by my computer, not working correctly with the document feeder, and the HP software is SO badly designed. For just a few more bucks, you can actually buy a new scanner that would work.For ADF, look at the newer, cheaper, all-in-one devices. Separate scanners with ADF are just not being made except for very high end work.This scanner doesn't even have scan-to-PDF; instead it uses tiff imaging, creating HUGE files. The provided viewer software works, but the print option in it doesn't - you'll just get a black sheet of paper printed. You have to go to another (non-HP) program to print your scans. And multi-page tiff is a bear to work with.Any scanner now will have multi-page PDF support; that is ESSENTIAL if you are archiving documents. Don't settle for anything less.
2339	Did not recieve product as advertised: The advertised picture shows clearly that the product comes in a box that I used to store my dvd's. When I received the product it was tightly wrapped in plastic NOT IN THE BOX CLEARLY AS ADVERTISED, and many of the individual jewel cases were cracked and broken apart because of the tightness of the packaging. I spent the extra money to get the box that was advertised that the jewel cases came in. I'll think twice about ordering anything from your company again.
2340	there's little rockin' about 'country strong'......: 'country strong' has a lot jammed into its 2+ hour length, yet it doesn't really answer any of the "who, what, when, or whys".....as a result, you have a leading character (gwyneth paltrow) with a tumultous life, yet there's little reason to have any sympathy for her. there's another character--the husband/manager--who we're supposed to accept as the "villain" of sorts (tim mcgraw)--but instead you might actually feel sympathetic toward HIM after watching what he has to put up with. some people have talked about the "suprise" ending, which honestly came as no suprise to me (ask my wife, i called it about 40 minutes in, lol). there's so little to know about these characters, i just couldn't have imagined it ending any other way....it was just as simple as playing "connect the dots". if you're one of those types who HAVE to see this movie, reviews be damned, then at least watch it on cable & not spend your cash on a DVD...
2341	If you like neoclassical metal, this is for you: amazing, i discovered artension just by browsing the internet and im not disappointed by this, the first album of theirs i bought.I found it hard to find this album but it was worth the wait. Songs like Your Victory and The Emporer are just outstanding. the main riffing in this album is from the keyboards but theres some heavy guitar playing too. This is MUCH better than Symphony X in my opinion. Get this album!!!!!
2342	Too Big for Small Dogs: I ordered this bowl for my 6.5 pound Yorkie and the bowl is bigger than it looks.The small size bowl is perfect for a medium sized dog.
2343	Yet Another Liberal View: I have always enjoyed Frontline video series. I thought their piece on the Gulf War was one of the best I've ever seen. However, this series was so slanted towards the left that it left me utterly disgusted. They only interview scholars from notoriously liberal divinity schools who give a completely tainted few of the truth! I suppose this makes for good television and avoids the more controversial black and white issues of the Christian faith (i.e. The one true way to God), but I call it blasphemy.
2344	Be warned, Bad Transfer: This has no information on whether it is the restored version or not. It looks suspiciously like the dire UK region 2 version, in which case it should be avoided like the plague.
2345	For the young reader.: TH and B has limited value as a history. It is very light reading and more suited to the young reader.
2346	Sig P250 "fits" but not really good. (Tight!!): While my Sig P250 "fits" it's too tight IMHO. I'll be cutting off the rivets, putting in some stainless screws and washer spacers.Also, I don't care for the plastic casting nub that is exposed on the inside that I feel is too close to rubbing on the side of my gun on every draw.I'm NOT very impressed.
2347	audio noise: my review keeps getting deleted.this arrived with a lot of audio noise when dvi connecteddifficulty getting it returned
2348	Great for learning to sit up: I was a little worried about the warnings that this contained small parts, but I think that must just refer to the plastic packaging that it came in and there's nothing I can see that a baby could swallow. I got it for my 5 month-old son who is learning to sit up - it helps him to balance and keep himself upright. He seems to really like it, both as a tool and as something fun to touch and look at. It's soft, so if he falls onto it he won't get hurt.I also wanted it for the sounds it makes, but that's kind of a disappointment. You have to press kind of hard to get the sounds to play, and the song that goes with each animal is pretty awful. However, when I press it my son does seem to like the sounds. Overall I would recommend it because it's a great help for learning to sit.
2349	Enjoyed: I read this book some years ago and I needed some lite fiction to read and decided to re-read. I believe I appreciate it more as an older woman. I highly recommend. It's a quick and easy read.
2350	Sisqo's cd is too hot: Hey all the guys if u want some music that helps u out with the ladies or if u want to unwind and just chill then this is the cd for u, all i got to say is that this cd is too hot, plus dont forget that this cd comes with a remix of "got to get it" so pick it up 2day
2351	An excellent all-around book: As a new fan to baseball, I found this book immensely helpful in understanding the subtleties of the game.Before I started watching baseball, I thought that it was boring because it seemed so simple. Once I started paying attention, I discovered that this game is anything but simple - in fact, it is very complex and there are rules to cover almost every situation.Bakalar discusses the rules, the players, the strategies, and even has a section on the managers, omners, coaches and umpires. He has a chapter at the end on how to talk like true baseball fan. I found this book very helpful in understanding baseball. I think that even a long-time fan would enjoy reading this book. It would also make an excellent gift for a baseball fan (though not for very young fans, as it is too complicated for a younger reader.)
2352	My sharpest lens!: This 105mm f/2.8 lens is the sharpest in my arsenal. I took an absolutely amazing closeup of water droplets with my N8008s on a strand of wild grass where the droplets acted like a convex lens. You could actually see the inverted image in the small droplets.I've now made the transition to a D70 and the lens works great there too. With the 1.5X magnification for the APS size sensor, it extends the working distance and gives greater than 1:1 magnification. The images still look great at 6.1 megapixels.Highly recommended!
2353	Excellent "scary" story!: I used this in my school class and they loved it! We listened to the story first and got all giggly; they did talk back to the CD as it became scarier and he kept asking if they were to scared. But it was all good fun and they couldn't wait until the end. Then we had to read it again with the CD and the book. This is an excellent story to start discussing strangers, people are not as they appear, sneaking around and spying on others, danger and many other related subjects. Carl Reiner did a good job!
2354	Where did my Velvet Teddy Bear go??: I loved you on AI! Where did that soulful voice disappear too?? I like a few of the songs, but the rest have got to go! I still love you Ruben! I am happy for the success of Ruben & Clay! Next time Ruben, bring the church down!
2355	Pretty disappointed: I wish I would have read the couple of reviews here. In struggling with the cheap zipper the day received, the metal part of the zipper broke. I got two of these for my two children. They don't say Daisy on them, not a big deal but Daisy should be ashamed to put their name on such a cheap item. I wasn't expecting anything fancy for the price but thought being Daisy brand it would be better than it is. Decided not to return them and just put some velcro on the end so the gun won't fall out when being carried. The kids would have probably been too lazy to zip it all the time anyway. Wish it had a shoulder strap, may add one later.
2356	Great clock for the money: This clock was a great deal for the money. The directions are clear and it's easy to set the times and alarms. The numbers are big and can be seen easily across a room. My only dislike is that the snooze time is too short but other than that, I love this clock.
2357	sux: A kid you cant write three reviews!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this book is terrible. duznt work on my kindle. you cant even read well on this nasty crap. far worse than sam harris's and anaka harris's Lying. dont buy its ridiculous. unfun.
2358	Committed is a Veritable Shergulapalooza: This brilliant take on fantasy football is a must-read for FFL addicts and a should-read for anyone who isn't. Any FFL participant will be able to relate to the characters in this funny, fast-paced book, especially St. Amant's arch-enemy, Shergul, whose legend and ego are surely to grow beyond Kato proportions.
2359	Beware 3rd Party Sellers: This book was advertised as new, still in the wrapper. The book was not new. There were penciled-in remarks throughout the book. Several pages were starting to come out of the book. The wrapper was obviously applied by the owner of the book.
2360	Horrible: Please, return to NO DOUBT to get your mojo back!This album is only suited for football halftime shows.Does she SING anymore?And "Orange County Girl" sounds like a bad Brooke Hogan imitation.The song lyrics say it all:.....Don't know what I'm doin' back in the studio.....Gettin' greedy 'cause he said he had another sick flow.....So I had to hold my back, guess I didn't get enoughShe called this one in.* * * U P D A T E * * *Over the months the album really grew on me, I like about 4 ofthe songs, and the others I can respect for being experimental.Can't wait until the new ND record comes out.
2361	Ummm, Maybe Another Brand: I drink barley grass for its supposed benefits and for the benefits of juicing in general. I recently ran out and purchased this brand because it was fairly cheap. My verdict: too grainy and it left a barley grass 'sludge' at the bottom of the glass that was very difficult to finish! Not dissing barley grass at all...but I'm honestly not fond of this brand.
2362	Simple solution for RV: Easy to install, peel and stick. Inexpensive solution for our RV.Been installed for over a year now, no problem.As always shipping with Amazon Prime was super fast.
2363	almost incomprehensible: the cd that comes with the book is absolutely god awful at giving one an idea of what the polyrythms are to sound like, played on different sound sources and sometimes on other instruments, it sucks! if you know how to sight read very well get it, if not your screwed and save your money
2364	Much better than a feather duster: Whereas a standard feather duster (or even a wet rag) can kick up lots of dust into the air, this thing just sucks it up gone completely. I've run it over delicate electronics, picture frames, keyboards, tv screens, monitors, and bookshelves. It seems to effortlessly clean dust off everything without disrupting its placement or surface whatsoever. Minus one star for the high price.
2365	I will always keep this book.: I think this book tells everyone that no one is perfect.People get scared sometimes.They hang out with popular people to be liked by their classmates.Then they learn their lesson.Then they become cool in their own way.I think people should read this book not only because it's a great book, but also because of the moral.
2366	Thanks for the Memories: Peter Mallory's rowing and coaching expertise is apparent in this easy to read and often very amusing book.Serious rowers and coaches certainly will find value in the book, whether they agree completely with Mallory or not.There is, however, a much broader audience for the book. Those of us who learned many of life's lessons while toiling on the river during our school years, and later moved on to lead normal lives, can find meaning in Mallory's often irreverent words.For us, it isn't so much the argument about rowing technique, as it is the book's ability to bring us back to the experiences that contributed to our desire and ability to achieve our goals in life.Thanks to the memories brought back by my old teammate Peter, once again I can confirm that indeed it was always the right decision to cut class in order to make it on time to practice on the river!
2367	Good quality computer animation: I found a copy of this in the $5.00 bin at my local Wal-Mart some time back and thought it looked interesting. I don't feel you are ever too old to enjoy a good animated film. Though I felt that the dialogue of one of the robots (Zeus) seemed a little stilted over all it's good clean entertainment suitable for even the very young. The only thing I regret is that the saga isn't complete in one volume. You end up with a cliffhanger unless you get a copy of the 2nd volume at the same time as you pick up the 1st. Young children will probably find it very entertaining.
2368	Very nice unit and very quiet.: I wanted a reliable disposal. Not only work great but, it does it very quietly> Got quotes from $75 to $125 for installation, the install took a total time, in and out the door, 30 mins.Love the unit. Would buy again.
2369	SPANISH EDITION: I preordered this book, thinking it was a continuance of Little Altars and The Divine Secret of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. I did not see anything that told what this book was about. I got it this week and was sick when I saw it was in Spanish. I was waiting for another sequal to the others. I was so disappointed. It is on its way back. I would recommend that someone put in the description that this is the Spanish Edition. Certainly someone that reads Spanish would love it. It would save the seller money. I don't think I am the only one that returned it at the seller's expense.
2370	Important story, well told: I found this on a young adult reading list, but it is suitable for adults as well. A warning for young people and especially those who want to suggest it to young people, it is very violent and graphic in some places. That is appropriate for the subject matter, but some readers might be disturbed by it. Those who expect a ghost story will be disappointed. I found it a fascinating and compelling story, very well told. I don't usually read war fiction, so I don't have the same standards as those who are looking for more technical information. It is an important story that needed to be told. Reading it in these times brings all sorts of modern resonances about war, prisoners, cultural differences to mind. The two one star reviews that this book has received so far seem to be from people who don't understand the rating system.
2371	A high price to pay for just four pieces of rubber!: There will be occasions when these clamp pads are useful, when their limited surface and rubber construction make them ideal.Yet, there will be times when they slip off, don't spread the pressure enough or just can't be found.The pony clam is a delightful clamp to use, but I'd rather just find a piece of scrap wood that is just the right size or spans two or more clamps.Save yourself the five dollars. After all it's a high price to pay for just four pieces of rubber!
2372	Norman Reedus: But the show is actually quite good, too. A very interesting adaptation of the graphic novel. Enough similarities to be familiar but enough changes to keep it exciting. And Norman Reedus.
2373	A good first step look at corporations: I only bought this book because I saw that it was recommended by Robert Kiyosaki in Rich Dad Poor Dad. And I have to agree with Kiyosaki that this is a good book for people who are buying their first book on corporations.McQuown does an exellent job explaining the various types of corporations and the incorporating process. You will find information on C-Corporations, S-Corporations and LLC's.This book is a good primer. In addition I recommend Rich Dad's Guide to Owning Your Own Corporation, Loopholes and Form Your Own Corporation and Launch a Business in Any State by J.W.Dicks.
2374	Avoid - waste of money: I saw the author on tv and wrote down his six elements for preparing for an emergency. I should have stopped there. There is nothing else of value in his book, and his six elements are rudimentary. Since he gave them on tv, I'll give them here so you can save your money: 1. Establish a network 2. Designate a team leader 3. Prepare a detailed contact list 4. Establish a command post 5. Choose a rendevous point 6. Pick a safe haven. I was already doing most of these, I just didn't call them what he calls them.I also agree with the other reviewers who state that this book was hastily put together to monopolize on the events of 9/11/01. The information on types of threats is simplistic to say the least. This book was a big disappointment.
2375	Same old, same old.: After listening to the CD, I couldn't tell if there was one song or 12. Everyone sounded just like the last one. The guys really need to get their stuff together and hopefully come up with a better variety of songs with their next album.
2376	deceptive description: I was very disappointed when I received my purchase. I was expecting stoneware dishes and did not expect plastic with the "Pfaltzgraff" pattern printed on. I did not see anywhere in the description that these dishes were melamine and not stoneware... maybe the price should have been a giveaway.
2377	I got a dud: Received this TV from amazon last night and within 30 min of turning it on, the sound went out. I've had more time to mess with all the settings today and everything is set properly. It doesn't seem to matter what I have hooked up to it as far as A/V equip goes either. Right now it's a basic coax cable, but no matter what channel, when it messes up, the whole TV is going haywire. After turning it off and then back on it fixes the problem, but only for a minute or so. After multiple experiments, it stays on for about 30 min after sitting turned off for an extended period of time, then after turning it off and on, it will only work for about one minute after....I did that about seven times and every time the sound messed up. About half the time the video was also scrambled and then went out....simply disappointed and frustrated as now I have to deal with Samsung customer service....awesome.
2378	Stalinism IS Socialism: Well I've read this book and quite frankly, I wasn't particulary impressed. But you have to hand it to Mr Matgamna, he sure does know how to write an introduction! In many ways, the intro is more useful, though I would wholeheartedly disagree with many of the points made, than much of the "critical texts" included thereafter.The fact is, Shachtman went over to the right wing at the end of his life afterleading the SWP for many years. I blame his views on the USSR and one notices how many ex-trots do this. Obviously their views on the USSR have a lot of factual basis to them , but it was the best we had and therefore worth defending to the hilt and fighting for. Stalinism was "actually exisiting socialism" and anyone who denys this, contradicts the actually existing state of play at the time up until the end of the Cold War, and in particular, up to the mid 1960s.Any socialist who wants to be educated should read this book, and then argue with it!
2379	Disappointed: I read all the rave reviews, and decided to purchase this book. If I had glanced through this book at a store, I would not have purchased it. It does have a lot of food counts in it, but it's very hard to read. Every food item has smaller subcategories, and sometimes I'm not sure what to look under because there are so many categories. It takes me a while to look something up. The print is so small, it's similar to looking at a dictionary. I was also expecting more restaurants. There are a few fast food places (not many), and no "sit down" dining, such as Olive Garden or Applebee's. I will be looking for a different food count book.
2380	On my top 10 Movies of All Times: This is an incredible documentary of bird migration. If the word "documentary" sounds boring to you, you are hugely mistaken. This includes footage that I have never seen anywhere else in my life. The scenery is breathtaking, the cinematography amazing. In the first 5 minutes you will think that the scenes were made in a studio. At the end, the DVD shows how they film was made and you are in for another surprise. The music that accompanies the movie is also amazing. A treat for the whole family.
2381	A-maze-ing!: From the first page, I was hooked on this book. A few pages later, I laughed at Killian's "literary appetite" and pitied his situation. Soon, you learn about Rick's problems. Because his life was endangered in a juvenile detention center, he embarked on a journey across the Southwest. He met Lon, a bird biologist who became like a father to him. I'm not a "nature girl" who often reads stories with male protagonists, but I immensely enjoyed "Maze". There were beautiful descriptions of the majestic landscape and an engaging plot. I wonder what'll happen to Rick in the future; however, dreaming up the outcome of a character's situation is part of the fun of reading a cliffhanger book. To anyone who loves tales of adventure with edge-of-your-seat suspense, I reccomend this book. My New Year's resolution: read more Will Hobbs books.
2382	The "bible" for doing Spain: We used this book to travel Spain for Spring Break. It does an amazing job on providing the precise items you need to travel spain with a wallet conscious mind. From clean affordable hostel recommendations to maps to sightseeing to getting around to nightlife, this book really did have it all. It's great for do-it-yourself traveling. Our trip was mostly unplanned, so we basically got to each city, picked up the book, and hit the streets. I highly taking some sort of guide when traveling abroad, and for low budget traveling, this book is it whether you go for one week or one month.
2383	Interminable: Amelia Peabody and her brood often take their time in geting down to the business of a tale. In Lord of the Silent, however, I wasn't sure if the action ever really started, despite a series of false apprehensions. Perhaps Peters bit off too much to chew: WW I, Egyptology, the antiques market, global spying and various household crises. A bit too cute, too precious, and too long.
2384	The Arrival: A Sci-Fi movie tale that features communications technologies, business politics and aliens focused on inhabiting Earth stumbled across by one man that no one believes.
2385	As good as a mid-90's screen saver: This is really dated and is really not something that should be bought these days. It was as good as a bunch of mid-90's screen savers.Very disappointing.
2386	Very good HRM.: This HRM does everything I need. Never have had any issues getting my HR to read out on the display. Works great and easy to use.
2387	Sci-Fi 80's TV: This was a huge series when I was in High School, everyone I knew, even teachers talked about it the next day.
2388	So junky: I was able to brew one pot with this thing. The second time I went to use it, it seemed like the heating element was burned out. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this.
2389	Fund raising made easy: This book has easy to follow, step by step plans for ways small entities can raise funds. There is enough variey in the types of projects described that any agency can choose the one that seems to suit the "personality" of the agency. It should make raising money seem less daunting and within the abilities of most people.
2390	Run for cover!!!!!!!: When I unpacked this thing this morning, I had a good laugh since I am the WORST when it comes to losing keys. My entire family was amused to see that it did just what it was supposed to do when we whistled....but then the phantom whistles began. This thing is SUPER sensitive. There is no way that I could keep this thing on my keychain, as the chirp is annoying and it seems like just about anything will set it off. Oh well.
2391	i enjoyed this book: this was a good book, it was a lil hard to follow but once you where done with it, it was very much worth it.
2392	Skip it!: This one's quite possibly one of the worst novels to come across my desk in several years: it's full of scientific inaccuracies (the author, for instance, places Kansas City on the Mississippi -- and has no concept at all of seismology) and strange prose (at least twice, she uses the "word" moveless).The plot -- such as it is -- is wildly unbelievable, with broad digressions only so that the author may insert political statements.Characters are pasted together out of cardboard, the scenery is... well, the scenery *isn't* and the plot is so riddled with inconsistencies, coincidences, and conspiracy-theory hokum as to be laughable. Were it possible to give it zero stars, I'd be happy to oblige.Give this one a wide berth in your reading!
2393	NICE TRY, BUT...: I've read all of Grisham's novels and this one is by far the weakest. I guess he should be given some credit for trying to get away from the tired formula of some of his recent books like The Partner and The Street Lawyer, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. In general, none of the characters are well developed or likeable: the whole lot is two dimensional and mean spirited. The constant jumping between the two story lines is very distracting, even though a second grader could see where things are headed. The ending is very abrupt and unsatisfying, like he saw this was a story not going anywhere and not worth saving. I would bet that if John Grisham's name was not on the jacket of this book, it would be on the express elevator to the 25 cent bargin bin.
2394	Wonderful resource for the entire year!: With chapters like "Just-me-and-mom time", "traveling made triumphant", and "Husbands have summers too", this book will become an invaluable addition to your bag of tricks. It includes recipes, activities, crafts, scheduling ideas, menus, sample charts for getting housework done, and more! This book is from a Christian stand point and mentions many biblical verses, making time for devotions, and lots of Christian music and book suggestions. I've already started working on our summer plans with my 7 year old, and he is getting very excited about all the possibilities this summer holds for us. Great buy, :)
2395	Whitecross CD High Gear: I am a Whitecross fan who owns and loves the first four CDs by this Christian heavy metal band, but I was greatly disappointed with this fifth album "High Gear" and everything that came after it. The first four albums were great Christian hard rock/metal music, but the "High Gear" CD was a wimpy pop rock CD.
2396	Infuriating! (And not in a good way.): Ugh. All I can say is ugh. I stuck through nearly 700 pages with such hope only to be dumped ceremoniously when our authoress realized that if she were truly going to do her story justice, she'd need to go on for another 700 pages! And it had such promise. Dad was suitably aloof, mysterious and yet loving. Daughter was slightly on the dull side but she had potential and was a good listener, which was really all that was required of her. Mom was loving and yet slightly sinister, weirdly believeable as a person. But it just tanked at the end.Another reviewer mentioned the lack of motivation of Vlad Tepes. HE'S DRACULA! He shouldn't need motivation! But that's what all the poking around in books made one expect. That and some nice parallel Cold War intrigue that also never manifested.If you're way into "enjoying the journey" and don't generally concern yourself with plot, go for it. If you expect an author who respects your time and intelligence, I'd take a pass.
2397	book: I really enjoyed reading this book, came very quickly in the mail and without damage. yes I would order this item again.
2398	Very Plastic Looking: I have ordered other plants but this particular one is very plastic looking when placed next to the others. very disappointed.
2399	Great learning tool: This book has really helped me better understand the basics of trend following. Seldom do you run across a book with so much information. Highly recommended
2400	Defective, no directions or tips: I expected directions or tips (second story is better than first story, clean the surface first and wet the area or dampen...). Also, the house has little holes where it locks together, so the smaller seeds fall right through. The main problem is the suction cups. They are warped. They are not flat so that they can not create an air-tight suction seal. One suction cup was a little less warped, but since the other one was completely warped, it wouldn't hold up and the house fell immediately from the second story...seed everywhere. Wrote to manufacturer to see if they would just send me some good suction cups, instead of having to go through the return process. Feel bad for the kids. They were so excited about it. We hear lots of wild birds and owls in our eaves right near where I wanted to place the house.
2401	Back stretcher: This item is constructed VERY WELL. It appears very durable and it really helps my low back. Folds up nice and small and it unfolds easily and quickly. When I bought it I thought "If this doesn't work I am going to return it." ..well I still have it and plan to keep it for many years of use. I recommend it as an aid to reduce back pain & I have recommended it to some co-workers when they asked me about what was helping my low back pain. Works nicely.
2402	Cool: standard ruix cube but wish the sticks would stay on longer than a couple of weeks. Seems as if I'll need to buy crazy glue
2403	The BEST resource for poets looking to get published!: My poetry ezine is now listed in Poet's Market. Poet's Market is THE definitive resource for poets looking to get their work published![...]
2404	Wonderful Basic Book on Brazilian Spirituality: I have been a practitioner of Wicca for years, and recently have been attracted to Brazilian spirituality as a way to expand my knowledge and strenghten my faith. This is the first book I've read that puts it all in the proper perspective. It is intelligent, well written with a good sense of humor as well as a seriousness of purpose. The author quite obviously knows her stuff and is an adept at both Wicca and Umbanda. She makes this primer on the submject of Brazilian folk religions intelligible and fascinating. In a world where we are being torn apart by religion, I think it is wonderful that somebody is celebrating the similarities and explaining some of the differences so we can all understand and appreciate each other. I applaud Morwyn's effort. I hope she comes out with more books soon.
2405	Torch edition of "The Transformaton of Man": Like all Mumford's books, there are such erudite analogies in this one that you have new tangents to explore. As Volume Seven of "World Perspectives" it was first printed in hard cover in 1956. The Torch edition was published in 1972 with his new intro acknowledging a widening of his own perceptions and that ends, "The more hopeless our present situation seems, confronted...by both ecologically unbalanced environments and psychological unbalanced minds, the more imperative it is not to lose hope... The coming generation still has man's oldest [option], cultivating the arts that make man human."
2406	OUTSTANDING!: I just picked up a copy yesterday. I was so surprised to see it out already. This book was a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. I love all of Julie Garwood's Historicals, and I was a little weary about a Contemporary, but if you read Julie Garwood, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK! WOW! It was incredible! I plan to reread it tonight! :) Ms. Garwood is a fantastic writer!
2407	What a drag......: Too many characters and sub-plots, filler drivel, and male macho baloney. This is not my first Baldacci book, but unfortunately, my last.
2408	Pretty Sad.....: The special effects were pretty good, but the plot, the acting, and the dialogue was horrible. The first 5 minutes of the movie I was laughing so hard because Motaro and Sheeva looked so cheap! The special effects are the only thing that made this movie "Mortal Kombat." Some of the actors did really well, but the parts that were given to them sucked so much, they were probably laughing at themselves. I think this movie should've been a japanimation.
2409	worked a little over a year and then nothing...: While it was working, this was a good product. I liked that you could change display from glaring bright to inverse so that driving at night was not quite to hard to do. After a little over a year of being used every other day though, the component no longer recognizes that an iPod is connected. I've tried every iPod I own and nothing works. Harman/Kardon offers no individual parts for this unit on their website, so I cannot check to see if it is the cord or the unit. Was a Christmas gift from my boyfriend and I don't have the heart to tell him that it has died already. I would not purchase it again.
2410	NOT THE CORRECT MODEL!: I ordered the TRU9460-2 and Amazon sent me the TRU9465 (which is what the picture is of on this Web page). I spoke to customer service and they had me send back the original item and they said they would send me out the correct item. I just received the package and *again* they sent me the TRU9465. The phone itself may be great but Amazon is *not* fulfilling these orders properly. They are advertising one model and shipping another. And their customer service is clueless! Somebody at Amazon needs to wake up!
2411	RAD movie: RAD is the ultimate BMX movie. It is a movie about the underdog struggling to get to the top, or in Cru Jones case, the ability to prove himself. The action on bicycles in this movie started a freestyle frenzy all over the world. Guy's like Eddie Fiola and Martin Aparijo played a significant part in the film. When I first saw this movie I begged my parents to buy me a freestyle bike to do the tricks I saw in the film, that was in 86 and I still consider BMX to be an important part of my life, thanks to this film. Bmx did not fade out, look at DAve Mirra, if anything it has certainly grew. This movie is hard to find and it is something I treasure very much. I strongly encourage you to express your interest in this film and the release of it on DVD.
2412	A very simplistic view of melanoma and treatment of same.: As a stage IV melanoma patient, I found this book to be overly simplistic in its views and treatment of melanoma. I have never heard a doctor say it is "totally curable" as it can show up many years later with even a different primary, but yet this book states if "caught early it can be totally cured." The book is a good basis for someone that is just wanting to learn about melanoma but not do serious research. This book could be better if it spent more time researching the genetics of melanoma and less time concentrating totally on the sunscreen aspect of melanoma. Many patients that are not "sun worshipers" or have not had sun burns still contract melanoma.
2413	A really good movie: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about a kid that discovers he has magical powers. He is given an opportunity to go to a school where he can train his powers and make new friends. Harry encounters many perils along the way and must defeat them with his new friends and his magical powers. From dragon eggs to flying brooms this is a very exiting movie. The DVD can only make it better. This is a great movie for all ages. DEFINENTLY RECCOMENDED!
2414	Super Easy to Program: Bought this remote after having good luck with a Logitech Harmony 659. I almost didn't buy because local prices were well over $450. But, even though it's the top of the Logitech line in price, the features and programmability are worth the extra $$. Plus price was right on Amazon.I can control my television, stereo, DVD, lights, anything that is IR programmable. The product database was very extensive. When I press "Watch a DVD" the TV input changes, the surround sound selects cinema sound, the DVD turns on and ejects, and the lights dim....all with the push of one button!Only reason for not having a five star rating would be for the fact that it doesn't have Bluetooth. Can't control my Playstation3. But this is probably more of a Sony issue than a Logitech.
2415	Amazing! Worked for 3 year old.: I waited to review this product to see if our results would be long lasting. My 3-1/2 year old was a finger sucker day and night since about birth and had started to chew all his fingernails. My husband kept telling me that we had to stop him for at least a month to break the habit. It worked beautifully. I just had to remember to apply the stuff. Amazing!
2416	worst geometry book ever: i feel bad for anyone who has this book. be ready to do poorly. easily the worst math book i've ever encountered. problems are just not sufficiently explained
2417	Very pleased: Purchased this jogger for the whole family to use. We really like the oval shape because it provides a larger jumping space for a wider variety of moves (jumping jacks etc.). The bar really enhances our ability to use the jogger because we feel more stable and less apt to accidentally jump/fall off the surface. Wonderful for kids - provides a great opportunity to exercise/burn off excess energy regardless of the weather.
2418	Absolutely the best: For weeks I had been searching for an mp3 player that also recorded voice, and I kept reading really bad reviews on most of them. Finally, I went to an electronics store and saw the iRiver iHP 120 and immediately wanted it. I don't regret getting it. Transferring music is soooooooooo easy and just about anyone can do it. Searching for music is also easy if you orgnize your music, it has an internal and external microphone and comes with its own carrying case!The remote control works great and I have not had any problems with it. I give iPod a lot of credit, but if they had a voice recording feature, I probably would not have come upon this great item.
2419	fair: if i could do it over again I would not get this book even thought i only paid .1 and 3.99 shipping it is a decent book to get from a libart but not to own
2420	Decent: The books was not in the condition that it was listed to be. The book itself was amazing. Had all the information I was looking for.
2421	Don't Believe the Hype: The problem with this movie is the way it was promoted. One of the first cast interviews I saw was Sigourney Weaver saying how the movie was scarier than Alien and that she was having trouble sleeping at night. From that point on I could hardly wait to see The VillageSigourney Weaver was lying! as was all the hype about this movie a lie.It's too bad because it was a good movie, but because of the LIE most people are disappointed.M. Night Shyamalan could have just went with the secrecy hype and people would have liked the movie, instead as you are reading most hated it.
2422	no details, no discussion: The good news is, the DVD is well filmed and divided up well into chapters. The bad news is---the techniques are not broken down or discussed at all. What you have is a woman saying-for example-"here is a defense against a punch"....and that is the extent of the discussion. There is no details of how the techs should be done, what they are doing or what the major points are. And a fair number of the techniques are fairly sloppy. If I could get my money back I would.Brian Kennedy
2423	Why Bother?: Jimmy gets a writing credit on 4 of the 14 songs on here. My question is, if he really doesn't have anything to say, why would I want to listen? It is a shame JB is diluting his strong catalog with his last several bland offerings.
2424	Absolutely worthless: The worst book I have ever bought. The writing is horrible and the content is absolutely useless. I couldn't even finish it, for it was so painful.
2425	A fun read and page-turner: I don't often read fiction but I decided to make an exception with this title and I'm glad I did. In some ways, the fictional town is like Mayberry-everyone knows everyone else's business and secrets. Most of the plot twists and turns have an edge of good humor and fun to them. Most of the characters are strong and believeable. Unlike Mayberry, under the veneer of comedy, there is a lot of drama going on with people dealing with real life, 21st Century issues. The book ties together without being formulaic and leaves room for a sequel-which I am strongly anticipating.
2426	Suitable for Backpackers: The title is unsuitable. There is nothing 'ultimate' about this package, which seems to target a low budget, backpacking type of audience. The attractions are slanted in favor of what you might call 'hippie' interests. I am left with a lot of questions and a strong feeling of disillusionment. Most of the activities can be done practically anywhere, and there is little focus on unique local entertainment, gifts or dining beyond what you find in somebody's cabin out in the boonies. I'm a middle aged boomer with an interest in comfort - not camping - and a memorable travel experience with shows and food and special gifts, and want to believe the region has something to offer my market, so I will look for more current information. That said, if I was a teenager looking for an affordable adventure, this video would be a good place to start.
2427	I stayed up for THIS ?: When i started watching chasing amy i loved it thought i might want to record it WELL THANK GOD I DIDN'T. The first part of chasing amy i loved but the end was simply Idiotic.this movie was a total letdown and i wish i had never seen it. Jay & silent bob didn't show up till the end,which totally.... I could have written this movie better....
2428	Fascinating, Enjoyable, Dramatic: I enjoyed this book. It's an interesting, fast-paced story, despite the peculiar writing style. There were fluctuating POV's (omnipresent, first person, third person) and redundancies. Despite this, it's a good story and the author is a great storyteller. ChocolateSleuth.com recommends this as a great quick read that will have you turning pages until the end.It's the story of Evelyn, a young girl who grew up hard, making mistakes along the way until a life-changing experience--the murder of the father of the baby she carries, leads her to change her life. A colorful cast of well-fleshed characters and snappy dialogue keeps the story moving. I found it hard to put this book down. There is strong violence and sex scenes, so this is not a read for the faint of heart. I'd love to read G. Lawrence's future offerings.
2429	Book was damaged: The book I purchased was described to be "like new," but had pages missing and had water damage on the cover.
2430	Disappointing: Spider-Man has had a pretty good track record when it comes to the DS, which is part of what makes Spider-Man: Friend or Foe so disappointing. The game's premise is quite interesting though: to stop a massive, mystery threat, Spidey must team up with a laundry list of his rogues gallery (Green Goblin and Doc Ock among others) and take down hordes of other baddies. While Friend or Foe starts out fun, the repetitive beat downs quickly degenerate into sheer boredom. The game looks decent enough, and the characters are well animated, and the moments of voice work are a nice touch too, but there's simply not enough here to warrant more than a rental at best, and that may be too generous. There's some fun moments here and there, but in the end, Spider-Man: Friend or Foe ends up being another quickly assembled, rushed out, licensed game that could have been better than it is.
2431	Worse Than Bad: These disks cause my DVR to freeze for 5 minutes or more, and will not record. The time wasted trying to make them work I will never get back. I have used TDK DVD-R before, and they performed very well. These +R are complete junk and I am throwing them out. Never again.
2432	Anything but "Soulful": I thought he sounded great on AI. What happened here???His voice sounds computerized on this CD and most of the lyrics are god-awful. Here's an example: Girl this is my sorry for 2004 and I ain't gonna mess up no more, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, etc.Pick it up used if you must, but it isn't worth the full-price.
2433	Killed a tree for what????: Being a relative newcomer to the world for AIX I thought that this book would be an answer to a few of my question. All that it left me with is more questions unanswered and lighter in the wallet. It claims to be a "Fast AIX answer book for the experienced UNIX pro" but all I found it to be is a fast waste of time and money. Shame on me for buying it and shame on Bonnie for writing it. Thats my opinion and I am sticking to it.....
2434	Paige Dalporto's Poetry: From big black coal carsthat travel to Heaven and ride among the stars,to his vivid descriptions of trees and West Virginia landscapes, this is one true example of turning coal dust into a real diamond of a book. The pictures are priceless, as well. Wait till you see where the Raven is sitting. I loved it. A real slice of Appalachia.
2435	don't like: I don't like it, I bought it for back support and I find It is very uncomfortable to drive with.
2436	such an old product: I received a "THAYERS rose petal witch hazel" , but I saw "2007/11" on the bottom. After check previous reviews, I know I am cheated too.
2437	Another rip-off: This is another one of those CD's featuring re-makes of hits by one or more of the original artists. If you're interested in a 4+ minute version of Tobacco Road with fuzz-tone guitar, this may be for you. If you want the original hits, look elsewhere.
2438	Hypocrisy, ain't it cool?: This man is simply a hypocrite. He claims to want everyone to find themselves and choose for themselves, yet will dictate to them how to do so. It's like the concept of a self help book, how do you "help yourself", yet you're reading how to do so from someone else.Also, those hardline a-holes (I'd go for the gold, but hey, it's Amazon) here on Amazon trashing Maddox. Consider this, Maddox generate thousands of hits a day to his site, yet he has no advertising whatsoever on his site. He makes no profit from the website itself. Moving on, the broad assumption that Maddox readers are unintelligent and will do nothing in life, heh, that's a laugh. I had no idea I was an idiot, I mean, you guys must be blessed to be following a man who contradicts himself on a consistent basis like Billy boy...oh, well...probably the same people who think Bush can do no wrong.
2439	No more mosquitos!!: This product is excellent. My daughter gets ravaged by mosquitos every summer. We have tried everything out there to prevent this. She would still wake up with at least 10 bites every night. Since we purchased the Mosquito-contro she has been fine. it is amazing.
2440	an almost complete waste of time: Buckley is obviously a sincere believer in Catholicism, and it is for that reason, and that reason only, that he wrote this book. ... It is not an autobiography, nor is it in any way spiritual. It deals with a few intellectual issues in Catholicism, and a few religious stories from his life. If you're looking for a way to pass the day without rousing your intellect, read this book. Or read a better book.
2441	Not just for Officers to read: I served 23 years as an enlisted. I never had much interest in reading a book on past Commandants, I just never felt I could identify with them, therefore I never read the book. Was I ever wrong! First of all, there appears to have been a frequent effort to abolish the Marine Corps for approximately 160 years. I just never knew how concerted the efforts were. It was all about precious defense funds and distribution among the other services. Great strategy by Commandants through the ages on always ensuring we were ready to fight at a moments notice. The vision and efforts by the 20th century Commandants was really very remarkable. The book is written in small chapters, one per Commandant; most chapters approximately 10 - 15 pages.
2442	Grand old classic of boy becoming man in the Age of Chivalry: A wonderful story of life in the Middle Ages. A boy finds himself sent by his impoverished, blind father to a castle to serve as a squire. There he grows up, learns to become a knight, and begins to learn the reasons why his father had sent him there: to position him to challenge his father's enemy at the court of Henry IV and restore the family fortune and good name. A little romance even occurs for the lad. The style is a little quaint, as I believe this book was written at the end of the nineteenth century, but in the context of this tale of ancient times, it feels right anyway! A good tale for young men and women about the triumphs of right over wrong, and the importance of standing up for what you believe in. Great illustrations by the author.
2443	Solemn and special: Good book on the life of Jesus-the -child with excellent historical background of 1st century Judea. Rice beautifully re-creates the possible life of 7 year old Christ just after the return to Nazareth from Egyptian hide-out. It's an interesting approach to Jesus humanity and divinity without much of pompous characterization. The book should be a good read for believers and non-believers alike. However, I have decided not to give 5 stars, because throughout my reading I was unable to be connected to book and care about the story, and even at times I was thinking to abandon or rush to the conclusion. At the end, I stayed to the end, and enjoyed the marvels and hardships of the one year in Jesus earthly life. I hope, Anne Rice will continue with adult life of Jesus.
2444	nice machine: I got this pasta machine for my Fiancee for Christmas. She has been wanting one for some time. We used it last night for the first time and she was able to make very nice pasta with it. It rolled out nice even sheets and when we lat the dough dry properly it cut nice spaghetti. We will see how well it holds up, but it seems to be well made.
2445	Does not work for me either.: Like most of the reviews this thing has not worked for me. I will try getting some new software.
2446	1/3 good, 1/3 so so & 1/3 awful: Perhaps this book suffered from the expectations of this reader; another problem may have been that I read the reviews prior to reading the book. All that aside I can only state that this book was a disappointment. Mr. Harris started off well, and the plot moved rapidly for the first third of the book, after that it detiorated rapidly, culminating in the finale, the inane ending. Awful! Even with a substantial discount this book is not worth buying.
2447	The Best Show On TV You're Probably Not Watching: Just read all of these reviews. There is a reason so many people have chosen to review both this and the season 2 dvd box set. They are amazing! This is by far the funniest show ever produced. Better than Seinfeld, The Simpsons, etc. Once in a lifetime does a show this perfect come around. The writing, cast, and production are perfect. What else can be said?
2448	Why So Loved?: I am sorry to say that this is one of the most worst novels I've read in some time. ... Overall the story is fair, but the execution of character and story development are sloppy and underdeveloped. Please add my voice of reason to your online reviews. This book is not worth investing in. Thanks.
2449	Useless: I bought this based on all the positive reviews. The sound quality of the speaker is excellent. The problem is the people I talk to can't hear me. They all say it has a lot of bacground noise, and I have a quiet vehicle. They also say it breaks up a lot so I have to tuen it off to talk to them. I might have been better off burning the 35.00 for this, at least I would have felt some warmth.
2450	Wow the price has gone up!!!: I have had this product for a long time. It has great sound and amazing ability to pick up far away stations. I have never had a problem mechanically, (the outside has worn a bit). I am very surprised on the price though. I bought it for $129 and it has gone the opposite way of most electrical products - UP!! And it is no different now than 5 yrs ago.
2451	Nice Kiddie Book with Nice Picutres but not for an older kid like me: I like the colour in the book, the pictures and illustrations after very nice, indeed!However, I did not fancy it as a book for someone over 8 years old (I am almost a teen). The reading level is for someone my age, but the design for someone much younger.Therefore, after our family took off on a vacation and we stayed at Cork Harbour, the car was the best place for it, stuck it in the boot!
2452	I got totally screwed by this product: Ordered in July of 2012 and the product arrived broken. Something is broken either with the shaft or the drive-mechanism because the trimmer-head barely spins even with the engine going full blast.Being gas-powered, I'm unable to return it to Amazon.I called Poulan's customer service (HA!) number and arrived at a call-center that manages calls for a multitude of makes/models of lawn equipment. Basically they said to take it to an authorized service center, and the rep gave me 2 numbers of local companies. The first company was out of business and the second one wants $35 bucks simply to LOOK at the unit.Sooo.....Long story short - I paid $120 bucks for a brand new trimmer that DOES NOT work out of the box and will cost me an additional $35 to get one that does work?If anybody has a phone# direct to Poulan - please share.
2453	Sound coming in is good, going out crummy!: I bought this as a trial for someone else. So I have several to compare it to. The "clip" on the ear is evidently made for someone other than my size and shape of ear. It is not comfortable, nor does it keep it firmly in my ear.The sound coming from the other party is fine, just a little softer than the average earphone. The special mic which is supposed to reduce wind noise evidently reduces your voice with no wind noise. To attain the same pickup as say a Jabra c500, you would have to tape the microphone to your bottom lip. Needless to say, the person I talked to kept asking me to speak up. I bought two of these to check out and they both performed the same sad way.So if you want to hold the mic to your lips, get this unit. If you want both hands free, don't try it.
2454	Sooner or later.....: I knew the reviews before buying one...I enjoyed the huge memory space...It worked flawlessly, right up until suddenly it started making a bad noise. The only thing worse than losing an image, is losing hundreds of them. It worked for a little over a year, being used on a sporatic basis. I wouldn't recommend anyone buys them ever.
2455	Same Old Same Old: There is nothing new here. The text fails to take into account the personalities and politics of individual organizations and the differing needs of individual B2C or B2B customers. You can not prescribe a cure without a careful diagnosis of the problem. The book is shallow at best.
2456	Tepid: Yes--I am not surprised you are ambivalent about Rameau after this lukewarm and unmagical performance--By now I hope you have found pleasure through Christie--Gardener--Minkowski- who really know how to make Rameau shine--and who do NOT--as the otherwise admirable Leppard does here--reduce the tempo's to Handelian slowness. It IS lighter music--but for that has a savor of its own---Rameau is a master in his way as Handel in his.. Nice singing--but,again,too ponderous from the opening overture and throughout......
2457	Sharp but shoddy scissors: Chicago Cutlery Insignia Kitchen Scissors looked great but had multiple problems. While meant to help with thorough cleaning, the hinge did not function well causing them to easily separate into two pieces. A couple of trips to the dishwasher resulted in early signs of rusting.While a nice idea the openers at the bottom were more in the way than functional.After using them a few times I donated them to a charity hoping another would find them more useful.
2458	What is this??: This is sheer crap!! I am offended that someone would actually produce something so crappy. These songs don't do any justice to John Mayer as an artist. I swear, they made a mockery of his music.
2459	They don't make them like they used to!: This toy is completely useless. They have made the pegs shorter, so that they do not stay in place. My daughter (3) was so frustrated with it that I came to help her. Every time I (and I am 40 years old) put a peg in, several others fell out. If I had been by myself, I would have been swearing like a sailor! Do not waste your money! To top it all off, they only give you 8 pages of pictures. Ugh!
2460	Stick with it....It's worth it.: Typical of Charles Dickens tales, this story does not shy away from showing us the seedier side of life. But, that's what makes the good guys so compelling; the contrast to the low-lifes around them. In this case both the low-lifes and the heroes come from all ranks of society, from "dust men" and river people to the social elite. The contrasting conditions of these different classes is the real crime.Unfortunately, with the pace rather slow and the story line so dark, it may be difficult to get into this movie. I almost turned it off after about half an hour. But, I'm glad I stuck with it. As the characters developed, I was drawn into the story more and more. It ends well also which for me is the real pay off. Charles Dickens is still a little dark for my taste, but, I found this piece very much worth the time to watch it. And, if you are a real C.D. fan, you will want to add this DVD to your collection.
2461	Plocky's Sweet Smokey Chipotle Whole Grain Tortill...: I think Plocky's brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but I found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy.
2462	Yes, Gorgio: This movie may be a bit thin in the plot department but the music is wonderful. I ordered it specifically so we could enjoy listening to Pavarotti. While we wanted it for a Italian theme film night, we play it frequently just for the music.
2463	Laswell knows how to make it sing!: Paul's words are brought to life and float above Laswell's soundscapes to create such a welcoming, warm atmosphere! Just as Las did with Burroughs'(Material's) "Seven Souls",the words are given a place to reside instead of being starkly alone. Ugh, this album is just so beautiful! I have to reccomend another spoken-word album that Las pulled together as well--"Myth: Dreams of the World"; get it before it becomes extinct!
2464	Max Pressure is 100PSI not 150PSI: the description said it was max 150PSI but the one i got said 100 Max PSI and i didnt realize it said that a till after it stopped working.
2465	just plain bad: This album is amazingly bad. Wow. This album is so bad, that I decided to write my first ever Amazon review. This album made me give up my traditional role of reader. The rhymes aren't clever or interesting. Uh. And the music, wow, that is bad too. It's like English bad techno by the book. It is essentially a gimic album, with the gimic being that he is English, and says stuff like 'Birds.' English people can rap, just not this guy. Once again, so bad.
2466	Not excited: In search of a better understanding of the essence of Native American cremonial music, I found myself quite dissapointed on hearing this CD. Reading each song title as I went. I discovered the same two songs repeating over and over, as the titles changed. This CD does a disservice to Native American culture by not properly crediting the tribal origin of each song.
2467	Terrible Customer Service: I am so frustrated with this company. I bought footed p.j.'s for my teenage kids for Christmas. When the p.j.'s arrived, I wrapped them and put them under the tree for Christmas. Unfortunately, Christmas was over 14 days away. On Christmas morning, one of the kids' p.j.'s were too small. I immediately wrote an email to jumpinjammerz, asking them what I needed to do to exchange for a larger size. Wait a few days, no response. I emailed again, three more times over the next 3 weeks. No response at all. Today I called them. I was politely told that since the order was over 14 days ago, I cannot exchange, I cannot have a refund, I don't even get a token discount on a pair to replace the ones they won't take back. What a waste of money. Even though the product is nice, I will not do business with the company again.
2468	A legend: The digital quality of the DVD has given the film a freshness consistent with its age, but it must be kept in mind that the effects were made with the technology of today. As such, none of the effects look dated, and the background music sounds familiar at times, but scenes such as the the talent show were significant accomplishments and still come off as impressive.Mean Girls as entertainment and for what it is: as fiction, not as history. There is so much to enjoy and appreciate.
2469	printing error: This would be a great book except for a color printing error. The pigs change from orangish to green in the book and back again. In addition, one page shows cans of paints tipped over and the color and the labels are incorrect- the blue label is with the pink, etc. I am waiting for a new one from Amazon but I am not convinced the customer service rep understood the issue. Will be disappointed to get another bad copy!
2470	Contains MSG: The "yeast extract" in this product acts as MSG does. It is ridiculous that Annie's markets itself as a healthy company for kids and then fills their products with insane amounts of sodium and food additives. Please research all the ingredients before giving these to your children, they are not as healthy as they would have you think.
2471	A mixed bag.: Although it contains some passages of sublime and sensuous description,Camus's early blueprint of "The Outsider" generally misfires,due to dramatic weaknesses,over-formal plotting and thin characterisation.A tedious and unmemorable work that ranks far below "The Outsider","The Rebel"and "The Myth of Sisyphus."
2472	I'm... well, I'm downright dissapointed!!: Don't get me wrong.I have become one of the many loyal readers enthralled with the Epic Adventure that places you right in the midst of the fantasy lives & events throughout the series. I've journeyed with thousands of others through every smile, every laugh & giggle, and even sometimes through a tear or two. But I almost couldn't wait until the end of the book, and I also skipped a few pages where the text just seemed to drag-on (no pun intended).To my astonishment there was not even a single battle that I was aware of, and I am VERY sad to say that CoT could EASILY have been left out altogether and not even missed!!!R.J. I hope the next book redeems you.
2473	Many Good Songs Worth Buying: I think Abba is so underrated, because their harmonies are so absolutely beautiful. This CD has several songs on it that are worth buying to keep..."The Visitors" is a song that is just fun to hear. But others, like "One of Us" and "Like an Angel Passing thru my Room" are those stop still songs that make you pause and remember. A song that can be sad "Slipping through My Fingers" is so gorgeous and so relatable to anyone seeing their child growing up, and it was just featured in the "Mamma Mia" film. Note the beauty of the front cover of the CD...the rich golden color and the way the members are standing apart, with the ceilings high around them. It is worth a buy because it's not all about one good song. Let's get back to worthwhile, classy music.
2474	Very Pretty: I received my picture a little late because of a typo in the address. Don't know who's fault that was but as soon as I let them know I received a quick response to my email and it was reshipped. I love the picture which was printed on very nice heavy duty paper. Unfortunately, I did not notice when I ordered it that it had the writing on the bottom. So that was why I gave it four stars. It makes it look more like a poster, rather than a picture, so just make sure you look for that when you order. Very satisfied with the customer service - will deal with this company again.
2475	No info on US history, just sad stories about proletariat.: This book can be named anything else, but US History-there is little history and less US here.
2476	Good product but.....: Enviro shower chlorine filter is an excellent product. The first time I used it I saw a considerable difference in the texture of my skin and hair. I was so pleased to find out there was a replacement cartridge available for less than half the price of the whole filter. What I don't like about this product is that it leaks. Even after several attempts to reinstall it, it still leaked. Finally, we patched it up with some type of shower tape. And guess what: it still leaks.So I would give five stars for the whole filter but not for the replacement product although it does such a good job of removing chlorine.
2477	very pleased: Works like a charm. Great for doing small jobs when you do not want to bring out the big routers
2478	Little Earthquakes: This album is probably my favorite of all time. I am not as much a "Tori-phile" as I once was, but that doesn't diminish my love for this compilation of music. Nothing she, or anyone else, has done can compare.
2479	BrewStation Exceeds Expectations: I almost bought this a year ago but chose a traditionl coffee maker. I have been suffering long enough. The BrewStation makes GREAT coffee and it stays good. I would recommend this maker to anyone. Reasonable price and much better coffee than I expected. It's as good as "Coffee Shop" coffee.I Love My BrewStation!!!!!!
2480	"Like a thousand bluebirds screaming...": I heard Patti Smith say that Tom Verlaine played guitar "like a thousand bluebirds screaming." A peculiar comment, but an accurate one. The ten-minute title track of Marquee Moon contains a long solo of Verlaine dueling with Richard Lloyd, and it does sound like a thousand bluebirds screaming. Of course, this album is so often namechecked by modern bands it's become cliche to mention it, but it truly is a great album. I won't go into details...it's too difficult to describe a band like Television with things so trivial as words. Get this album and experience it for yourself.
2481	Number stamp: Works great... The price for a numbering stamper is very good. The imprint after you ink it up is very readable.
2482	Booby trapped with fault copy right protection.: The album is great. It is a shame that Sony choose to load this album with such horrible copy right protection. After I noticed some fine print on the back of the dual disk CD that "may not play on some CDs or DVDs" I was told there was a compliant CD. Didn't note that there was yet more fine print about CP on this one as well. After placing in my CD player, it crashed autorun, hung explorer and dont even think about using ITunes. Then I see Mark's Sysinternals Blog with even more horror stories about what sony's softwear will do to you. So Im stuck with a very expensive coaster since I can't return it.Gee Sony, way to go making another happy customer. and this one actually tried to buy it!
2483	Shallow Characters: Ann Hood's novel about a pregnant teenager and a mourning widow was full of shallow characters and a jumbled plot. The conversations were simple and provided little insight into what each character was feeling. I forced myself to finish this book and was not surprised when the end was exactly what I had expected.
2484	For those new to reincarnation: Brian Weiss MD makes it very clear at the beginning of the book of his strictly scientific background and his need of scientific proof before accepting new concepts in the medical field. So it was undoubtedly a surprise for him in the course of hypnotherapy on one client to find the client regressing to previous lives, and further to hear voices of "masters" from the spiritual realm giving information on the lessons of one's lives on earth. This kind of experience must have been fascinating and his account of it is wonderful - as is the amazing progress his client makes through a number of regression sessions. Since I am already a believer in reincarnation I did not get as much out of this book as "Only Love is Real". However, for people who are new to the concept of reincarnation or are a little doubtful of it, this book offers a lot.
2485	Very informative: This is a picture of America that you don't get elsewhere! She worked inside fast food restaurants to research this book, and I think she has done a stellar job here. Any American could learn a lot from reading this fine, fine book.
2486	Horrible!!: I never received this video. I e-mailed them about it and they never responded. I am very unhappy!!
2487	Disappointed: I am a working mother of two small children with a husband that travels 90% of the time. Needless to say, it is a struggle to provide a home cooked meal for my kiddos. I thought a slow cooker would be the answer. Yesterday, after fighting my way through a snowy rush-hour with two moaning kids, I was not greeted with the good smells of a home-cooked meal. Rather, I was greeted by the stench of burning food and spent the next half hour scraping black food from the bottom of the slow-cooker.I was well-aware of the issues of it cooking too hot, so I cut the cooking time in half - it was on low for 2 hours and then switched to warm... and that was the result.I do not recommend this product if you are using it for its intended purpose - to fix it and forget it!
2488	Poor quality.: The inserts that the pegs screw into are very loose. 4 of the 8 came out completely and are useless until I fix them myself.
2489	Truthful American voice.: I first heard this voice on a CD I bought on a whim when I was interested inthe music of Steven Foster. Her version of "Beautiful Dreamer" (a song I've loved sice childhood) was so perfect, I had to hear more. This woman is a hidden American treasure!
2490	Sordid Funny!: I knew by the title-Sordid Lives, and the trailer on the cover, this had to be a funny movie! We all know someone who resembles the characters in this film from the the in-the-closet son to the neurotic mother of the in-the-closet son. It's side splitting funny and Delta Burke puts in a fantastic performance of the put upon wife! It's a must see film!
2491	SO CUTE!: I used these to go along with my daughter's halloween costume but she ended up wearing them all the time. They are so cute I wanted her to get more wear out of them than just one night. They run a little small. We got so many positive comments about them. They are so cute.
2492	TIME TRIAL IS TERRIFIC: As a mystery author, I had the honor of moderating an author panel at a recent Left Coast Crime convention upon which R.E. Derouin sat. I read TIME TRIAL in preparation for my moderator duties, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. TIME TRIAL takes place in Mr. Derouin's adopted hometown of Ouray Colorado. Detective David Dean has left his home in Pennsylvania to recover from gunshot wounds. He finds trouble follows him to scenic Colorado, and TIME TRIAL is a fast-paced and complex thriller. I recommend it highly, as I do the other works by Ray Derouin, a talented writer, as well as a charming and interesting man.
2493	very happy: My son enjoyed the movie. He loves the story and the music. He likes music from that era and it was a fun movie to watch. He has watched it several times. It came when it was supposed to and he was very pleased with it.
2494	Diamond in the Rough: An very good film, but not for everyone. It has a slow and deliberate pace with very little action. It's all about the story and the mood, not special effects. The acting and casting was excellent, with the exception of Elijah Wood. While he does a good job acting, I think he was miscast in his role. The musical score is fantastic as is the directing and cinematography. It all helps to set the mood.The only place where Ash Wednesday falls short is in the lack of depth to the story. Burns did a good job with it, but would have been well advised to enlist the aid of a co-writer. I can't help but feel the story was lacking a certain ingredient that would have really brought it alive.Ash Wednesday could have been a masterpiece but the storyline doesn't quite make it.That said, Ash Wednesday is very good and I highly recommend it. Most films you pick will not be as good.
2495	Horrible!: I bought this after my pure vanilla from Mexico ran out. It is horrible! It smells more like cough syrup than vanilla. I left it on the counter for a week with the lid off hoping to let some of the alcohol evaporate. It did not work. I used it today for the first time, again hoping it would work better than it smells, but my baked goods taste bad too. I love baking, but I would rather use imitation before I use this again! What a waste of money!
2496	Getting worse as they go: This was truly just blood and gore! There really wasn't even suspense. Just blood and gore and more blood and gore...
2497	Thought it was broken, other review helped fix it.: Used AquaClear filters for various tanks back in the '90s and loved them. Recently started keeping a tank again, but decided to try for a planted tank. Had the same problem as another reviewer and thought that my filter died after an outage. Unplugged it and let it sit for a day and then plugged it back in to make sure it was really dead. Surprisingly it started right back up again without problems. A few months later a rogue plant was starting to clog the intake, so I unplugged the filter to clean the intake tube out. Plugged it back in and the filter didn't turn back on. Waited a day and plugged it back in to see if the miracle of waiting a day would work again... but it didn't. Jumped on Amazon to order a new one and read the review about gunk clogging the propeller and decided to give it one more shot before I ordered a new filter. Took it apart, rinsed it out and plugged it back in and it worked! Saved me $30+.
2498	A classic fantasy novel: I picked up this book in the store out of sheer curiosity, and ended up reading it cover to cover the same day. (I read fast!) I loved the updating of the kids sent away from parents theme and the strong characters, especially Susan. I am glad Dale Peck plans to make this a series - I look forward to the next installment.The main story is set in the Sea of Time - a place outside of our own time boundaries. Murray, the five year old brother, is the first to travel forward in time, and comes back not only changed but with sobering news: Susan is killed in that future. Trying to figure out how to escape from the sea without losing Susan is their first problem - mermaids and pirates give them others. Family and unexpected friendships play an important part in helping them save themselves - and time itself. If you enjoy the Narnia books, give this a try!
2499	Excellent Reference for Programmers: I bought this book with high hopes, and was not disappointed. It is clear, precise and very helpful in providing many algorithms and much needed explanations on calculating ephemerides. However, the calculations for the position of the sun was a little infuriating. I wanted a simple algorithm with less accuracy than suggested by Meeus. By extension, Meeus then refers to the user to other works of even greater accuracy for the calculation of the position of the sun. However, this is a minor point. The book is well-done and is valuable extension to the Astronomical Almanac, and Explanatory Supplement.
2500	Very pretty will definitely get the Wow factor!: The box was a little beat up because the shopper wrapped the box in paper and no box! I don't think it will affect my 3 year old's excitement on Christmas morning, really like the buttons on the carriage and all appears to be working. Merry Christmas! Be blessed!
2501	Give me a break: I guess I was expecting more from this movie considering all the hype I've heard about it. But this movie just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, it was good for a laugh or two but as far as the quality of the movie-it was completely horrible. The special effects looked like they went out and bought some fake body parts from a costume and joke shop, then picked up a few cans of chung-king and there you have it. None of the gore was even remotely realistic. This movie does not even come close in quality of gore or movie making in general to that of DeadAlive, Re-Animator or even Zombie for that matter. I guess Rikki-Oh is a movie you would have to see to believe, but I would see if a friend has a copy or try renting it before you buy. I paid $30 dollars for mine and felt like kicking myself after I saw the movie. It is now just a novelty item in my collection.
2502	Why I didn't like the book!: I thought the vignettes were disjointed. I felt that the book confusing because there were so many different characters and stories. The author could have tied all the stories together at the end to complete the ending.
2503	Don't work for me: I have tried 6 of these so far and have yet to have success. I have tried them on two different burners. Have gone back to using standard DVD's instead. Also, I complained to Amazon about the product and was not happy with the response. They did offer to refund my money, but only if I returned all 10 discs. Well, if I had known none of them were going to work I would have certainly saved them but instead tossed them when they failed.
2504	God Bless South Park: I love the TV series. I love the movie even more. The songs are great, and surprisingly well written (for being trashy cartton movie songs). I saw it in the theater first and laughed through the whole thing. Then I pre-ordered it on DVD. I watch it whenever I need a quick laugh -- it never fails. LOVE this movie. Even though I'm a relatively normal human being.
2505	Great Buy: This is just the item if you do not care about bluetooth. Fast, clear and easy to remove and store away when not in use.
2506	totally as described: i have received the package on time and it was in excellent condition totally as described can't wait to watch the whole saga on my new monster home theater
2507	Darwin would be Proud: This book, written by Henry Morris and Chuckie Darwin, gives new perspective of creationism. The science of intelligent design shows the blueprint used by an "intelligent designer" to create the universe. Periodically, the creatures designed, both evolved and changed. Monkey may or may not have evolved into man. But various creatures have changed as God planned they would. God can make these plans, because ... well, ... He is God!
2508	Works great: Considering this product's low price, I was pleasantly surprised at how well built it is. Has a solid feel, not chintzy at all. Had a little trouble getting it to work on my phone lines, which I assume is because I have DSL service. I had to swap out the DSL line filters until I found one that would not corrupt the caller id signals. (Kept getting an ERROR when the phone would ring.) I took off one star because the display can be hard to read, and there's no backlight. If you get it at just the right angle, it's fine. Otherwise it has insufficient contrast. All in all though, a great little unit at a great price.
2509	Gunga Din: What a movie!!! The greatest adventure movie of all times in my opinion. I can not say how times I've seen it since i was a kid and still love watching it! You're a better man than I am Gunga Din!!!!!!!
2510	INVICTA 8937: Invicta makes a great watch and the 8937 follows suit in great style. Great color combination - gold and blue.
2511	a world of its own: Once again Harry arrives in his second book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry has to escape from his home at the Dursleys and breaks quite a number of magician rules in the process, but fortunately he was able to continue his stay at Hogwart's school for magic. Soon enough weird things start happening around school, all the suspicion falls upon Harry, but Harry and his friends will stop at nothing to find out the truth. Along the way Harry is confronted several times with his ultimate enemy, Draco Malfoy, who will stop at nothing to get the best of the, "so called," famous Harry Potter. This book sets the stand for the Harry Potter books that are yet to come and leaves the reader desperately wanting the next book in this extraordinary series.
2512	Trite and full of cliches: I was disappointed by this book, the first (and last) one I have read by this author. As another reviewer said, there is little to no character development. The protagonist comes off as a shallow whiner who thinks her moronic pithy sayings pass for philosophy. I only finished the book because I paid too much for it On Kindle. I have a hard time knowing how books are priced on Amazon: too often I don't feel I get what I paid for. And then again, I have totally enjoyed older classics and books priced at less than a dollar!Anyway, it's unbelievable that this book got so many 4 and 5 star reviews? Spend your money elsewhere!
2513	Very Good Music... But the European CD issue SUCKS!: The music of this K.T. Tunstall is quite good, genuine and fresh Pop music as it used to be done back in the 70s.However, I got this album as a gift in an European issue... BEWARE!!!!It has that hateful and nasty "COPY CONTROLLED CD" sticker. This means I cannot play the CD in some of my older CD players (portable/car). I don't know if the American issue by Virgin has the same problem, but if it happens I'd rather suggest to buy the downloads from this CDNOW webpage.
2514	A work of art: This film was great! The actors were great and the storyline kept you gripped all the way through it...id advise you all to watch it couse when you have watched it you will want to own it so you can watch it over and over.
2515	If you want nature Docs in HD,, stick with Planet Earth & Galapagos!!: Just saw it,, and it was the worst recent documentary I've seen!!I know polar bears are cute but stick with Galapagos...he'll Planet Earth has better polar bear scenes in a show not sowly focussed on them!I enjoy Queen Letifah but not here..here voice is heartfelt and warm but the other narrations in Galapagos and Planet Earth were soooo much better! I'm sorry,, but any movie that adds fart noises is not a "documentary"!If your expecting Planet Earth or Galapagos PQ then look elsewhere...THis film was fuzzy for the most part,, and probably looked the same as the SD disc. Very Dissapointed,, especially since this is a nature flick.The AQ is also not great,, but most Docs arent due to lack of music as it focuses on the voice of the narrator. But you really cant judge this category without an explosion.Movie: 2/5PQ: 2.5/5AQ: 2/5Overall: 2/5
2516	Can't manually wind it, otherwise nice: This is my 6th Invicta Automatic watch, the last one I purchased was the black faced coin bezel, which is an absolute perfect watch. Somehow this watch lost the ability to be manually wound? (first position out of the screw down should allow it to be wound). Otherwise it is as advertised.I've seen some reviews saying the bracelet is cheap. I own a 2-tone Rolex GMT, and the bracelet weighs about half of this one (the gold links are hollow on that watch), this is a SOLID stainless steel band, and weighs a lot.The time keeping seems as to be expected for a mechanical watch. If your watch gains/loses time, don't throw it away, have the back opened and adjust it (it's a lever inside). Or send it back.
2517	Not my favorite Kaplan book: I have read so many of his books and just wasn't as impressed with this one. It fell a bit flat, in comparison to his older books. Still, a very nice read overall. I was just expecting more.
2518	Choose another book--this one conflicts with moral values: We feel it vital to teach our young children about such topics as soon as they are ready to fully understand them (age 8 in our opinion) and this we have done, but this particular book contains too many conflicting moral issues for us to use as a text to share with our children. A much better choice for our family was "Amazing You" and "Changing You". We had mild differences with these texts, but they proved to be great discussion starters with the children. "What's the Big Secret" went too far across vital moral lines for us to even consider using as discussion material. To each his own, but we wanted to post in case others wanted a heads-up.
2519	Nice product: We have had a few seats now for my 3 year old, who is very tall. Most seats are a little on the high side for her. This one was the perfect size. I like that it was wider too. She doesn't feel that she is too confined.
2520	If you want a cute game for girls, get Mario Kart, not this.: Obviously, this game was made for little girls, but there's better games out there that might appeal to girls without insulting their intelligence.I'm actually exaggerating a bit, this game is not nearly as bad as it could have been. Most of the gameplay is built on riding your horse, which borrows a lot from the Zelda 64 riding engine. Once you get off your horse though to look for runaway horses, watch out. Barbie is slow on her feet and can't run, which can get very annoying. There are also side activities, like unlocking outfits and washing your horse, which is as rudimentary as using the cursor brush to move over a horse.But overall this game sucks. If you want to buy a game for your sister/daughter/niece, get her a real game with quality gameplay, like Mario Kart Double Dash or Super Monkey Ball.
2521	Doesn't Work with Dish Network 301 Receiver: Dish Network uses a proprietary receiver and this remote has no code for that unit. The remote's 'code search' capability cannot find a code for it. Calls to Sony support were worthless; hard to believe Sony isn't familiar with Dish Network, one of the major satelite TV providers.Connects well to the TV, VCR and DVD player, but that does little good when it won't control the reception and channels.Be nice if they'd tell you it doesn't work with Dish Network BEFORE you order it.
2522	Highly Disappointed: This book was highly disappointing. I bought the whole series the other day, because I can read these books in one day. I returned them all. Her story is really slow, it does not catch your attention. On top of that, the grammar is awful. I will never by another book by her.
2523	Really?: Great idea. I was excited how cool it was. The next morning I discovered my fruit on the ground. The basket broke in less than 12 hours! Really???????
2524	Palm Life Drive: I have found the Palm Life Drive to be very handy. I enjoyed using the Treo and wish that this one had a digital camera, it comes in handy often at my work. I haven't had any problems and have found the Life Drive very user-friendly.
2525	Jersey Sally: This book is just plain hateful, mean and nasty. The humor is of South Park IQ level. If you laugh at talking poop, you will probably think this is funny.I'm keeping the book because I enjoy the pictures (that is, the ones that are reasonably well reproduced). Were the 70's tacky? Yes. Were they fun? YES.Lighten up Lileks. It's ok to have fun. What is your decor? Victorian? Now that's laughable!!
2526	Best of All Time: Tight lyrics, phat beats, all-star cast of guest MC's and rappers, exceptional sampled tracks, fabulous production ... this record has it all!!! My pick for best rap album of all time.
2527	Fear and Loathing: Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the best book I've ever read about a drug escapade. Many factors come into play how people don't understand the drug users. A journalist and his attorney set out to cover a race called "The Mint 400" but along the way with unlimited spending power they add to the rental car more than journalist equiptment. They pack the trunk of their rental full of so many drugs that they could keep a small army messed up for awhile. With a great deal of luck and a few close calls the duo made an unsucessful atempt at journalism but a sucessful atempt at findind the American Dream. I highly recomend reading this book.
2528	Warriors all the way: I absolutely loved this movie and the game too. This is for anybody that likes a good old fasioned fist to fist street brawl along with weapons of course.
2529	no problems: no problems, everything arrived on time and in good condition, no errors or breakage contained in the order. Very Good.
2530	Why shave your legs any other way?: Though a little pricey I wouldn't go back to regular razors ever again. This razor makes my legs so incredible soft and silky!! I love that the soap is right there around the blade.
2531	Disappointed in Samsung: Want to watch a movie but don't have time to watch it all at once? Don't buy a Samsung DVD player unless you don't mind leaving the unit on all the time! Turning this player off and back on starts the disc back up at the beginning, forcing you to relocate your spot in the movie.
2532	Simply the Best!: I love the Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator so much that I purchased this one as a backup in case something happens to the one I am curently using. I love how it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, and I know I am doing something really, really good for my teeth and gums. I rate the oral irrigator as 5 stars!
2533	Ahh what happend!!!: Man was I dissapointed when i heard this. I was waiting for another Soul of a new machine but man they really killed it. Were are all thoughs Napalm Deah and Godflesh influnces. Some of the instrumental work on here is good but it sounds radio friendly. I really wish they would of made their last cd a good one. At least they released Concrete which is just full on death metal. I heard Dino was in a different band I wonder what they sound like? I hope like the old FF. Well anyways this was a very dissapoint album and I would not recomend it to the old FF fans.
2534	please send me my Trimmer: I dont know how to rate this item,when i did not recive that.I place that order on Aug 05 2002 and it should have diliver in between Aug 16 2002 to Aug 29 2002 but it has not arrivei dont understant what kind of service you when you dont do your job on time.........................now when you fail to complet my order on time you should send me my trimmer for free of charge or send me some gift for your terrible service.
2535	Stunning CD with great music: This is a great cd! 5 big stars! The import version comes in a pink cardboard box with the CD case inside - or at least the one I have did. ... other companies have released bootleg versions; these are cheaper but don't come in the uber-cool pink box and infringe on copyrights and I do not encourage buying anything but the real import. A nice booklet is included with the CD filled with beautiful pictures from the anime. In addition to the movie soundtrack, there is also a single featuring Masami Okui singing two songs: One from Cyberteam Akihabara - Labyrinth, and the other from Utena - Toki ni Ai wa. There are also karaoke tracks for both songs. Let me say right now that the karaoke versions for both songs is GORGEOUS. Just as gorgeous as the original vocals. This CD is well worth its price, .... Labyrinth is a fast-paced, upbeat song while Toki ni Ai wa... well, you know what it sounds like, don't you! It was released by King Records/Star Child.
2536	Chomp...Drool...Slobber!: My two medium size dogs are insane for these treats! They arrived 2 days ago and were an immediate hit. I believe they like these even better than Pig Ears, and they worship pig ears! These Chik 'n Rings are somewhat small but are easily chewed by the doggies. And they smell good. The dogs perk right up and come running when I take these out of the cupboard. I highly recommend these!
2537	I was very disappointed with this book !: This book was bogus ! The commercial I saw on tv, with the author, who looks like a clown, said that this book contained valuable free things. It is nothing more than a listing of government programs that are very hard to get and have very little to do with free things.
2538	Remembering My Childhood: While reading this book it was as if I was being reminded of my own childhood and how it felt when my parents truly connected with me. Unfortunately, those times of genuine connection were rare. I have worked very hard to heal those old wounds and to move forward in my relationships. On the other hand, as a new parent, I felt that it was in my son's best interest if I dug deeper into my self and experiences in order to provide for him the "best that I can be".This book has been fundamental in this endeavor and I encourage any parent to do the same.
2539	Skip this one: Wished I'd researched this turkey before purchase. If you need to use the terrsin/3D features - you're done for. If you need to design something in real life and you use this program - you're done for.
2540	cute and convenient: i have a couple different sizes of these bowls. these rather small bowls are cute (i have one in red)and the lid is an added bonus. Its a quick prep for small batches of pancake batter (for one child), or if you need to quickly mix baby cereal. You can also use it to store and refridgerate items that would not need to be reheated, such as left over pieces of cake, cold appetizers, or cut up pieces of sandwich. Of course I keep referring to children because it really wont hold an adult portion, unless you would like to keep seperate cut-up veggies in each bowl so that a quick salad would be easy to throw together. Clean up is a breeze; with the smooth curves you get nothing stuck in crevices. Great product. watch the size just to be on the safe side.
2541	This is good. 2008 HHR: I ordered a different company kit first. The metro is a better idea and installed better. The tray is locked on. I liked that. This held a replacement JVC radio with bluetooth for my 2008 Chevy HHR.
2542	NO SPECIAL FEATURES? NOT EVEN A DIGI COPY? That's bull crap!: Seriously... I think it's bull that they do this.Release the movie and then re-release it to get people to buy it a second time.Just wait for the special features DVD pack when it comes out in less than a year.Unless you're a complete movie freak like me... wait and buy it later.I just hope they don't release 16 different versions of it on DVD like they did with Star Wars. I have like 6 trilogies already! What a rip off!
2543	wonderful, sweeping cd that never tires out: I really find this cd to be their best one, even though they are a consistently good band that has many good songs on all of their cds. I am in agreeance with other reviewers, and I add that if you only want one cd by Los Lobos, this is the best one to get (though you would be missing a large amount of good material by limiting yourself to it) thats all!!
2544	What a Disappointment!: Please ignore the "unhelpful" rating given to my review by Turtle Beach employees.When running the driver CD-ROM, no multi-media player is installed, so that means no file types are associated with their software. There is no media library. There is no CD or DVD burning software installed, either.This is just a bare-bones sound card, folks. That's it and nothing else.So what DO you get? Dolby Digital Live (DDL) 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound. This is a great feature if you have multi-channel speakers. If you don't, this product is a waste of your money.Regardless of what audio hardware a buyer may or may not have, I still think it's a waste of money, anyway. For a little more cash here at Amazon, everything this card has plus a whole lot more--including Dolby Digital Live--is available from any Creative Labs Titanium-series board. (And I'm not a Creative Labs employee.)
2545	An extremely good choice for the money.: These are very good knives for every day use at an excellent price.
2546	The best baseball movie ever made: Troubled farmer Ray Kinsella(Kevin Costner..who has never been better) keeps hearing voices telling him, of all things, to build a baseball field in his back yard! Far-fetched? sure, but few movies combine fantasy and emotion as well as this one. The voices and visions continue until Kinsella takes a field trip to team up with a well known author(wonderfully portrayed by James Earl Jones) the skepticism resides and the two take a magical journey that will change their lives forever. I will tell no more, it would be a sin. Grown men be warned however, if any movie is sure to bring a tear to your eye, it's this one.
2547	Great Book (Not for Beginners): I'm in the middle of reading this book and it is AWESOME. Gott does a great job writing and addresses both visual and non-visual learners. I would recommend it for anyone interested in physics and/or astronomy. Even half way through I understand much more than I did before starting. I'm in fifth grade and nobody but me in my class understands it (but, as you probably know, I'm not the average fifth grader). It is the best non-fiction book I've ever read and I hope you read it too!
2548	Makes sweeping fun: I was hesitant to order the auto dustpan, but 2 shedding dogs and a large tiled area made me decide to give it a try. I've had the dustpan about 2 months and it has worked well. Even the fly-away dog hair is sucked up efficiently. The only problem I've found is that sometimes the dustpan doesn't automatically turn on when I bring the broom close to the sensors. Not really a problem since all I have to do is give the large button a light tap with my foot and the dustpan begins inhaling the debris immediately. It then automatically turns off 5 seconds later without any other actions required.
2549	Must have for cinnamon lovers!: I absolutely love this tea!It has a wonderful flavor, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it steeps strong. Strong enough that I can make a 16oz. cup with one bag, versus having to use two bags as with some of Celestial's other flavors.And if you're looking for even more kick, add a little honey - it intensifies the cinnamon even more!
2550	Naive Nine: Someone buy nine copies of this book and send it to those clueless Dems running for president. I don't care for Dubya one little bit . . . but I wouldn't trust the Oval Office to any of these losers. Aren't there other options? Hopefully one of the Naive Nine, as Zell calls them, will read this book and wise up to the cares and concerns of the people who actually vote in their party in places other than New York City and Los Angeles.
2551	One of my favorite John Wayne movies.: I bought this movie thinking I would be able to watch it off line on an airplane. Well, apparently Amazon won't let you download a movie that you "own". I love this movie but I'm disappointed that I waisted my money on Amazon. I was able to download it from iTunes, but I had to purchase third party software to convert it so that it would play on my android device.
2552	Sunbeam Mixmaster Stand Mixer, Chrome: I was disappointed in this mixer after having used Sunbeam mixers throughout my 45 year marriage. I use a mixer frequently and want one that has a detached head. Hand mixers are not powerful enough for my needs.This mixer was plastic. The bowls required twisting into holding slots. The beaters were similar to hand mixer beaters--not heavy duty. I returned the mixer, had my old one repaired, and bought a 1980 model on e-bay to keep as a spare.
2553	ARMY OF DARKNESS: Is the worst in the series, but this one is very good. The dvd isnt good, bcause it have only the trailer....BUY IT NOW!!
2554	Charmed, The Final Season: The price is great. I love being able to find what I need without having to go from store to store. Purchased as a gift and loved by the recipient.
2555	NBA Street is a great game!: If you're looking for a good simulation basketball game, I recomend that you don't by this game. But if you're looking for a great arcade style basketball game, I recomend that you buy this game! It's one of the best arcade basketball games ever made! The seaqual is out to this game, but the first version is also very good! The only problem with it is that you can't play on teams and you can only play with 1 other player including yourself. Other than that, it is a great game! Buy it now! it's at a low price!
2556	Great printer for the Price: I've owned this printer for a week and am very pleased. It's a great Printer for the price. It's well constructed, fast and simple to use.I share it on a home network with PCs running Win95, Win98 and WinXP. No problems printing. The driver provides access to all the printer's features on these platforms and is very straight forward.I considered the HP 1200 and Brother 1450. I normally purchase HP printers but was disappointed in how flimsy the HP appeared. While I wouldn't mind Postscript which comes with the HP, it isn't essential and not worth the additional $$. The Brother was probably my second choice, but the Samsung had better specs and was less expensive.The Samsung WEB site could be improved, but I was able to eventualy validate that the drivers that came with the printer were up to date. They also have limited service coverage.
2557	crass: One would have thought that three excellent writers combined are able to come up with something that is at least average! But this book is beyond that... Predictable plotlines, shallow characters and the standart ending are still the better part. Nevertheless that I can hardly stand the way how the characters are divided into two groups...good and evil...with the evil mage to pleat the case. But the book is not totally beyond help...I rather liked the idea of the story.. but the way it has worked out...if you love tastless, predictable romance... enjoy!
2558	hurts my ears: these earrings are too small, smaller than what i thought. they look nice when i put them on but i cant wear them too long because they hurt the back of my ears. waste of money....
2559	DON'T DO IT!!: OK, this games is perhaps the worst game I have ever played...JUST HIT THE BACK BUTTON AND SLOWLY WALK AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER. Yes, it is that bad.
2560	Very upset with techniques: I bought this book as a gift for my sister who just acquired a rescue blind puppy.I'm a positive dog trainer and was disgusted that a prong collar could be suggested for any dog, let alone a traumatised blind dog! These are illegal in Australia. I couldn't believe my eyes and had to re-read it, as I thought I must have read it wrong. And to say that this method is not as harsh as some others, the mind boggles to think what these alternatives are! To suggest a water spray for blind and deaf dogs is just disgusting. These are both cruel methods which are just so unnesessary, when the desired behaviors could be achieved by gentle kind methods.How very disapointing.
2561	Miracles Happen!!!: Great book! Great advice! For anyone who is healthy or sick. Miracles can happen and life can be great, examples like Naomi Judd prove it! Try it for yourself and see!
2562	Invicta Automatic Watch: Beautiful timepiece. Great quality. This is the perfect choice for a great gift. You can't go wrong. I recommend this watch to everyone.
2563	Sent back: I love LeCreuset, and was excited to see the price on this little gem. However, the first one I ordered was severely scratched. I returned it, and the second one I received had the handle mounted sideways!! I don't know if there was a load of seconds, but I will wait awhile before ordering anymore.
2564	Vic Firth Jazz Rakes: they would be okay if they were two dollars a piece... disposable!: Vic Firth Jazz RakesGreat sound for the music I do (soft jazzy rock)... but very poor contruction. I had a pair for a few months and they are almost gone. The soft rubber where the handle meets the bristles has cracked on both brushes and I've already lost a few bristles. If you consider that I've used these brushes sparingly and on congas, bongos and cymbals (on "soft" stuff that is, with no nasty rims to contend with), it is obvious that this product needs to be better manufactured. Let me guess... built in China?
2565	One Great Laptop Backpack: I recently purchased two laptop backpacks and a leather laptop portfolio/briefcase. All three were Swiss Army, not certain if all were Wenger. Although the portfolio was top of the line I discovered that the backpack was a better way to go so I returned the portfolio.Of the two backpacks the MAXXUM is the one I selected for everyday use. It does a wonderful job. My office is on the fourth floor and I take the stairs up instead of the elevator. The backpack is definitely better. Since I live in Florida I really appreciate the way the padding can breathe and the suspension system relieves much of the stress.I would recommend this to anyone with or without a laptop.
2566	Shorted out my computer: The title says it all. This thing is not well constructed and when plugged into my power system (it plugs into a four pin connector) it shorted out the system. The behavior was repeatable. I very much recommend you look for a different product.
2567	wonderful........one her best!: I loved Sandra Brown the Alibi. It was one of her best. But it does not top the trilogy of Texas!Lucky, Texas!Chase, Texas!Sage, now those are her best work. It would be terrible if there was not another book to follow.
2568	It's more like Robert J. Grant on Angels, Archangels, and the Unseen Forces than Cayce: I have read a lot of cayce and there is many part of the book thatdoesn't ring right! it is all open to interpretations.Other than that it was interesting in some areas.Blavatsky needs definitely a closer look...after much reading I find Steiner to be good but the other oneis definitely another story. it is a personal journeyso get the book and find out for yourself.Be good my friends
2569	Great Collection!: Overall, a solid collection of synthpop songs that fit nicely in the club music genre. I must disagree with the "one star rating". This is not cheesy music. It is of very high quality sound and composition...but obviously not for the masses. If it was, A Different Drum would be licensing some of the "Club Anthem Junk" that abounds at your local music store. Although I don't enjoy every track here (Mesh & System 22), and feel a better title would have suited this release (Club Anthem speaks of something completely different to me such as those repetitive-style dance mixes of old Whiteney Houston and Bonnie Tyler songs that show up on "Thunderpuss" & "Club 69" compilations), I highly recommend it. Wave In Head, Echo Image, Sweep, Moulin Noir are worth the price of entry alone. And rest assured, you won't hear this music when you get your haircut in the mall next time :)
2570	If you want interesting music try Tool or Alice In Chains: No this album isnt 1 star. Yes practically every radiohead fan in the world has rated this album 5 star. No i dont like this style of music. Yes my two favorite bands are Alice In Chains and Tool. Yes Tool is also overrated. Yes they deserve to be. No radiohead does NOT deserve to be. Yes Radiohead are a pretentious band. No Tool are not a pretentious band. Therefore TOOL and ALICE IN CHAINS are better than Radiohead.
2571	Cool: Now this is what you call Music real cool gospel R/B feeling music now this is what I'am talking about
2572	TV show without commercials: The 3D effects were average, but the biggest dissapointment to me was that it seemed like a television documentary with the commercials removed.
2573	DeLonghi filters: Not much to say -- they fit and they work.The filtration isn't magical -- lots of greasy aromas escape.
2574	WRONG description: Amazon refuses to correct this ad, the cost is PER FOOT, not for a full roll. MacLendons gets calls 3 times day about these orders, was fully apologetic and encouraged me to complain to Amazon to fix the ad and use the correct description. They also offered a full refund.
2575	ball not round: I ordered this ball so my children can play kickball with their friends in the neighborhood. When it arrived, we inflated it and it was OVAL not round. ? You got me. Never saw an oval playground ball in my life. We deflated and carefully inflated again, the ball was still OVAL. I had to make contact with the company three times to get a response. When I did, they said they couldn't replace it, but they did quickly send me a refund. Waste of time.
2576	Very Disappointed: As a fellow quote collector, I have bought nearly every quote book I have ever run across. This is literally the first quote book I have ever seen with hundreds of quotations that do not list the author of the quote...not exactly what most quote lovers are looking for.I did give the book an extra star because I enjoyed the table of contents that seperated the quotes by categories, which most quote books do not do. There are plenty of good quotes in here, but I would advise customers to take advantage of the "Search Inside" function on Amazon to make sure that this book is the kind of quote book they are looking for.
2577	really good information: This book really made sense to me and I enjoyed reading about each love language and figuring out which one I was and which one my husband was. It is great information to have, but it doesn't mean it is magically easy to apply to your life- but a great start! I think everyone- married or not- should read this! Why don't they teach THIS stuff in school?!?
2578	Still in Love with Paulina: (From back cover) Rutger Hauer stars as small-town detective Reardon, a once-disgraced policeman who is assigned to work on a high-profile kidnapping case reporting to a decorated FBI agent, Wallis (Paulina Porizkova), who as luck would have it, happens to be his ex-wife. The clues of the case lead nowhere and tensions mount, until a surprise break fingers a suspect - Reardon! As the victim's body is discovered, the hunter becomes the hunted and Reardon and Wallis must pull out all the stops to prove his innocence and find the real killer.This is a better than average straight to video movie. The suspense is constant and the editing is above par. Of course Paulina looks better than ever and is starting to become quite an actress.
2579	Great mat but too slippery.: Excellent yoga mat with a beautiful array of colors. I purchased this mat for studio practice and felt nervous the entire time. It is thicker and longer but because it is slippery it is pretty much useless to me. I don't plan on purchasing ToeSox or grippy gloves but I would need to if I continued to use this mat.Time to splurge on a Manduka.
2580	A very good classic dictionary: Noah Webster's 1828 American Dictionary is a very good classic dictionarythat gives definitions to some words you won't find in the Oxford EnglishDictionary. It is well worth it!
2581	Space, 3D, Blue-Ray: Purchased along with Flight DVD. Nothing more to add to excellence! Any one of any age will benefit from this video. Good investment for entire family
2582	Atlantis Action makes for exciting reading!: Bob Mayer continues his exciting Atlantis storyline with this second book (of six) in this thrilling series. I gave the first book 5 stars and ditto for the 2nd. Bob piles on the suspense and I just wanted to read faster & faster so I could find out how it all came out in the end. No 2nd book letdown here at all. If anything, I am more determined than ever to continue reading this series. I have the 3rd book already on my Kindle and can't wait to get around to reading it (ATLANTIS: DEVIL'S SEA). As I mentioned in one of my reviews, I have read several Bob Mayer books and I have really enjoyed them all. A thrill a minute, plenty of action, hi-tech gadgets, a great cast of characters, solid writing, and on and on.
2583	Not worth it: When the sound getting through is the same if the power is on or off, what does that tell you? It means that the "active" portion is a hoax. Only reduction came from something covering my ears. Also not very comfortable. Couldn't use them on a long flight.
2584	Excellent saw-very pleased: My first reciprocating saw...and a dandy for the average handyman who has often scratched his head and knuckles trying to figure out how in the world to make a particular cut. The Dewalt is sturdy, if a bit heavy. The power is adequate for everything I've encountered so far...wood, steel, etc. Nothing cleaver to learn how to use, no wrenches or screws to misplace when changing blades, just straightforward cutting. the drop-in blade clamp is simple and effective. It makes changing blades fast and certain. Dewalt only send one blade with the saw and it's a metal cutting blade, so to keep up with chores involving wood, you need to pick-up a variety pack of blades at the local hardware store. This saw is everything I would expect.
2585	Very entertaining for upper elementary school age children.: This book offered a wide variety of mind provoking elements. I enjoyed the magicial content of the chocolate factory. This book was very entertaining and would allow young children to enter the world of fantasy through Charlie.
2586	Might as well save your $20 for a few beers.: If you're in the self-help section, and have already exhausted your traditional avenues of help (friends, family, social groups, church, etc.) do you really believe a puffed-up infomercial will have answers for you?
2587	sonic adventure 2: this game is awesome theres sonic shadow tails amy knuckles all them and the chao garden is awesome its the best
2588	Horrible range!: This item does work and open my garage door (that's why it gets 2 stars) but I have to be standing next to my garage for it to work! I have other openers that can open my garage from 2 houses down on the street yet can't be more then 15 feet away! Would not recommend this opener.
2589	Some of my favorite Ohgr yet!: Ohgr and Atkins surely work well together. With an acoustic intro, followed up by dark industrial masterpieces, this CD will have you hooked in no time. I thought Crackhead Walz was annoying, and The Daze repetitive and boring, but the other songs were fantastic. The only other quip I can give here is that the CD is rather short, which makes the good sounds stop too soon.
2590	TOO LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: When I first saw this controler i said "gee it sure looks comfortable" But when I started playing Wave Race BS. I only said 2 words"too little" . Hopefully this will change with 3rd party controllers. By the way Xbox's controller feels much more comfortable.
2591	For Clive Barker completists: If you're a maniacal fan of the Hellraiser series, you may find these two short films interesting for historical reasons, since they include some of the actors and themes that turn up in Barker's more professional later films. There are also a couple of interviews which enlighten us (sort of) on what the films are supposed to be about! The adjective "murky" (in more ways than one) best describes these fuzzy 8-mm efforts. Not being, I confess, a big Hellraiser fan, I found my primary emotion to be not horror but boredom.
2592	None of this garbage worked! Save your hard-earned cash!: I was truly dissapointed with this book. Not only did it have absolutely NO results, I threw $12 right out the window! If you want real magic, try "Voodoo, Spells, Incantations, Potions, and other works of Magick, both Good and Evil". That book had it goin' on. But this? There aren't words to describe it's lack of effectivness. (P.S.: This book got 1 star from me because Amazon doesn't have a lower rating available.)
2593	A fun book by an author who knows his stuff.: My good friend Pat Horan knows a lot about his subject matter--he spent time in the US Army as a Ranger and took part in the invasion of Panama. This book uses his background and personal experience as the foundation for the story of two lovers whose Carribbean vacation is interrupted by political turmoil and a Grenada-esque U.S. invasion. If you are a fan of military fiction (with a little romance blended in), you'll love this book! The main character's dream sequences are particularly enjoyable, especially his recollections of boot camp.
2594	OK looking shoe but way oversize.: A 10 fits like a 11 or larger but a 9 might be to short if you are a 10?????
2595	Simply amazing.: Great compositions. The piano is so moving with a beatiful flute and violin to accent the mood. The ocean sounds are gentle and soothing and don't get in the way of the music. If anything they amplify the relaxing quality of the album. As a pianist ... I can say that the pianist behind this music is amazing. He really puts emotion into his music. You feel as though your with him on the ocean shore or on a journey to a magical place filled with beautiful music. I don't want to sound "cheesy," so I'll simply tell you to check it out for yourself. A definite recommendation for any avid fan of new age piano music.
2596	Awful... useless... one of the worst movies ever!: I could not believe it. This os simply one of the worst movies ever. IT's cheap, sickening, useless. IT does not serve even as mindless fun. evn if your turn off your brain, your senses will alert you how the intentions of the producers are fake, from the absurd lack of lightning (where you can't see the fights), to fast editing, through horrible "acting" and obnoxious directing (by two guys!)It's onet of the worst movies ever, where producers thought: "This is trash, but some people will enjoy it". It's the worst that Hollywwod can offer.Yes, I'm a sucker, because I've watched it. I did not even rent it, or downloaded it, I BOUGHT the DVD! (because, believe it or not, I thought the fist movies, although completely unecessary and forgettable twenty minutes after leaving the theater, an enjoyable one).
2597	The Ward Cleaver approach to teaching: If you want the symopsis of this book... here it is in 2 words:Think Positive!If you are unable to do that, then this book is not for you.This book is written as if it were by Ward or June Cleaver. I kept expecting Eddie Haskell to but in and tell me how nice I looked today.Not a bad book. Common sense positive thinking.
2598	Van Wailin': As a fan of DLR and VH since day one, and a banjo player for the last 15 years, I really wanted to like this album, but it doesn't flow at all; it sounds forced. I'm not one of those "that ain't how Bill/Earl/Ralph played it" types, but if you want super hot bluegrass covers, check out Newgrass Revival doing the Beatles, Run C&W doing Motown, Hayseed Dixie doing AC/DC/LedZep. They sound like they mean what they're picking; this album sounds like someone's looking for another payday.
2599	uncomfortable: i purchased this pump and for me it was very uncomfortable (my nipples are too big i guess?)i ended up throwing it away and kept the Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump which came with two sizes and i could pump with one hand and feed my daughter on the other side at the same time
2600	Delicious: I really enjoyed trying this product. I give it two thumbs up. The taste was very rich and creamy. I would recommend it to anyone.
2601	Ear Piercing: The drive has great capacity and works fast enough. However, after seeking it makes a very high pitched noise. It is not even that loud and yet I can't stand it at all. Would not recommend based on this if you have any kind of sensitive hearing. Additionally the drive has no means to set it to run slower but with less noise unlike other drives.
2602	The sweet spot of Comic Book Cartoons: I am reminded of the TV shows, both live action and Saturday morning, that were never this good. If you take your comic book characters too seriously then this is not your show. Stylistically the animation is excellent with crisp and heavy line work. The four color heroes just pop from the screen. The stories are self contained and just fun. This episode focuses on the trinity (Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman) and their signature villains. You can watch this with the kids and still feel like a kid. This is for anyone who ever ever tied a towel around their shoulders, pretended to block bullets with their wrist bands or mimed the act of climbing the side of a building. Just great.
2603	Where's my money?: This movie had so many advertisements shoved down my throat that I feel I should have been paid to watch it. Combined with the lame humor and poor story line, I'm going to have to borrow some more thumbs to point down.
2604	Universal Search for Meaning: An Infinity of Little Hours is a facinating look inside another world. Because my husband and I are not Catholics, we not only learned about the lives of the Carthusian monks, but also expanded our understanding of Catholicism. A very enjoyable book that brings the universal search for meaning into sharp focus.
2605	Classic Waltons: What else can you say except an eceptional and traditional story about Thanksgiving and family. A great one to watch with the entire family every Thanksgiving and throughout the year.
2606	Too much missing from a great HK film: Although a great mix of action and drama, this movie made in the mid-80s, which has recently seen the light of day in the states, is missing too much. This movie is missing about 2 fight scenes that add nearly 10 minutes. Two fight scenes mean too much missing. Some of the action in the finale was deleted also. Where would a Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Hong Kong action film be without numerous fight scenes? Some of the music has been changed or taken out that enhanced the mood of the scenes. I am a great fan of Jackie Chan and Hong Kong cinema but I am tired of seeing fantastic action films cut of their action. This movie would have been 5 stars had it not had too much missing.
2607	great guy: Love this CD. I play it all the time. Would love to see him in concert. I wouldn't have found this CD if it wasn't for your tube
2608	This review is on the song, not the other 2 songs.: This is one of the coolest songs I've ever heard. There is a real swampy kind of sound to it, and PJ Harvey's voice is really hypnotic. Unlike a lot of bands now who mesh chords together to make a 'song,' this has a unique melody with an Eastern-tinge to it. Good song, I plan to check out Desert Sessions soon.
2609	Causes Cricket Death?: I ordered this product based on some recommendations from breeders/owners. Half of my crickets were dead the next day. They had appropriate water and supposedly this should be enough to keep them alive for at least a couple days; since everything I read talked about gut-loading for at least 24 hours with this product. I thought maybe it was a fluke (oh so punny!), so I purchased another batch of crickets and the same thing happened. I cleaned out the keeper and I switched to the orange cubes, which I "float" in the SoBe caps I use for the water dishes -- keeps crickets from drowning and keeps the cubes moist, and haven't had any problems since I started keeping the Hi Calcium product OUT of the keeper. Perhaps I have a bum batch? At any rate, I have an entire jar of this product with no intentions of using it again. I'll stick to the cubes.
2610	could be better so much better: I bought this pillow bc I really didn't see one really bad review on it. When I got it I was so happy, but than came putting the pillow covers on which was not fun or easy by any means. But with the pillow covers on, it makes the pillow shorter, which if your a long tall person, its hard to stretch out and even be in it at all. So I just took the covers off completely, which gave me more room. But the main problem was the pillow for your head was the same thickening as the other side which make your head sit up too high, and made my neck hurt. If the pillow on one side was not as thick where my head could lay and be even with my spine, I would be more than pleased. So that's how I feel about it all. Now the pillow sits on the floor next to me, I'm hoping I can find another use for it, since I put so much money into it.
2611	Douglas Who?: Dandelion Wine has been in my personal top 3 ever since I first read it for a sophomore lit course in 1982. Although the afterword of Farewell to Summer asserts that both novels were born of one draft, the original characters are recognizable only in brief flickers. Douglas Spaulding, in particular, in a matter of supposed mere days or weeks between the end of the first novel and the beginning of the next, has inexplicably morphed from the pensive, sensitive everyboy into the wannabe leader of a small-town terrorist cell. Yes, Bradbury remains ever the wordsmith, but this was just a bummer - too dark and too bizarre in comparison to the original. I almost wish I hadn't read it at all.
2612	I returned mine: I did not care for it either because the maps were outdated. Bought my unit from Costco and took advantage of the return policy. When asking for the closest walmart it said it was in another state! Although I know how close my local one is. And there are many similar examples. That is the main reason I returned it. Also when you take a wrong turn it takes it a while to figure out where you are and to reroute you often making you panic when on the road bc you are not sure which way to turn in the meantime.
2613	This book is really for DUMMIES: This book is basically a high-level, marketing-oriented white paper. I don't think anybody should pay for this kind of stuff. If you want to impress your colleagues with SAP's Enterprise Services Architecture (ESA), it's OK to read it. It's SAP's blueprint for the future. If you are a technical person and wants to learn something useful, this is a waste money.
2614	Great reference to have around!: Although you won't be able to play exactly like Jake, some of the lessons he provides can help anyone's personal playing style. If you're willing to put in the practice and time, you can play in a whole new way on the uke!
2615	very disappointing: My daughter's grandparents bought this for her when she was about 4 mo old. The keys are very hard to push and it didn't hold the interest of my daughter for more than about 2 minutes. It drains batteries very quickly and now it doesn't even make the sound it is supposed to . It sounds like it had a meltdown. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I, as was my daughter, was very disappointed.
2616	disappointed: I had a Sharp Carousel microwave purchased in 1993. It died a slow death, and then finally in July of 2011 it died for good. I replaced it with this model. The pre set buttons were not as good as the original. I preferred the preset time to the sensory cooking which wasn't as accurate. There were so many more steps to using the buttons that I found it easier to just punch in a time and let it go. So after 14 months of use I was just getting used to the "new" machine, and now I don't have to worry about it because it died. Now I did not expect it to last as long as my original model, but 14 months?? Very disappointed. Also, I don't know what to buy now. I always liked my Sharp better than anyone elses microwave, and now I don't feel as if I can trust them.
2617	Book purchase review: The book arrived promptly and was in great shape. Why this review requires a certain number of words in order to post it is ridiculous.
2618	Yikes! Clown Hair: Followed instructions; applied product; hope was high for the perfect color. After one hour it was clown red and seemed that the product had stopped working.It was a weekend. Clairol wasn't open so I waited two days wearing clown red hair to call and or email the help desk. They told me that had I left it on 90 minutes the red would have gone away.Let's just say my opinion is inconclusive at this point, but doubt I'll use it again.
2619	All in all they're just another brick in the wall: Zero Stars would be appropriate. Many of the folks who have spent their money on this are obviously interested in validating their purchase, which is fine. However, what it comes down to is this: does this CD contain anything worth buying? wise fans opinion, NO. Brianwashed posers whom try to be cool among their classmates, YES.This was the most horrendous U2 album I had ever heard! I apologized to my poor ears for putting them through the grief of listening to it. Really devoid of substance. Music is so lame and repetitive. It's ALL about the fashioned and overhyped name U2. Even critics seem to be brianless when they pushed this piece of crap forward. Bono can't sing, period.Please stop supporting this corporation. U2 2000 exemplifies how superficial and empty music has become.[...]
2620	Good oil: I am sadden that I purchased this product from Amazon.com, when I found this product at my local grocer for cheaper. The oil has a woodsy smell but its bareable, I have noticed a difference in my hair, no more shedding and it is much stronger.
2621	Does not fit 3/8" dovetail: I should have heeded the other reviews. Although a very nice sight, it is too big to grasp a 3/8" dovetail.I purchased a Crosman 2240, added an extended barrel, modified bolt and a steel breech but can not use it because the red-dot sight would not mate to the 3/8" dovetail on the Crosman breech. I am very disappointed.The sight is on it's way back to Amazon.
2622	DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE: THIS IS NOT A COMEDY, IT IS A WARPED MOVIE THAT MADE ME HAVE NIGHTMARES. I REITERATE: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.
2623	stop......major boredom ahead: I have just started reading the book and already im wishing i never picked it up. I cant believe English teachers could make their students read such a boring book. Kingston completely distorts all of the myths that belong to the chinese culture. I can't believe a member of the chinese culture could change facts around and make interesting, wonderful myths of the chinese culture seem almost ugly. It almost like she is try to hard to show the bads things of her culture
2624	This Book is Alright: Being an avid reader of Event Planning literature, I must say that this book is alright.
2625	Sweet game: This game is amazing and I love this game, and not one of my friends hasn't loved the game we spent 4 days straight playing this game it's just that fun. If any of you didn't know it was rated 4th for overall multiplayer of the year. It's graphics are really good and the moves you can perform are awesome, you can jump over a sword that's in mid swing and nail an oppenent without touching the ground first (once you get good enough). I suggest checking out this game all my friends are trying to find a PS2 copy, but untill then we just have a greate time playing my gamecube copy.
2626	Burns' best: In my opinion, this is Burns' best all around production among ALL of his projects to date.
2627	Good for a few meals only: I guess the great reviews on this product were made by people who used it once or twice. They were so thrilled with it they wrote a good review soon after getting it. However, if you use it on a regular basis problems quickly show up: (1) the non-stick surface comes off quickly resulting in (2)lots of scrubbing and clean-up (3)the unit heats unevenly and (3)it doesn't drain much fat at all not to mention it is (5) tiny!! Someone who plans to use it once a month may like it. Otherwise it is a waste of money.
2628	Avoid "enhanced" cds: The "Black Cadillac" cd by Rosanne Cash is exceptionally beautiful. But, the "enhanced version" I mistakenlyordered doesn't play on my regular cd player and onlyplays the audio on my dvd player. It will play onmy computer, but that's not what I expected.Be prepared to make a cd version by rip and burn if youwant to play this wonderful cd on your primary stereosystem.
2629	mottled blue marbles: These do not have any kind of earth design on them. Just mottled blue marbles.Perhaps ok for the price but not as expected
2630	Buyer Beware!: This is (contrary to popular opinion) a very interesting book about system development methodology -- well thought out and clear. However, the subject matter has almost nothing at all in common with the 70-100 exam. This book addresses high level methodology, but the exam covers lower level technologies such as data and process modeling, and "extracting" simple requirements from complex prose. The title of this book is exceedingly misleading. Buyer beware!
2631	it works: actually this was a gift from my sister i didn't follow the instructions. i actually apply it when ever i feel like it including before bed time. i am using this product for over a week and i am noticing a very big difference in my lashes length. the only problem is that my right eye respond more clearly than the other one but i think this is only me not the product.
2632	Moronic movie that could have been very good: Some of the interview subjects in this movie are interesting individuals, others self-absorbed adolescents, but Ms. Arquette is essentially inarticulate and doesn't seem to know how to conduct an intelligent interview. Her interview subjects offer some interesting insights, especially into just how shallow some of them are, but Arquette isn't responsible for drawing them out. The interviewees present their views mostly well in spite of Arquette's ineptitude as an interviewer. Most often her "questions" aren't really questions at all, but rather range from sycophantic exclamations to inane observations about herself.Avoid this turkey.
2633	lid doesn't stay on: What a bunch of crap. We only use this as a bucket to carry the shapes in. The lid does NOT stay on, doesn't snap in, ANYTHING. I would not waste my energy even clicking the "purchase" button for this.
2634	Inaccurate, flimsy - stay away: I tested it with 6 strips, everytime it showed over 330. Finally i went to the lab and got it tested - my total cholestrol was 190! Even on the day I went to lab i tested with the last strip and it showed 337 - This is a highly inaccurate instrument - stay away from it. Also, the front panel (with cardiochek logo) comes of easily - flimsy design.
2635	Disappointing: Pullman creates a believable world in his first few chapters and I enjoyed reading that part of the book. I felt that he had a jumble of good ideas and tried to throw them all in at once. In the end I was confused and while I didn't want to give up in the central character and her bear I ended up finishing the book dissatisfied. Perhaps others will like it more; perhaps I read it too quick.
2636	doll house furniture: Got several sets of M & D doll house furniture for my daughter to use with her M & D doll house. good quality, scale is great, they fit right in.
2637	Why does everything have to be so damn hard?: David Hasselhoff is a big singing star in Germany, but this is one of the few albums that he actually released in America. Listening to it, it's not surprising that he never made it as a singer in America. This is a very bad "soft rock" type album. The albums opens with a cover of the Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds hit "Fallin' in Love", and it's all downhill from there. The rest of the songs are all originals, and none of them are very good. As for Hasselhoff's singing, he is not awful, but he's not that great, either. But if you live in Germany, you will probably love this album.
2638	a short review for ppl who don't want to read long ones: This movie is very good. I'm 16 and a fan of Gregory Peck and I loved this movie. I recommend the book first because this movie cannot even compare to the novel. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best books I've ever read. I don't think my entire english class has ever agreed on loving a book that was an assignment.
2639	Total Garbage: This guy has an axe to grind (but without a true cause) and his outlook on the mormon church is CLEARLY askew. I am a lifelong catholic and have lived near 2 Mormon families for most of my life. We have talked at length regarding their views several times since I have known them and I can tell you this: Mr. Bennett's opinions (though he states them as fact), could not be further from the truth. Did you get your poor feelings hurt by a mormon Mr. Bennett?... or were you just interested in making a dishonest buck?If you want to know what a mormon really believes you could just ask one of them. As in all religions, I'm sure you have good mormons and bad ones, but generally I have found that they are extremely kind and genuine group of Christian people. And their beliefs are NOT as Bennett says they are.
2640	Disgusting!: I always loved the Grimm's Fairy tales, and hoped to find a movie with a little old world charm. This is not what I was looking for at all. Without going into detail, I am maybe halfway through the film and there have already been some very disgusting segments. I would not show this to anyone... It is degrading to watch, in my opinion.
2641	It's growing on me!: I loved "Mud on the Tires" so much I was a little disappointed when I first listened to this album. But over time, I'm really coming to appreciate it. I really enjoy the way Paisley writes music -- there's usually some surprise embedded in the song, whether it's in the words or the music. He doesn't go for the easy cliche' very often, which is something that bothers me about other country music.My favorite track on this album is "Rainin' You' - he delivers it with such a personal, understated approach that I can really feel the bittersweet misery of the "narrator." I could do without "Cornography," though! Replace it with another good, solid song!
2642	sophmore album, but probably his greatest achievment: the soft fingerpicked guitar at the beginning of introduction just gets you into this masterwork of an album. nick draakes second album is considered to be his masterpiece, and rightfully so. it is definetly his most up beat album, but thats to nick drakes standards. the album is full of beautiful poetry, nicks humble fingerpicked guitar playing, lush instrumentation, and even horns. northern sky, fly, and hazey jane 1 are probably 3 of the greatest songs ever written by anyone. if you are new to nick, this should be the second album you pick up, after pink moon. but all three of his albums should be in everyones colection
2643	Damodaran study guide - old edition: Don't think I will use this book. It's an old study guide from 1994.Damodaran on Valuation, Study Guide: Security Analysis for Investment and Corporate Finance (Wiley Professional Banking and Finance)
2644	Not My Style of Chai: I love Celestial Seasonings chai tea. But this stuff is nothing like it.It;s a much blander, yet more bitter taste. Might be ok with plenty of milk and sweetener, but if you like to drink your chai tea straight, then avoid.
2645	A REAL WINNER: This Tool is a must for any handyman or carpenter.This thing is bomb proof. I used it for a recent roof job and, it fell 30' on more than one occasion, (it just bounced) so dont worry about breaking it.The old aluminum style would not have done so well. This thing winds up in a hurry and even un-winds quickly thanks to the clutch. Just press in on the handle and it pays out the line without the handle whirling around, a real neat trick.In my opinion this tool is top notch and , I do recommend it to anyoneNow get out there and snap some lines.
2646	Works great: Great antenna! Depending on where you live, you might not even need to pull the dipoles (rabbit ears) out, at all. The UHF antenna (the main, funky looking one) is very directional and gets great reception. If you can't pick it up with this, you can't pick it up with any indoor antenna and will have to look for outdoor options!The only downside is that it's a little bit bigger than expected, and doesn't balance well on carpeted floors. Cable management is also not ideal. All over-the-air antennas are a little ugly/tacky/cumbersome, but this is probably the best you're gonna find!
2647	Awesome Grill: The grill works really well. I like the fact that it cleans easily. The bread cooks evenly.I would buy one again.
2648	Why dont you ship outside the US???: I would love to give it five stars if I could only play it and to play it I must buy it and I want to buy it butfor some reason you dont want to ship it to South Africa and you dont get this game in South Africa!I always bought my Deer Hunter games here but for the last few months you wont ship me the games outside the US.Please look in to the needs of all other customers outside the US!!!!!Thank you...
2649	???: I haven't received my item yet. It's been more than a month, and though I've been in contact with the owner I still haven't received anything.
2650	Johnny now and 4ever!: Wow! JTHM was truly a work of art. Once u pick it up u won't be able to put it down. Jhonen Vasquez was a pure genius with this book. He blended the seriousness of Johnny with humor and killing. But that's what Johnny is all about.The illustrations are excellent and the plot superb. There's no focus on the killing, but also not on Johnny's problems. It mixes well together and the characters are great. If you are debating on Squee or JTHM, get both, but JTHM first!
2651	Boo.: Ugh. What was this? What a trashy movie this was. No redeeming quality whatsoever. Joel Schumacher sure does know how to muck a movie up, eh? Cage gave it his all, but he just wasn't believable. The only truly good thing about this movie was Peter Stormare. This was on lots of critic's "Worst Of The Year" lists, and for once, I actually agree with them. Avoid at all costs. But if you're a Cage nut, rent it. If you buy it' you'll be kicking yourself.
2652	VERY DURABLE: I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT A FEW YEARS AGO AND IT STILL LOOKS BRAND NEW. IT HAS REALLY HELD UP.
2653	Great for art history students!: A glossary of art terms. This book is a definite must for those writing analyses of art. It's also good for looking up those tricky terms in your text books. It is filled with artsy terms and illustrations. I used it in all my art history classes.
2654	Great for Little Kids: I have a 9 yr old great niece that loves to have pretend phone calls with friends so I thought it would be fun to give her a "cell" phone that wasn't one of the baby toy phones on which she's been playing...my idea to help her grow up a little. This phone was really too young for her...it's very plastic and really geared for a 4 or 5 year old or even younger.That being said, the seller was great about accepting a return; they handled the transaction very quickly and easily for me.I would recommend this phone for a young child; it just didn't fit what I was trying to accomplish.
2655	Don't waste your money!: This book is a waste of money! No useful information at all. This book is definitely less than I expected.
2656	No Zero Star Rating?: This album is just putrid. How anyone could not break this immediately after listening to it is a sign of clear dementia. These guys not only cannot sing or play music, they are also a bunch of jesus worshipping fags. Just listen to "Ascendancy". This is clearly one of the worst bands I have ever heard. They are trying to be Killswitch mixed with old school crappy power metal. A true failure and any fan of Trivium should be immediately led into their local gas chamber.
2657	Don't. Seriously, don't.: Oh, so very bad. Not "good" bad, but rather "bad" bad. There's no accounting for taste, though, so I will say that if you really liked "Battlefield Earth" it's worth giving this a shot.
2658	Leaks badly: I agree with other upset users - a slightest movement will trigger the leak. If the top container is in a slightly different position, the water leaks from it onto the water tray and then down to the floor through a hole in the bottom. Very bad design!
2659	Not as accurate as I thought it would be: I made a number of measurements on a flat highway, using a reflector held up by a friend of mine as a target. The distances varied from 100 feet to 300 feet, all of them additive to about 1/2 mile. I then measured the distance with a GPS in high-res mode and with a precision wheel. The laser range finder read too low by 200 feet out of 2,000. I have since stopped using it.
2660	Terrible Book: After the first few battles, you knew that the Cheyenne was not going to get killed. It was about as interesting as watching someone else play a video game with cheats enabled so they couldn't ever be killed. Don't waste your time on this book. Tom should be embarrassed.
2661	Pretty good length: If length is what you're looking for. These shirts help. They are Hanes, so you are obviously not getting some thick shirt. Great for an undershirt. Very generous length, but not so much that it looks like a dress!I would say the sleeves are shorter then I prefer. Probably standard for Hanes though. The "wiggle room" around the arm holes remind me of Jordan brand shirts. A little tight. Not horrible (like Jordan) but smaller then I prefer.Oh, and I have yet to wear one since I've washed them, but the neck was very comfortable, not too tight, but not too loose either. I'm 6 foot 1 and 205 lbs
2662	way better than the sony: It plays pretty much every format made. Upconverting does look nice. Super audio is super. Very nice packaging if that matters to you. I probably need to tweak more yet so final review is not in yet. The tray is weak, but I have not heard of someone breaking it yet... Yuo can also update the firmware if released.I am glad I got it. It cot my cables at [...] 30 foot HDMI and they work great- remember, its digital, you dont need $300 monster cable overpriced CRAP.
2663	So who cares?: The main characters were all people, if I met them in actual life, I would do my best to avoid if I had a choice--either boring or worse. When Jeremy first observed the elegant dining club located in the strangely abandoned warehouse district, I thought I was in some King/horror clone. The story just never got moving, either in plot or character development.Maybe Jonathan needs some advise from his wife Faye.
2664	Greatest rock album of all time.: I just bought this albuma few days ago, and I just can't stop listening to it. Probably their Magnum Opus, this album has onyl nine tracks on it, but ALL of them are woth listening to. "Speak To Me/Breathe", "Time", "Us and Them", "Money", "On The Run(widely considered to the be the first-ever techno song), "Brain Damage", "Eclipse", the whole album is a joy to listen to, and yes, Roger Waters didn't do everything himself. I would recommend this album for anyone who has never heard their music before. Forget "The Wall" and "Echoes", even though those albums are classics, this is easily their best, and will have you listening to it constantly.
2665	Yuck !: No doubt this is great if you are on a diet and need sugar-free but this stuff taste so artificial and the coloring is way too strong. The sweetness leaves a strange unbearable aftertaste. I'm stuck with 20 tiny boxes and I don't think I'll order these again.
2666	a shame that (you) kirk (are/)is relatively so unpopular -: e specially most normal/ignorant white people don't even know you ...hosanna - oh my godno doubt of you're existence anymore
2667	Made worse by the presence of has beens: Usually I like to see my favorite stars from yesteryear camping it up in some new and awful vehicle, but this one just made you feel sorry for them. Van Dien and Eleniak looked so bad, perhaps just from physical and emotional exhaustion at being subjected to this, that I didn't even recognize them till I looked at the credits. Unless you have some visceral hatred of them and wish to see them humiliated, please skip this.
2668	DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!~: Man this guy is all HYPE! Biggest thing to hit rap? More like the biggest thing to hit Dr. Dre and Eminem's bank accounts! It's amazing how easy it is for people to just sit back and accept the garbage some record companies dish out just to make $$$. Hyping 50 cent up so much that people actually believe he is good!
2669	the female bob dylan has a best of .....?!?!?!?!?!?: this would make a terrific torturing device.and if the POW is deaf,just show him/her the cover !!!!!
2670	Poorly Written Textbook: This is a poorly written textbook. It is dry, uninformative and lacks any cohesive organization that would make the material easier to understand. The author uses a set template for each topic (Advantages, Disadvantages, Tax Implications etc.) that sometimes fits and sometimes does not fit the topic at hand. In more than one case, there are bullet items that repeat the same text as previously bulleted items. This is just sloppy editing and a lack of attentiveness ...
2671	Dont waste your money: This guy was trying his best to do a tell all book, but its really just 'pat me on the back, I'm so great' fiction.Read this and wounder how his club ever made it without him cause he did SO much for his club. Just a loser who is pissed that his club had enough of his ego and booted him.Again, dont waste your money on this ego trip that is his fantasy of how he built the largest motorcycle club in the world with both of his hands tied behind his back standing on one foot jumping thru hoops of fire with 200 people chasing him.
2672	GREAT!!!!!!: I first got into this band when I heard the song "Smells like teen spirit". Shockingly its not their best song. I'm going to have to say that "Come as you are" and "In Bloom" are better. Other good song include Lithium and Breed. If you have enough money buy it.
2673	Owl Babies by Martin Waddell: This book is beautifully illustrated by Patrick Benson. It is about three owl babies that are alone in their home. They get anxious waiting for their mother to return. It tells about the general characteristics of an owl. The story would be great to read to preschoolers that get upset when they leave their parents.*Teacher's note* I have used this book when planning for a unit on Nocturnal animals.
2674	Sage Advice: Lloyd Ogilvie has been a pilar of wisdom and support for people across the globe for 40 + years. This book will force you to examine your prayer life, and it will change the way you view your relationship with God. This is not a formula for better prayer, or the current rage, health and wealth gospel. Dr. Ogilvie challenges us to memorize scripture, using the words the apostles and prophets used to talk to God. This is effective. After having the chance to meet Dr. Ogilvie in person, I know his heart is one of someone who is seeking after God.This book is sage advice, Dr. Ogilvie is a humble man of God who has sage wisdom. I recommend this book, and hearing Dr. Ogilvie preach in person. You will not be dissapointed.
2675	Capitalizing on the 8 mile mythos: Were it not for Eminem's diatribes of the hood and a handful of curious Detroiter's (former and current), I can't imagine what interest this book would hold for anyone. I know the area Clemens speaks of and it is nothing short of amazing that he has so little to write about that is interesting. I suspect that the author was an "academic-in-waiting" from his earliest years and that the sounds and heat of the street were a little too dangerous for his sensitive soul. I will give him credit for being a decent writer, though. Furthermore, claims by a number of reviewers that Mr. Clemens is racist are pure politically correct nonsense. It is more likely the case that the author is guilty of being white and a bit naive.
2676	Buyer Beware: I loved my first one so much I bought a second for my daughter. I understand items are sometimes defective, but I had to return this. IRivers support is awful. Their customer service skills are nonexistent. They advised me that I would "just have to wait" for my return, and told me they could give me no information on the status. This answer came 10 business days after their email stating it would ship in three. Should you ask to speak to a supervisor, none will be available. PLEASE check this company's information with the Better Business Bureau before you purchase. My problem was ultimately resolved, but IRiver would not even contact the better business bureau. I won't purchase from them again. I only purchase from vendors where I can get good customer service.
2677	Not ready for prime time: Save your money!! This book is defintely NOT for professionals who are serious about literature related to weapons of mass destruction. The book contains numerous technical errors. The author overlooks even basic security procedures - never mind the extensive security procedures that the Olympics will implement - in order to conveniently develop his unrealistic scenario .The main purpose of this book appears to be propaganda for the National Guard RAID teams (now called Civil Support Teams). Even here, the book is not credible as the author greatly overstates the role and responsibilities of these National Guard teams.
2678	Perfect fit.: These covers were the perfect fit for my 2003 Yukon. Everything about the design is custom to the seat. The fabric is a high quality rugged grade, almost like canvas. I expect that I'll get some mileage out of these. The price is well worth what you're paying for.
2679	Not sure: I bought this for my girlfriend to try. She was offended and she refuse to use it. So I don't know if it works or not.
2680	Hanger is something thats not for everyone: Hanger is something thats not for everyone. but if your a fan of the directors last movie Gutterballs you will like this movie. this flick is depressing,hardcore,and sometimes right to the bone gross and if you like films that pull no punches like nekromantik, Cannibal holocaust, or even last house on dead end street then this flick might be for you.
2681	Great sound at an affordable price: This 6.1 speaker system sounds terrific with our Yamaha RXV630 receiver. They perform very well for normal TV viewing and music, but really shine when watching a DVD with true surround sound.They were easy to set up. The set includes color-coded wires which correspond to individual speakers; you do have to provide the appropriate connectors on the wires to make them compatible with your receiver.The speakers are bigger than some other surround sound systems, but they are solidly built with quality wood cases. The three small rear speakers have built-in mounting brackets.
2682	Long live this mouse: I was hesitant about this mouse because some of the reviews said it went through a lot of batteries. I've had the mouse for 19 months (and have hardly even turned it off during that time), and yes I've replaced the batteries a few times, but that seems normal. It's really a champ. I do periodically have bluetooth connectivity problems, but that's on the PC side, not the mouse, and all I need to do is turn my PC bluetooth control off and back on again and it finds the mouse. I use a Dell Latitide X1 running XP Pro. I've been very happy with this mouse.
2683	A poor description on the French middle age: This book was a dissapointment. I was looking forward to receive it, because the subject interested me. The content may be of some value to a frenchman, especialy for one living in Paris, but there is hardly anything for the common man of the world.
2684	Am I Alone Here?: Am I the only person who feels like Mitch Albom writes with extreme egocentric undertones? I couldn't even absorb the lessons and wisdom I was supposed to be taking away from this book because I was so aggravated by Mr. Albom's narssicism. It seems like every page was steeped in a light bath of 'thank goodness Morrie had me' attitude. Not to mention the outright statements like the part where Mitch talks about if he died, his boss wouldn't even care as long as he had some of his amazing writing underneath his dead body.To me, a young but frequent reader, this book felt more like a tribute to Mitch than a tribute to Morrie. Did anyone else feel that way about this book? Or am I way off base here?
2685	$30 battery pack???: We as well just opened our tyco roll cage remote control cars for our boys and had all batteries counted and ready to go. We looked at every toy to make sure we bought appropriate batteries for this morning. Well.....needless to say, we are very upset to find out that the TMH pack is separate. The package is very misleading and usually toy manufactures are very considerate and note exactly which size battery is needed for their product. Well. not Tyco. Very disappointed. We as well didn't understand the TMH~ thinking it came with product and all we had to do was add AA batteries. Well. Never again will we be taken.
2686	This will sneak up on you!: This film was first shown on TV at the boomtime of recovery when Betty Ford was pushing for recovery for families affected by addiction. The story portrays a middleclass family hiding dad's (Sheen's) alcoholism and sliding down the slope of denial. The reactions of the family to crises and the roles they each fall into are so accurately done that the viewer can get way into his/her own alcoholic upbringing and pain before they are aware of it.I have shown this at several gatherings and it never fails to shake some people up seriously. Kids are especially vulnerable in their teen years. But entire families can get very agitated during the viewing.So I would recommend that anyone showing or viewing this film be prepared to deal with some extreme reactioons for several days afterwards. Don't just show this and send your guests home. Instead have a discussion and a followup trip to a meeting of Alateen, Al-Anon or AA.BUT SHOW IT!
2687	Quite good...: This book is quite good in that it has detailed commentary on a few of the bigger, well-known streams in California. I'm a bit disappointed that he did not include any commentary on other streams that are actually quite productive with large fish (I own another of Sunderland's books and I know he's aware of other "blue ribbon" streams).Anyway, it's a good book... but it only really covers a few rivers/streams while leaving many out.
2688	Love my Wireless Door Chime: This is actually a replacement for an identical unit which was taken out by an electrical surge during a storm. It has expanded ring melodies and is a real hit with the grand kids. I chose this many years ago when my wired door bell system died, and I realized that replacing the existing one with another wired system would require me to cut a hole in my ceiling to replace the failed part. I never had any trouble with the previous unit and am not expecting any with this one.The unit ordered from [...] arrived as ordered and much faster than I expected.
2689	WILL IT WORKS GOOD AND THATS ALL THAT COUNTS: Well i have had this product for a while and it still works great.The price of $60.00 is worth it the bad thing about is its screen resolution sucks but the screen is very bright.Bottom line its worth buying.
2690	Getting the tray to work!: Tray rejections with the R-200 is part of the design flaw of the early models. While tech support says that the tray is warped and you need to buy a new one-or two, it usually is just worn. Try this: First check the lip for warping, if it is warped, heat it with a hair dryer on high setting and flatten it between two flat surfaces. If it's worn, place a thin, and thinned, layer of clear nail polish on the wear marks on the bottom of the leading edge. The leading edge is that thin, clear, plastic lip on the edge of the tray. No nail polish? Try a very thin layer of super glue as I did, over the entire clear strip. But definitely make sure it is dry before you print. Seems to work great. OK product, stinking design and not at all helpful company-their fault, they should make good on it. Go for an alternative if possible.
2691	Gritty Little Stories: Some of this collection of short stories doesn't work. I don't see the point of "Words Left Unspoken" - there's no story there. "The Old Man and Dancing Lisa" leaves you wanting more, but there isn't more. And "Liberty" is not just real at all.But then you get the good stuff......the title story is excellent. "The Birthday Gift" is writing at it's best. "Merry Christmas" floors you. "Candles on the Cake" is so detailed and warm and shocking, it leaves you turning the pages faster and faster at the end. "Friends," the final story leaves you cheering - a good man standing up for himself.It has it's faults, but most books of short stories do. I paid eleven bucks for this book and I look forward to what this writer has next up his sleeve. I think it's just going to get better.
2692	Only in a movie theater: This came to me as a gift. I watched the movie only once before and that was in a movie theater. It was magical. That is why i was so disappointed watching this at home. It did not have the magic. I wished I never watched it on my TV and remember this movie with that theater experience.
2693	Not what I was expecting: With a picture of Zach Galifianakis on the cover I was expecting this to be a good comedy. I was disapppointed that he only had a small part in the movie. Rent before you buy on this one.
2694	doesn't work well at all. It's quite b/c it doesn't do much!: find something else. It's quite but if it doesn't do what you're paying for it to do then what's the point?!Forget this item and move on.
2695	Tom B. is a joke: As bigfoot researchers go Tom B. is a total joke. He has done more harm to the researchibg for bigfoot than ANYONE alive. He has helped in the hoaxs that been brought to the media and then blame the other person as the hoaxer. Anyone who had a encounter with a gigfoot please do0 not contact this person. Try contacting a more reliable group and you can find fhem on the web but never go to Tom B.
2696	BUYER BEWARE---The beginning of the Chip Davis Rehash: I'm sure Steamroller fans of the GREAT old days have realized this band is toast and totally out of ideas and have been for some time. Mega-wealth does strange things to folks, and in Chip Davis' and Jackson Berkey's case...a case of extreme laziness. While Saving the Wildlife had some previously released material, this release from 1989 is where Davis realized that ''Greatest Hits'' (so-called) collections will sell also. On this release, tracks 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, and 15 are all rehashes from previous Fresh Aire releases. I haven't been afflicted like some who have stated that listening to their masterworks of the 70s and 80s is too painful knowing what this band has now become. Fresh Aire 1-7, Saving the Wildlife, and the first two Christmas albums are still so "fresh" and exciting. But for the present...no more of my money, Chip. Sorry, I work too hard for it.
2697	One of the best album's I own: I didn't expect music this good to come out of a rigged show, American Idol. This is a fantastic CD for people of all ages. It is just delightful. Underwood has a strong, versatile voice. Everybody can relate to this music, its pleasant. They have songs not only on 'Love' issues..
2698	BORING!!!!!!!: You can't judge a book by its cover and you can't judge a computer game by its box. Granted the game looks cool, but its sooo confusing! The instruction booklet is like 2 pages and just gives credits for who made the game- who would want to take credit for this awful game? The game is way to boring and takes a Harvard graduate to understand. If you want a real game get Age of Empires or Empire Earth.
2699	DVD has some kind of regional Lock.: Beware! This DVD doesn't work in all Areas /Regions. Will not work in DVD player, must send back!This is a FIVE point movie! Has the original Doc Marten!
2700	a real shocker: as a jew, i feel sick to my core after reading the facts revealed in this book. it covers a subject most jews are ignorant of. the betrayal by some of the early zionists ( and betrayal of the jews by the allies,) of the close to one million jews of hungary. these jews lost their lives when they could have been saved!as a zionist myself the book doesnt make me think zionism is bad it just changes my opinion of some of our early 'leaders'.it is a very dark part of the history of the jewish people, a part of our history to be ashamed of.
2701	Insane: I really have not seen this DVD yet but if this is any thing like her other stuff, then it's going to be nuts.
2702	if you like pain then this is for you.: I'm a hairy guy, shave my chest and back. I'm somewhere between a 6-7 on a scale of 1-10, I've seen guys more hairy than me. My friends call me carpet daddy and tell me I should leave my sweater at home when I'm at the pool.This thing is battery powered, ok no big deal so I slap in two double A's and I'm thinking ok this has got some power so here we go. Ouch, not really that bad but not worth it to me. It's a great idea but maybe the blade is not sharp enough, not really sure but the discomfort is not worth it. I gave up after a few seconds of pain, I guess it grabs your hairs and skin a little.My Remington trimmer does a far better job, I can shave my back w/my trimmer but takes a lot of skill and patience, I'd rather have that than the dealing w/the discomfort of this mangroomer thing.
2703	Daniel Band fans take note: this is Toni Rossi: If you are a fan of Daniel Band, then you'll like this. TRB is Toni Rossi who is the guitar player and one of the vocalists for Daniel Band. The music on this album is heavy rock like Daniel Band's music and sounds like Daniel Band since Rossi was one of the main contributors to Daniel Band along with Dan McCabe. Highly recommended.
2704	Not a toy; a real strategic thinking game: Great strategy game. Combines auctions and placement decision making to test your strategic thinking. Can be long for 5 players.
2705	Not compatible with newer ipods! Not a good dock!: This dock is a terrible buy. The sound quality is decent at best, the remote doesn't control the functions of the ipod, and the batteries must be taken out of the speakers when it is plugged into a socket. In addition, the connecter port doesn't connect easily, and you have to really jam the ipod down to get the sound to come out of the speakers. I'm pissed that I bought this, and I'm going to look into getting a refund.
2706	I'm trying to help, please read.: it's saterday, june 19, and still have not got any confermation that the gun I orderd is even coming when i orderd this over a month ago. when I resived a pakage from this company thinking it was the gun I orderd, I was wrong. I bought this gun hopping for five stare matirrial and survace, and boy was i wrong with that one.first of they sent me the wrong gun,then they tell me i did not buy the gun I orderd, and i have a resete for it.then they tell me there out of stock, so i ask for my money back, they say no and to wait till more come in.so i waited for my gun and nothing came.so i call them and they said that theyed give me my money back.that arived on time but they were 5 dollairs short.and the stock came in so I thought i could buy it again and mabie it wouldn't happen this time.but now it's $44.95 insted of $24.99 origonaly, not only that but the pic has changed again.
2707	one of the most influential books on my life: This book hit me in high school like a shimmering beam of light. It made me start questing my motives for what activities I was spending my time doing, what kind of clothes I was wearing, and what things I was saying. I think like many teens a lot of my actions had to do with wanting to impress my classmates or to put up an image that I thought would make me popular. Once I read this book I couldn't go through through life without asking "why am I doing this?" over all of my important decisions. It's liberating to choose what'll make you happy, not what you think will make others like or respect you.
2708	Out-of-box failure: This was to be my first Krups "programmable" coffee maker. It was supposed to replace my old Krups unit which had lasted for many years. What a disappointment -- it was impossible to set the clock!(a necessary requirement) The specific PROBLEM: the HR and MIN buttons responded erratically and the proper time setting could not be achieved. Don't ask how much time I wasted before giving up. So I recognized a lemon and made my first-ever return to Amazon. HAPPY ENDING: the return procedure was very easy, Amazon paid for everything (even the shipping) and I got all my money back.
2709	Works GREAT with my traumatized child.: This is a fantastic approach to use with traumatized kids, or any kid who over reacts to life's frequent surprises or upsets.Constant punishment does not work with traumatized kids....it just increases their "fight" response. My child would keep fighting even if all 4 of his limbs were broken. In his mind he is trying to survive at the most basic level, even in response to smallest upset. What works is to prepare him for what to expect in the day and compassion when he is on alert, or worked up, then later discuss the problem with his behavior. He is now a different kid : ) Consequences are necessary, but not in the moment, that just amplifies the problem. If we followed what works with a "regular kid" then our kid would grounded to an empty room for the duration of his childhood.
2710	It's nice until it breaks..and it will break.: Like some earlier positive reviews, I like the performance of this player when it's new and working. But the construction of this thing is barely acceptable. In my case, the left hinge "exploded" while closing the screen - it snapped apart and a small screw fell out. I am very careful and cautious with my stuff and this unit was not stressed in any way.I sent the unit back under warranty (5 months old - maybe 10 uses) and WaCA/Petters did eventually send a new unit, but it took 2 months and 3 phone calls. I have no expectation of long-term satisfaction from the new player.Overall this has been a learning experience. No more disposable Polaroid electronics for me. You are advised to look elsewhere.
2711	He had me for the first 120 pages...: ...and then things came crashing down. Too much "Dear Blue." Too much self-absorption. Too much melancholy.
2712	Finally, a book that tells it like it is.: I loved this book. Finally, a diet/lifestyle book that empowers you think before you put food in your mouth. I hate the fact that we never question the healthcare in this country. Doctors medicate and we just follow along. This book changed my life. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars is the chapter on quotes from people that work in the slaughterhouses. I couldn't get through it. I thought it was propaganda for animal rights and didn't need to be in a health book. Other than that, an excellent book.
2713	Good Display Item: I bought this, with several other flags to show my heritage at my wedding. They are now exhibited in my den, adding to the atmosphere. They would work well for outdoor display, too, but would not hold up well in the long run.
2714	Disappointed: One gets the feeling the author was rushed, because this tale is awkward and the characters poorly developed. I realize that Mr. Koontz has reworked an earlier book but there are unrealistic turns of events as well as superficial descriptions. At one point, Elliot says to Tina "that's not the Tina I know". Considering that he has only known her for about 24 hours when he makes this statement, it is a ridiculous thing to say. At any rate, if you are looking for a quick and easy read, this book will do the trick.
2715	Take My Theory, Please!: Despite the credentials of the author and the individuals interviewed, and the apparent sincerity of all those involved, the whole thing smacks of conversion fever; intelligent, educated and experienced people somehow warped by their brush with the beyond, or their taste for it. We don't get any semblance of facts, data or science to make this book worth buying except to encourage and embolden the flock. A mish-mash of truncated interviews stirred into a stew pot boiling with biblical mysticism, new age pop, psychological paranoia, mass conspiracy theory, mentalism....am I leaving anything out folks? When we finally get to the ignobly defrocked Uri Geller it was time to ring the bell, close the book, and quench the candle.At $24 for a mere 224 paperback pages it may not play in Peoria, but I'm sure they'll move a few copies in Roswell. Cool looking cover though!
2716	Consider it disposable: Got this bag for my kid's umbrella stroller to take on trips. Good size, covers the stroller pretty well and mine is a relatively mid/large size umbrella stroller. The tie-string and handle are well made and feel durable. However, like the other reviews mentioned, the bag material is not very thick, therefore tear easily. After the first 1.5 hour plane ride, it already got a 2-3 inch tear near where the bottom wheels are. (only via gate-check, not baggage claim.) I'm duck-taping the hole for now. Still usable, but I don't expect it last for more than 3-4 more trips. If the material is little more durable, it would've been a very good bag.Also, the storage pouch is a bit too small. The bag will fit in the pouch if it's folded nicely and air-tight. If you are in a hurry and just stuff the bag into the pouch (like they showed in the video on the manufacture website), good luck zipping it up.I would buy it again if it's about $5, just use it as a few-time-use disposable bag.
2717	Two discs won't play.: Discs 6 and 11 won't play. Big damaged spots, you can see through the discs. Humbly request replacement or refund.
2718	Well, I read it, not sure why.: This book has an incredibly slow start. I wasn't until about page 92 that the story actually got a bit interesting. This book made me remember why I don't read Stephen King. It was just out of despiration, and the fact that I didn't have another book with me that I actually continued to read it. If I hadn't spent $20 on it, I would have gotten rid of it.
2719	Good for 4 year old: Things I liked- more realistic bodies (spring ferry has fecund, plush thighs), no "bad guys", good for sensitive children. Music was a bit bland. Not a very good plot but fine for kids.
2720	What happened to my beloved hummningbird flosser???: Ok, it's Oct 10, 2011 and I'm on my last hummingbird flosser replacement head. I can get one head to last around 3 months and I bought a big pack of about 30 of them for $4 or so many years ago. TO MY UTTER DISMAY, I couldn't find any replacement heads at Walmart, Walgreens or RiteAid this morning. I come home and go online to find out they have been discontinued. WHAT?! Why on earth did they discontinue this perfect product? I never used a battery in mine to make it vibrate, but the size and grip of this product was ideal for flossing. I go online and find that people are actually selling replacing heads for 20 TIMES AT MUCH as they use to cost! Crazy! I guess I will just have to find a new flosser. Still can't believe they discontined this perfect flosser!!!! Bring back the hummingbird! Please, I beg you!
2721	classic sewing reference book: I bought this book for my daughter. She is a beginning sewer. This book is filled with practical, relevant advice for the novice or experienced sewer. I have one exactly like it!
2722	World record broken --lasts only 1 hour!: It worked great until it died. The first LifeDrive died after 4 days. It just turned off in the middle of something and wouldn't turn back on (even with the battery fully charged) The second LifeDrive lasted only 1 hour. It froze up after hot synching it and won't unfreeze even after resetting. I'm not going to give them a third chance -- its a lot of money for such poor quality!
2723	great movie: i do not know what everybody is talking about the song that they say is missing is there the other people must be on stupid pills
2724	The whys and wherefores of kitties!: Stephen Budiansky has taken all the latest scientific and psychological research done on cats to date and simmered it down into this compact little volume for the lay reader. It explores everything from the origin of the purr to the origin of the black-cat mythos, from why cats meow to why they can be stand-offish or even bite the hand that feeds them. I now understand why my cats will head-butt me to offer affection (there are scent-marking organs in the forehead--who knew?), as well as why and how each of my cats ended up with their very different temperaments. From biology to sociology, mythology to psychology, this slim book covers it all.While Budiansky's work is always informative and very complete, it's only occasionally entertaining which, I suspect, is more a result of my expectations as a reader on this subject than any of the author's fault. Would I recommend it? Most certainly, especially to those of you who are cat owners.
2725	This book isn't for learning VisualLISP/AutoLISP: If the CD doesn't accompany the book, the book is worthless. The majority of this book is simply a guide to the API included on the CD. To make matters worse, I don't believe the CD contains the source code for the API, which basically makes it a black box. The author also puts some fairly strict restrictions on how the files on the CD or programs written with the book's API can be distributed.This book isn't for someone who wants to learn VisualLISP or AutoLISP. I was very dissapointed in the book and felt that I wasted my money on it.
2726	falls apart: i bought this for my 5 yr old it fell apart as soon as she played with it. it's much to flimsy.
2727	MECHANICAL DEFECTS WITH THIS DEVICE: Mechanical defects such as "toner is not set", when cartridge is properly loaded make this device suspect and unreliable at best. Problems with cartridges. It seems other buyers are having same problem. I would not purchase. Also issue and difficulty with software and problems with installation on PC and MAC systems.
2728	Not in color!!!: My son needed this book fast. I was pleased to find the book in hard cover and color. Unfortunately, when we received the book it was not in color. I ended up having to go all over town looking for it. Book was in mint condition, but not color. Disappointed.
2729	Great TV at a Great Price: This is an excellent tv. Crisp, clear picture especially in high def. Plenty of adjustment features to obtain the picture and sound you prefer. Very easy to set-up and customize. Plenty of input/output ports for most tv viewers. Unbelieveable colors and details. Standard definition broadcasts are also improved. I do not have a high def. dvd player, but since it is a progressive scan player the picture quality is very close to high def. with this tv. I would recommend this tv to anyone looking for a top of the line tv at a great price. I got mine for $900 with free shipping.
2730	NBA Live 99: Woooo! This game has 21 Century graphics that will knock your socks off. I was desperate for an action packed NBA game since I'm a huge B-ball fan. Get ready be blown back on your tailfin!
2731	not durable enough: I bought this for tour.the locks aren't durable enough. the handle is strong enough for any amount of gear what would fit in this unit.there are MANY better companies that make an item like this.I contacted GATOR ... they said they'd replace it ... then stopped answering my emails.I'd skip this one.
2732	value for money: I expect a 3.5 mm audio jack and the pendant is little bigger than expected. It works with my thinkpad T61, and my cell phone. with the laptop the sound quality is not good. but with mobile quality is excellent.
2733	Get Ghost in the Shell 1 and skip this one: GitS 2 is a confused mis-mash of CGI and traditional Japanese animation. The CGI is completely out of place and it distracts the viewer, not letting them into the story. It has the makings for a good story, but the presentation is simply awful.
2734	Awful! Dreadful!: Sorry to the fans of this author and genre, but this book is truly one of the worst I have ever read. Basically, the characters are extremely dry, weak, and/or naive beyond belief. Secondly, common with sci-fi stories, there's no spiritualality. OK, for this story, in the future, man dumps God and all religions and uses religion as a mere tool. But that always leaves a gaping hole. Something's always missing when any sort of spirituality is removed.Just a dull, political rambling.
2735	Silver Alarm Clock: I am really happy with my own clock, I had purchased more as gifts, however was a little disappointed to find they were silver and not blue as shown in the pictures, but for ease and functionality of use they are great even for the not so tek savvy elders of our society.
2736	Love it!: This CD has been in my possession for about 5 years, and it's still one of my favorites! It has music from very well known singers like Leonard Cohen and Van Morrison, and more obscure ones. The mix is unbeatable!
2737	NATAY IS WHAT THE NATIVES NEED HE IS BEAUTIFUL: I FOUND HIS FIRST CD THAT I CANNOT REMEMBER THE NAME OF IN A TINY LITTLE NATIVE SECTION OF CHEAPO RECORDS. I WAS OVERWHIMED WITH HIS WORDS, HIS PASSION AND HIS TALENT. I HAVE BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR HIM SINCE THEN MAKING ALL MY COUSINS ON THE REZ LISTEN TO HIS CD. NOT ONE PERSON SAID THEY DID NOT LIKE IT AND MOST OF THE GIRLS THOUGHT HE WAS SEXY. HE HAS ALOT TO SAY ABOUT OUR CULTURE AND THE STRUGGLES WE GO THROUGH.
2738	Galileo bones: I was told how great these bones are and I have to agree! They are tough. A local dog day care uses them and said they last a long long time. As in maybe a year. They cost $25 at a local pet store and the chain pet stores don't carry this size. So I was thrilled to find them online and the price was great too!
2739	Amazing!: This is one of the best EPs I have ever came across. All three songs are just brutal. I would highly recommend getting this CD with the two bonus demo tracks but if you have the Nightmares Made Flesh special edition with the two bonus track then don't get this version I did by mistake but I still love it.
2740	Expendable, even if you don't want it to be: Do you like throwing your phone away every year to replace it with a newer model? With the VTech 5879 you're wait will be even shorter! I don't know why I replaced the original purchase of this phone (Jan. 07) with the exact same one (Aug. 09) but the bottom line is that the usable life went from 18 months to half that time. Despite replacing the battery and cleaning the contacts the handset will simply not charge. Result? No more Vtech phones for me.
2741	Best Christmas Gift.: I purchased this book for a friend and she loved it. I got it really quickly and it was in great condition. Nothing bad to say here. Thanks
2742	1-2-3- Magic: I found this book to be a excellent resource for learning how to control "stop" behaviors. I am not as convinced on the start behavior tactics but we are going to give it a try.
2743	Mice eat and walk fine right bellow them: Ì don't know if I should laugh. They are working and making their noise and mice just walk by totally unconcerned. This item is good for nothing. A waste of money
2744	Exactly as expected.: I bought it as a 3-pack. Came exactly as expected. Each filter was shrink wrapped with plastic. Great price... I will continue to buy my refills from here.
2745	A side of Iran I've never seen.: This documentary was extremely interesting and sad. What the young girls have to do to survive is depressing. There were times where I felt angry that the mother was endangering her child but I had to remind myself that their culture is different. All in all, I highly recommend this documentary.
2746	Just get the free EasyLanguage manual from TradeStation: Much of the text here is already covered in TradeStation's free EasyLanguage reference. The book is sloppily written and edited, and the coding style leaves much to be desired. It is a weird combination of EasyLanguage syntax, trader interviews (get Market Wizards series instead), and a few "winning" trading systems, which really are not winners at all. Basically, the text was cobbled together without any underlying insights into how to really build winning trading systems.
2747	How do novels like this ever get published?: Cecilia Holland panned this novel, writing that the author "is ignorant of the education needed to reconstruct so remote a time. Her characters are strictly twentieth century." Barbara Grier simply wrote that it "may have the distinction of being the worst book ever written about Sappho."How novels like this see the light of day is a mystery. It earns one star, only because there's no option for no stars.
2748	Madras Curry: Exceptional taste and packed to the top! It has just enough pepper in it for that good, hot kick normally associated with quality curries. I was using Cross and Blackwell but since they stopped their curry line the search was daunting but this is just as good, dare I say better!
2749	What happened to these films?????: Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 are great, but this film is a major disappointment. The humor is retarded, and the effects are poor for 1992!!! I wish they'd cut out the noticable humor. In Evil Dead, it was funny, but not ridiculous. It was scary, too. But, this one was just soooooooo stupid. It wasn't even scary. I sat through the whole movie, hoping it would end, and laughing at how stupid it was. If they make another Evil Dead movie, PLLLLLEEEEAAASEE make a better one.
2750	Maximize the Moment: God's Action Plan for Your Life: T.D. Jakes is truly an annointed man of God. This is the fourth of his books that I have read -- true to form, I learned SO much from it/him. If you are looking for direction, struggling in relationships or business, or just want some food for thought, this is the book to read.
2751	Good Controller: What can I say about this controller? It's sturdy and fits my hands well. Battery life on the controller is pretty good...it'll last me about 20-24 hrs. of playing time; howeve, people who game more often may want a rechargeable kit. It's funny how prices of the xbox360 goes down, but the controller stays the same. The controller is pricey but what are the other alternatives?
2752	Very Complete Retelling of the Robin Hood Tales: The Adventures of Robin Hood by Roger Lancelyn Green is a brilliant retelling of the Robin Hood tales. All of the stories are here. Robin's fight with Little John is related, as is the archery contest, Robin's love affair with Marion, and the wedding of Allan-a-Dale. All of the characters like Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet, Little John, Maid Marion, and (guess what!) Robin Hood make their appearances. Overall, the tales are well told, and the book is very complete. My favorite portion of this edition is the prologue in which the author writes from where the stories are derived. There, I was turned to Thomas Love Peacock's brilliant, if forgotten, tales of Robin Hood entitled Maid Marian. This edition will help to keep the adventures of Robin Hood in the minds of children for another generation.
2753	Great Collection even for a fanboy.: Alright, everyone needs to calm down. I've been a fan since 1979 and although this collection didn't have everything I wanted (original theatrical release & digital copies), This collection looks amazing on Blu Ray. I watched them with my daughter and she absolutely loved the movies. I showed her the original trilogy and then we went back to watch the prequels. So, before you completely dismiss this collection, trust me that you'll enjoy seeing them in HD and having George's definitive vision. He actually "improved" the Han Solo/Greedo meeting in the Cantina and although Han didn't technically shoot first, it was recut to look a lot better than the previous version. I was pleasantly surprised. He actually gave in a little and listened to how awful it looked before.Anyway, I really like having them all in one collection and you will too. So stop complaining and "give in to your feelings." And buy the set.
2754	A good book with a lot of truth in it.: I bought this book as part of a library I am building, trying to learn why my wife left me and what I can do to get her back.There are good things in this book. I learned new ways to look at my wife, and what to look for in what I see.I will give one criticism that some might find not helpful. At the beginning of the book the author tells us that he is a christian, and many of his insight are directly from his beliefs. After that, he does mention religion a few more times, but it is not pushed terribly hard. My criticism is ... there is entirely too much religion expressed in this book. That is the only reason it only gets four stars.
2755	Great all-in-one printer: I've had this printer for 4 months now and I really like it. It does everything that I need and it's easy to use.This most important factor for me was the ability to share it on the network. Most HP all-in-one printer's don't allow you to share it on the network. Xerox states that they don't "support" network sharing, but that give detailed instructions on how to do it (They just don't want people to call tech support for it).It turns out that sharing a workcentre 385 is just like any other printer (very easy). Not so for HP's all-in-one printers. Their special driver that doesn't have sharing capabilities.I fully recommend this printer.
2756	Horrible product.: I bought one of these, it lasted 5 minutes before it stopped working. It has a "lifetime" warranty. I took advantage of this. I got a "new" sprayer through Gilmour. It lasted 5 minutes and stopped working. I again contacted Gilmour. I gave them the model number and even sent pictures of what the sprayer looked like. They sent me the wrong parts for the sprayer I had. I complained again. They wanted to send me another "new" sprayer. I told them I wanted a refund, I was tired of their lousy product. They refused. So, avoid Gilmour for everything. They make crap.
2757	CL Suson, author of Independence Day Plague: The book, in fact the whole series, is a fascinating read. The main character, Lilly Bard is a tough gal with a bad past. She is generally antisocial, intelligent and fiercely defensive. This makes her a deeply interesting character as you follow her through solving this mystery.
2758	Absolutely joyful and totally entertaining with mystery.: As entertaining as any of Mark Twain's works. Fun for all ages. Great stroy and lessons in life as well as Twain's great gift for humor, subtle and obvious. Totally entertaining with enough drama to keep your interest. Great for entertainment, education or teaching.
2759	not as easy to use as I thought: The sling was not very easy to use and never seemed to reall work right
2760	The Strokes are great: No matter what some of you people believe, The Strokes are a nice change to the old predominantly hardcore rock scene. They are an upbeat, fun to listen to group who can put anyone in a good mood. Also, they're all talented and are sure to continue to produce even better albums ad they fine tune their talents and become more comfortable with the singing/songwriting process.
2761	This position is unmanned: When reading all the praise of Nicholson Baker's prose, on the dust jacket, and his ability to use the English language to create a satirical edge, I expected something more substantial. Apparently, this is case of reputation leading the book. There is nothing funny (except the Bush seeking Bullets), nor ironic in the text, and satire is checked in at another hotel. One cannot feel any emotional impact the ravings of Jay, as he plots to kill the bush baby in the White House. (Although, I suspect that if Shrub could read, the book just might make him catatonic.) This really is not a novel, but a one-act play.
2762	The previous reviwer is entirely correct: The contents of this book are unedited garbage. And the reason is....Books published by General Books LLC are put together using an OCR automated scanning device which can miss complete pages. Typos are frequent and there's no table of contents. There is ABSOLUTELY NO EDITING of the book and the scanning is done by a robot (probably the reason half the book is on Wimax - the robot picked up something else as well).This is all stated on the publishers web site (google them and read - you'll be as shocked as I was when you get all the details). The owner of General Books LLC, VDM Publishing, is notorious for these ripoffs - almost every review of their books (around 500,000 of them from one imprint or another now listed on Amazon) by an actual buyer is negative, many are extremely so.If you have bought the version from General Books LLC by mistake, you can return to Amazon within 30 days(but check Amazon's Return Policy for the details)
2763	Broken DVD: Upon opening the DVD case, the DVD was cracked from edge to center. I was not able to play the DVD and I promptly returned it.
2764	Great for a healthy mouth!: Purchased this to replace an 8 year old Sonicare Advance. This model is inexpensive and very similar to our original model, but I miss the quadrapace feature. Just hope this lasts as long as the original one.
2765	Too much "poop" talk.....: This video made our family very uncomfortable w/the language. If you want "poop" or "pee", this would be a terrific video
2766	Clean Dr Screen Cleaner: Wonderful stuff - as a service center for multiple laptop manufacturers we run across some pretty bad screens and this stuff has never faltered in removing the grime and dust. Smells great too!
2767	Wade In The Water: This compilation is an educational and inspirational program which chronicles a little known segment of AMERICAN music!!! It is fabulous. There is something for everyone. Truly to gift to the world.
2768	100% satisfecho: producto recibidoen perfectas condiciones, se recibio en un lapso de tiempo aceptable, venededor 100% recomendable.
2769	ok: The only reason this movie is in my library is because of my husband. I've seen it before with him and always fell asleep or found something else to do. Last night I gave this movie a second chance and I have to say.... it wasn't bad. I didn't watch it all the way threw but it is a good movie with good acting.
2770	Disappointing: In one word: disappointing. I don't know why they bothered to release this CD. While the title track is pretty cool, the rest of the tracks are rather pointless throwaways. Belew goes overboard with rather trite-sounding angelic vocal effects. Eyes Open Wide is an interesting tune, but why Larks Tongues Part 4 yet again? I bought this at the same time as Heavy ConstruKction, and HC is great, while this disc blows. I hope this EP is not representative of the new upcoming KC release. Looks like KC hit their peak and are on the downhill side. Bummer since I have been a huge fan since the Bruford/Wetton days.
2771	DVD Tech probs: As much as I love HIMYM, I have to give this 1 star because of of the problems it gives me when I try to run it. Looks like others are having the same problems with the blu ray version, I'm reporting about the DVD version.When I popped disc 1 in my PS3, it started making a loud humming noise like as if the disc reader went into overdrive, I didn't even attempt to play it. I took it out and tried it again, once again loud humming noise. Not cool.I put it in my PC and tried to run it with Media Player Classic, and it loads the 20th century part but scrambled, then shuts down with a error msg Copy Protect-Fail.Got it to run fine using the latest Windows Media Player thankfully.
2772	poor: when i recived the dvds they were not what i ordered i was told Amazon made a mistake on the web site, i had to call shoplet to actually recive my money after i returned the item, i am very disatisfied with shoplet i will not order from them agian. as for the dvd's bought this brand before and they worked with no problems.
2773	Solid toy: This works great for my terripoo. She's not a big chewer, but she's destroyed other toys. This one has survived over a month and looks as if it'll last a long time.
2774	what a wonderful book!: As a avid reader, this is one on the best books I have read all year! I could not put it down! The customs and traditions of the characters are unbelievable! The story kept me so close that I would feel my heart racing! I whole heartly recommend this book.
2775	Cut the crap.: I don't see how anyone can like Ashlee Simpson. No matter how hard she tries, she's not punk. She only wants to be, so that she can be different from her sister. Sure, she has an okay voice. But her music isn't rock, and her voice isn't a rock voice. It's a pop voice. She needs to stop pretending. This song isn't rock like she wants it to be, and the rest of the songs on her upcoming CD probably won't be either. I'll believe she's punk when I hear it.
2776	Arrived broken: I can hear the broken glass sliding around inside the box. No need to open it.I had the same problem with another glass item I purchased, which I re-ordered because Amazon will reimburse me for the return shipping. The other item arrived today intact, so now I'll take a chance on re-ordering these, hoping for the same good fortune! I'll update later with the results.Update: I decided to buy the mugs in a local store rather than re-order them. I need them right away. Oh well...
2777	i want to know: I have both live 2001 and 2k1 and my opinion is 2k1 is better. I've heard that live had a bad year in 2001 and 2002 is going to be great. I also heard that 2k2 is going to have a smarter cpu, much better defence, and the graphics are going to be better(also better graphics with live 2002). I have one question, which is better?2002 or 2k2?
2778	A Must Read for Investing: Jim Cramer's Mad Money: Watch TV, Get RichThis is one very good book. A must read.
2779	How can there be so many grammatical errors in the 8TH edition!?: I must agree with one of the other reviewers in regard to the abundance of grammatical errors. It mystifies me how there could be so many errors in this - the 8th edition - of a book! In addition to grammatical errors there are frequent repeating sentences. For example the author may end one paragraph with a sentence, and then the next paragraph begins with the same sentence...this is not a transition! The content itself is very thorough - perhaps overly thorough, especially in the excessive number of statistics. Statistics stop being useful when perhaps four pages of a thirty page chapter are literally bullet-point lists of statistics. Overall, I believe I am learning from this book, but am certain there are a dozen other books that can do a better job in a more concise way. Perhaps edition 9 will be the lucky number?
2780	Not uplifting at all: Not into techno or rave music which is what this CD is. Yes, the tracks have a gospel flair and I hope God doesn't get offended.
2781	Zmuda Review: I waited two years to see the movie Man on the Moon.It was worth the wait, and now on to the book. Zmudas reference about Mr.X is intriguing, but sadly not revealing. Zmuda does seem to be enamored with himself. His tales of life with Mr. Kaufman basically reflect the tome of the movie.If you are a fan of Kaufmans you will enjoy this book.If you like Zmuda you will also like the book.It was very enjoyable, and an easy read.
2782	A Triumph for Daria Fans: Finally, after so many years of waiting, Daria has been released on DVD. My greatest concern, however, was how the updated music would compare. In all honesty, to a die-hard fan, the difference is noticeable. One of the great things about the show was the soundtrack; however, the wit and intelligence of the script makes you forget. The music feels appropriate and does not detract from the story. The quality is great as well(compared to watching it on TV). All in all, I am thrilled with the release and would recommend it to everyone.
2783	Best Pocket Guide: I was inspired to buy this book after reading The Omnivore's Dliema. It is a wonderful pocket guide for the novice as well as the master. I highly recommend this book and it's mothership book "Mushrooms Demystified".
2784	IS ANYBODY GOING TO SAN ANTONE: THIS IS ONE OF HIS BEST..IF THERE CAN BE A BEST, OF ALL THE SONGS HE HAS RECORDED.."ALL I HAVE TO OFFER YOU IS ME' AND "JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME'ARE GREAT ONES ALSO BUT FRANKLY I LIKE EVERY ONE OF HIS SONGS,,THERE ARENT ANY BAD ONES.CHARLEY PRIDE HAS A STYLE ALL HIS OWN AND A BEAUTIFUL STYLE IT IS.HOPE HE PUTS OUT A NEW ONE THIS YEAR. KEEP SINGING CHARLEY AND WE WILL KEEP BUYING..
2785	Ridiculous: Disney = LoveIt is wonderful that they are putting their movies on DVDs now, but really people, don't spend this kind of money on a box set. The most you should be spending on a DVD is about $10, or $20 if you want it right away. I have been buying movies for a while, and the most I tend to spend is $5 on one. This box set has.. what? 9 movies in it? That should be a maximum of $90 in my opinion, and it should be even less since they are boxed together. Save your money. Wait a while and buy them separately.
2786	Favorite baby product, by far!: I got this for my second baby, born Nov 2010. We turn this on whenever it is nap time and it immediately calms him down and helps him fall asleep. It also drowns out noise that my husband and I make, so we don't wake him up. I also use it while my toddler naps to drown out noise. We use it multiple times a day, and I still haven't needed to change the batteries. The noise machine easily comes out of the sheep for easy washing. It gets quite loud, definitely loud enough to be effective for soothing a newborn who is used to the loud womb. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I wish there were an option to not have it automatically shut off. It would be nice for it to stay on for entire naps so I don't wake my kids up in our small house by making noise. I definitely recommend this product! It's my most useful baby item other than swaddling blankets, pacis, and baby carriers.
2787	No help: When I purchased this book, I was expecting to find new ways to improve my communications instantly. What I got from this book was a list of common sense items. Only about 10 % of this book helped. I expected more.
2788	Pathetic Copycat Movie.: This movie is pathetic, not only does it completely change the very nature of anne, But it even has the nerve to steal plot points from other stories and claim them as there own.For instance when Anne goes to live at the poor house the punishment scenes are copycats of Jane Eyre. The standing Anne on the stool and forbidding others to have any contact with her, the cutting of her hair claiming that her hair is the root of the rebellion in her, even the death of a friend in the asylum.This movie is not even worth watching. Watch the movies that they stole from instead.
2789	make your own organic mulch....easily: does a great job once you have it assembled.. the directions for assembling are not real clear and it took a couple of phone calls to the company but finally got it together and now it works great....the people at the company were very nice and helpful.... they should have an online video for how to assemble...call the company and ask them to do this... if enough of us call we can make a difference and for sure make them either do a DVD or a video on line. They are in Malden Massachusetts. (781) 321-2300 J. Howard, Hollywood Hills, Calif
2790	Calhoun is an orginal: Calhoun is an urban storyteller who uses songs to detail small pieces of life. His beautifully textured voice is perfect for his music; hell I'd listen to him read a cereal box. "Hope" is a small piece of music in a big world of dance pop and mega bands, but it's a piece that will stay with you a lot longer and mean a lot more. Maybe because of it's smallness it feel much more personal, much more like a what music might sound like if you wrote about you own life. I am beginning to think that Calhoun is what music is supposed to be like.
2791	Sunwa 7 funstion 16 Range Analog Multimeter: This is another piece of garbage imported from China. Unit worked for about 2 weeks. Do not buy this item for any reason.
2792	If you want to Bust Sugar....Here's your shopping list to do it.: OK You've read Sugar Busters and now know why you haven't lost weight. You're ready to give this a try but what a pain figuring out what and how much to buy. YOU DON"T HAVE TO....this book gives you the shopping list for the food you need to buy. The only thing easier is to have someone deliver it to your door.
2793	Didn't work for me.: Product makes a dusty mess out of the dog's dish and had no noticeable effect on dog's disgusting habit. Also, ingredients are MSG and wheat gluten, not what I remember from the description, but I could be wrong about this. The description did say that the product doesn't work for all dogs; I'm apparently one of the unlucky owners.
2794	Chicago Cutlery not as good as expected: This 10 pc. set only came with 9 knives, which are not nearly as sharp as I was expecting. Also, they do not cut as smoothly as other Chicago Cutlery knives I have used in the past.
2795	Ugggh..............: This is the worst CD I ever heard. I can't stand Pantera, especially Phil Anselmo. I really don't understand how so many people love this noise. War Nerve is probably the worst metal song I have heard in a long time.
2796	Bad product!: Only the box looks nice. The nailclipper is of very poor quality - you have to squeeze hard and yet it did not cut the thumb fingernail - my wife ended up using the scissors which also was not an easy task. It is extremely difficult to pull the tools out of the box - and worse - since two of the tools are pointing upwards you can really cut yourself (my wife cut and bled her finger while pushing the file back down in the box). The only thing that seems to work is the file.Do not buy this product.
2797	Why do I need another copy of this?: Added- 5 whole minutes- Documentary about how to make a great movie suck by making it a Broadway production.Deleted- Karaoke version of five songs from the soundtrack: Hold Me Now, Do You Really Want to Hurt Me, Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, Rappers Delight, White WeddingWorth the extra $13 - I think notI suppose if you are one of the four people on the planet that doesn't own this classic there is a option of which edition to purchase, for the rest of us, it's just not worth it.
2798	If you read romance to be uplifted do not touch this book !!: I don't know why someone would write a romance novel based on Alexander the Great as we all know it ends badly.I also don't know what I was thinking in picking it up, mabey it was the cover, mabey I thought that the couple would be happy in the end before he dies so young and have a happy hopeful ending for the woman.Boy was I wrong !!!If you wish to be deperessed this book is great for you.They are always arguing and never truley work it out right up to the end and the woman goes on to have a depressing and horrible end.If you look at romance novels to have at least a glimmer of happiness at the end don't bother with this.
2799	PHOTO ESSAY ON PLANTING A VINEYARD: A magnificant photo essay of planning and planting a vineyard seen through the camera of a medical doctor, turned wine grower/wine maker. Shows you exactly what it is like from selection of rootstocks, preparation of the site, vine spacing, cover crops, irrigation on through the small lot wine-making process. I think it would be really helpful for anyone interested in growing grapes.
2800	Sony Tcm-210 walkman cassette player/recorder: i don't really want to tell people how great this player really is. if they find out, they might buy them all and then there'll be none left for me to buy. So no - I don't think I want to tell people how great this player really is.
2801	Oh, I think I'll use this todaSPROING!: The thing literally exploded apart while I was extending it one morning. No unusual amount of force or anything. It just flew apart. The cable still works, but the mechanism is in pieces. I would fix it, but I can't even find where the other half of it shot off to.
2802	Fascinating Information!: Wonderful facts, expertly put together in a collage of spooky (or even frightening) but fascinating information. A great read for people of any age. Even if you don't usually like this type of book, you will after reading this portion of the Secrets of the Unexplained series!
2803	Let's apply some common sense: John, let's apply some common sense... If all the watches were as defective as the one reviewer's you cited, then the Tissot T-Touch would not be a successful product line. Every consumer product has its share of lemons - that's just the reality of modern day consumerism. Manufacturing processes are not perfect, and never will be.Having said that, if there were an inordinate number of failures in this product line, then it would be a cause for concern. That just isn't the case. My watch is fine after more than a year...
2804	Theories without evidence: Hogg has a lot of theories about childcare and a lot of Hollywood celebs as clients. What she doesn't have is any good evidence to back up her claims. Some of it may be right, some of it may be wrong, but there is no way to tell from the book. This may be helpful to you and your baby but read it for what it is: the unvalidated opinions of one person based on anecdotal experience, not a proven success nor the guidance of somebody with semi-mystical insights into the minds of babies. (Incidentally, she also exaggerates her formal qualifications and experience).
2805	The best: Of all adaptations of A Christmas Carol, this is the best one. George C. Scott is the perfect Scrooge.
2806	communication problems: I installed the printer very easily, printed my pictures, they were great. So far so good, the next day however I was getting a message saying the pc could not communicate with the printer. I emailed Lexmark tech support, they replied that I should make sure I was using a compatible version of windows and a USB cable!?! Not very helpful. So I reinstalled and it started printing again,for about a week, and then the communication problems again. Called tech support, Rachel told me make sure the printer was plugged into the wall and not a surge protecter. That actually worked, until the next time I went to print.I like the multifunctions of this printer and the pictures did print very good. But the constant communictation problems and poor support really make it a bad choice.I am returning this printer tommorow (only have had it a week -got at a retail store.
2807	A dissapointment: Normally, I like Martin Scorsese's work. I've been a fan of his for quite some time now. He has made many great movies. This is not one of them, however. If you want to see a good Scorsese flick check out Taxi Driver and don't bother wasting time with this pretentious non-sense.
2808	Exceptional book on spiritual development: This book was on my recommended reading list for a human development course, and yet the main course books kept citing it as a resource. I purchased it because I cited often from it directly and truly enjoyed the writing style and spiritual insights viewed through the lens of human development. Loder uses his theoretical perspective to explain the human development stages. For example their are certain spiritual components a grade school child may understand, just as an adolescent may experience a certain level of spiritual understanding. Loder writes almost lyrical at times in expressing spiritual experience at the various life stages, but this is not necessarily a book for the average reading crowd. Some of the theology was beyond my understanding, and some of the theology I did understand, I disagreed with (from my own perspective). However, i would recommend this book for someone approaching pastoral counseling as a career.
2809	Fits my 7 yr olds wrist perfectly.: After looking everywhere for a girl's digital watch, I finally found this one. Very happy with this purchase. I would recommend this to a friend.
2810	BORING: I'm sorry I don't agree with most of the reviewers. Although the book was easy to read, I found it to be slow-moving. I was so excited to finally read it but I couldn't figure out what all the hype was about. I loved the male character in the book, although for the life of me, I can't remember his name. I also loved the bonding that the sisters had. I think the AIDS tragedy wasn't developed enough. This book is one that I'll soon forget about.
2811	These are solid and good looking knobs: They match our home beautifully and are sturdy enough for the price. Great buy. The lock mechanism is smooth and solid.
2812	LOVED IT: This is the best film in my collection. I love historical films. I loved the way they portrayed the main character as a passionate, all consuming, blindly in love (loca)woman. Even after her husband commits infidelity, she loved him. Even after he tried to have her locked away, based on incompetence (insanity), just so he could rule the Kingdom. She still loved him. Even when he was dying from a disease, she still loved him. Very passionate movie. 5 Stars.
2813	Crap: My school buys this book obviously because it's cheap or something. Nobody gets this. The writers are too busy trying to sound intelligent and make themselves look good that they leave everyone behind. It's just crap. They act like your suppose to understand it already and the reason we have the book is to learn.
2814	1880 UNITED STATES CENSUS OF PUTNAM COUNTY, TENNESSEE: The 1880 Putnam County Census is another book on Putnam County that I recommend to serious researchers of Putnam County Genealogy. It is a typed transcription, with index that is easy to use and follow. There is a map of Putnam County for 1880 as well as listings of the 1st - 17th Civil Districts. Information excerpted includes; Dwelling; Family;Last Name; Middle Initial; Color; Sex; Age; Relationship to Head of House; Marriage status; Profession or Occupation; Place of Birth; Fathers place of Birth; and Mothers place of Birth. I have used both the 1870 and 1880 versions of the census that my books are falling apart. They have lots of good information for the serious Putnam County researcher.
2815	Perloff is a bit of a nut!: Even though Mr. Perloff says that politicians using the "communist threat" is a bunch of BS, he is the consumate anti-communist who thinks that only the John Birch Society can save us! There is some info about the CFR that might be valuable, but it's difficult to know what might really be true and what is his personal opinion.It's OK as an intro to the CFR, but the author is still living in the early fifties.
2816	Poor auto focus: I thought I was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos I shot indoors I liked the analog better. Very poor and grainy. Also the focus is terrible! While filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus. I filmed my daughter's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing. Very disappointed with this purchase. I guess it's true what they say. "You get what you pay for" It seems under $600.00 doesn't get you much.
2817	the future of pop music!: I first saw this video on VH1 Soul and I fell in love with not only Thicke, but this song too. It is very funky and upbeat and danceable. Thicke is an amzing songwriter and a great singer, I was able to hear his entire album "Cherry Blue Skies" over the summer and it's awesome too, so please support this talented, but under-promoted singer by buying this single and his album too!
2818	dissapointed: i put the light bulb in, it flickered and then out, did not last, and kind of expensive for a light bulb
2819	It "works": This little fan "works" but for how long? I can't believe how cheaply it is made. Plastic... Nothing but cheap flimsy plastic.Another poorly made product from CHINA. You know... China, the country we sold our souls to.Amazon should require that the country of origin be listed on all products. That would really help me to avoid Chinese made junk.
2820	O my god this is a great book!: I need to by a vowel because O my god this is a great book! It's as funny as Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot (which he is) and is very well researched. It's about time somebody called these unethical blowhards on their slanderous, hateful behavior. It's especially nice to have done in such a clever way. Al Franken is a comic genius. I just can't believe he slept with that horrible Ann Coulter. ;)
2821	Nine lives. . .? here's "Living Proof": Besides being an inspiration for the mid-age set (you don't have to be 21 and practically broke several ribs to like dance music), Cher shows that like fine wine, you do improve with age.Check out "A Different Kind Of Love Song", which guarantee's you come away with a smile and the lyrics stuck in your brain. Other note-worthy's include the hot "Body To Body", the 70's feel of "Love Is A Lonely Place", the anthemic "Alive Again," a great cover of Amber's "Love One Another", and "Song For The Lonely."Acutally, the only cut that sounds like it should've been on "Believe" is "You Take It All. Simply put - she's back and she rocks. If you don't own anything else from Cher, this is it!Cherglamour
2822	buy it before you're due: This book describes what's going on in a child's nervous system from the moment of conception, making it as interesting to read (maybe more) than your favorite pregnancy guide. Eliot has one axe to grind: she argues that it's partly "nature" but mostly "nurture" and proceeds to put fine points of distinctions on the components of those buzzwords.There's not much plain advice in this book, other than to learn a lot about neurobiological development. Eliot does a great job of inspiring interest in the field and then breaking it down to an easy level of comprehension. It's an easy read but a long one--I'm having a hard time keeping up while also keeping up with my new daughter. Has it made a difference in her development? Maybe, but Eliot's book has definitely increased my confidence and patience as a parent. That's something that the raft of know-nothing advice books can't claim.
2823	HARD TO FIND -- C6614AN (HP No. 20): This new-ish ink concept from HP makes GREAT copies and is EASY to install. I should have looked at Amazon.com first ... would have saved trips to five different office supply places, needless wear and tear on my body and my brain, and I would be printing right now instead of leaving feedback. I am thankful for amazon.com EVERY single day of the year!!! (HP products are SWELL, too.)
2824	Disappointed: Since they had Rick Stevens name on this I expected more. You can go to any department store and get the same thing a lot cheaper at the same quality. So small the largest one will only hold two folded shirts.
2825	Fantastic: Another great read from David Liss. I do agree with the other reviewers who say it doesn't measure up to A Conspiracy of Paper, but it is still good enough to get 4 stars from me. I love books in which I learn something while following a really good plot. This is one of those books. If you haven't read Conspiracy, read it first. Then go right to this one. Very good sequel.
2826	Kinda mean..: I have to admit, some parts of this book made me giggle - Bryson's dry humor can be very funny when he isn't turning it against almost everyone he meets along the way.Maybe I'm biased (he skipped most of my home state because he just 'didn't want to be so far south' for any longer), but he spends way too much time making fun of southerners, including a complete plot outline of "Deliverence," which he delivers with assurances that it could well be accurate. Geez, would you treat the natives this way if you were in a foreign country?Get this one at the library.
2827	I still have not received this item. This is my third email what is the deal sheila quinn: I still have not received this item . I have sent emails. What is the deal . sheila quinn
2828	Avoid at all costs.................: If your a shoe salesman and you want to sell shoes the rest of your life, this is the book for you! The key message of this book could have been told to you in a simple 3 page essay. After this authors 1st book, it has been all down hill. He should take his own advice to network himself into another career that doesn't involve advice. THATS HOW HE CAN SHOW HIS "LIFE LONG COMMITTMENT" TO HIS READERS AS HE SUGGESTS OTHERS TO DO TO AN INDUSTRY. It was truly unreadable. I can't even sell it used with a clear conscious.The experience in summary: Imagine, your trying to eat lunch quietly and the banter of two people talking louder than they should be are right next to you. If that is considered a positive experience, than buy multiple copies of this book for your library.
2829	Not very good movie: From the Previews I had seen I thought that this movie was going to be a good one.What I saw made me what to ask for my monie back. I thought that the movie was horrible.The plot is that a woman sees her husband killed in a way that is very bad and she thinks that she is a character on a soap opera that she watches. The plot might have been bariable with better acting, but even Renee Zellweger and Greg Kinnear who are good actors did not do a very good job in this movie.
2830	McAfee Internet Security 4: I bought this as a replacement for Norton Internet Security-what a mistake. First, if you can get it running, it is far from user friendly. Too many screens, too many redundant features. Secondly on my PC (running WIN 98SE), the upgrade feature refused to work. The installshield refused to run. I had an IM session with cutomer support (a somewaht "creepy" experience), and did what they said, which was to delete the installshield folder on my PC and download a new version from MSFT which I did, and it did not solve the problem. So, I have run out of time to mess with this product anymore and am going back to Norton (which had its own issues) but at least ran well and allowed me to upgrade.
2831	My first Blue grass album: I've listened to a bit of blue grass over the last few years, but this is the first total BG album I have purchased. Initially I was a little thrown by Del's voice, as the classic BG style he uses takes a little time to get into. However, it is of couse this style of singing that gives BG part of its power and after a few listens I have come to love this album. Three tracks stand out in particluar - before the fire comes down, high on a mountain and I beleive, these are wonderful songs.
2832	o: you got to be kidding. this chick has a greatest hits album already? She never even had a hit~ She can't sing.
2833	TALK ABOUT DISTORTION: This book gives people who are clueless about hacking the wrong idea. Its points people in the wrong direction and it gives hackers a bad name. Theres only one way to be a good hacker, reading and research. You can't just read one false-titled book and expect to be another Phiber Optik.
2834	Very Overated: I have purchased the CD version of this Radio Series and I have to say that the only worthwile feature of these episodes in the sound quality. Having said that the serial is [very weak].I was so disgusted by it that I have thrown the lot in the dustbin where they belong. a total waste of money if ever.There is no music or intro music to set the mood and pace of the serial and the sound effects are hopeless. As a real fan of both radio and film serials I have to say the Superman Vs. Atom Man is the most useless series I have come accross,... The only reason I have given this CD set 1 star is because I have no choice if I am to get my views on this site.
2835	A Must for Diana Lovers!: These are two wonderful documentaries including footage I've seen nowhere else that faithfully present Diana as she was and should be remembered! Just wonderful movies of her royal family, the Mother Teresa visit, and so much more. Diana a princess of the people; a mother, a wife, and an amazing woman. She remains an inspiration to my 3 daughters, who love this DVD!
2836	James Levine,the Met chorus and orchestra are the stars!: Dmitri Pittas gives a heartrending account in his lead tenor role. Mr. Lucic is a promising Verdi baritone. Ms. Guleghina seems past her vocal prime but gives a harrowing account of Lady Macbeth.
2837	Contains a less aggressive sound than "The Devil You Know": Econoline Crush is one of the few rock/alternative bands I keep up with. In the past they have delivered a unique and refreshing sound, such as the fast and aggressive style with slightly distorted lyrics found on their previous release, "The Devil You Know". Unfortunately, part of that style has been lost on "Brand New History". The overall tone of this album is much more laid back and slower than before, and that will no doubt be a disappointment to some. Once you get past that however, you'll find that there are some fairly enjoyable tracks on "Brand New History". Songs like "Flamethrower", "You Don't Know What It's Like", and "Tomorrow Starts Today" all live up to the quality one would expect from Econoline Crush, and will easily become stuck in your head long after you listen to them. I still believe "The Devil You Know" is by far their best album, but "Brand New History" is certainly worth attention.
2838	Does not work: I got a really good deal on this from Amazon. I had not tried it before and that was my mistake. This stuff has no fragrance but it also does not work. I used twice as much as the regular Downy, and it still did not soften my clothes. I should have bought one bottle locally for trial before ordering a case.
2839	Dance music for a simpler time!: Highly authentic in instrumentation and song selection, put this CD on, close your eyes and imagine attending a colonial country dance. The hornpipes and reels are foot-tapping, and the lack of vocals most welcome.Many recordings of antique music on original instruments become tedious after a bit, but this one is fresh, fun, and exactly how I imagine the tunes would have sounded in their milieu.Congratulations to Old Sturbridge for this superb CD!
2840	Shinin' Bright: Why do I like this album? Because my kids can listen to it. Mos Def & Talib Kweli bring back the feeling of good "social-conscience" lyrics. The beats are up-to-par and *match* the group. The appearance of Common (Sense) on "Respiration" could be considered overkill because they can hold their own.
2841	Straight from her heart and soul!: My Soul Has Spoken by Terri Ann Armstrong is a marvelous compilation of poetry.

2842	I'm stuck buying these until I get a better printer: Now I know why the printer was so cheap..these cartridges don't last long at all, and don't print strong at all..images are light and weak. Lousy cartridges but you get what you pay for, I guess.
2843	boring: Dont waste your money. this guy "mike bonner" is completely boring.I couldent even watch the entire dvd. "its that bad".No wonder its dirt cheap. I should have figured that one out.
2844	More expensive than print and online version: The kindle version of the WSJ is more expensive than the print and online version combined! What a joke! Doesn't the WSJ save print and delivery costs if more customers subscribe the kindle version? Think about it! What a scam!
2845	Attractive way to display tea: I bought this for the waiting room at my office. It is attractive, and I have heard client's comment on how handy it makes tea storage. Also looks way better than having a bunch of boxes of teabags set out. The Stash teabags I also bought look very chic in this box.
2846	Complete bunkum: I'm amazed that intelligent people I know were impressed with this. Menzies' ignorance (certainly) and dishonesty or self-delusion are almost beyond belief. I wish I could give a negative rating. It's so sad that this book has an overall good rating.
2847	wrong -wrong -wrong: Lord Help usI am a follower of Christ. I am not any religion except under Jesus Christ as My Savior. I am feed up with self righteous chritsians.This book is in error. I have turned to Messianic Judasism because I relaize Christians are ignorant. For years my Christian Church ignortantly celebrated Easter and Christmas which are clearly pagan and have nothing to do with Christ or God. Even Pagans themselves wonder why Christians celebrate thier holidays. When I looked into the meaning of these holidays it was clear that no Christian should be involved with bunnies, eggs, Christmas trees. God commands us not to follow the pagan rituals. Christians are wrapped up in thier rich churches and pagan rituals and they are forgetting the true Jesus.I went Messianic so I could follow the way God outlined with the full benefits of having Jesus in my life-This book is bitter and not the truth- Once aganin we have an angry christian spreading lies.
2848	This product is just another shampoo. Nothing special ...: This product is just another shampoo. Nothing special about it. It didn't make my hair soft or shiny. It didn't even smell good. It just cleaned my hair. Nothing else.
2849	Great for the novice: I bought this without ever having built, assembled or even worked on speakers. It guided me and explained everything I needed to build an couple of really hi-end speakers.
2850	Mario Lanza: I love opera, so I have enjoyed all of Mario Lanza's films and Kathryn Grayson's films. I think if he had lived, he would have been a great opera singer. This video shows what he can really sing, and it was very entertaining. I also think that Kathryn Grayson sang beautifully for time that these videos were made.
2851	BROKE in 6 months: This remote seems cool at first - I liked how it plugged into my computer for set up. But I never liked the hard, tiny and slippery buttons. On top of that - it never quite worked right - no matter how much I tried to tweak it. Finally - about 8 months after using it - the LCD screen went blank. Logitech never returned any emails about it and I just gave up. I didn't pursue the warranty issue far as I probably could have because I never liked it much to begin with. That doesn't mean I'm happy about paying $100 for something that broke.
2852	another poor, yet hilarious ninja movie: This movie had my friends and I cracking up for hours. For the first 15 minutes, the fights are fairly well done, and the dubbing is decent, but after that, the movie just falls apart. You can see the strings holding up the fighters in some places, and some of the fights look more like synchronized dances. The plot isn't very clear until you've seen the movie more than once, and it's not very important. As it turns out, the Mafia are the good guys--you see, they only allow prostitution and gambling in Shanghai, no drugs. Definitely watch this movie if you want to see some hilarious, surreal fighting.
2853	sgt.pepper's lonely hearts club band movie dvd: it was great movie ! so happy that dvd movie has closed captioned on it. i am big die hard fan of Bee Gees since 1970's . loved to watch that dvd movie with closed captioned !!!
2854	Cable is junk.: The picture on my TV from my Wii cuts out to black for about a second or so every ten-twenty minutes while using this cable. I don't have a problem with the input on the TV from any other device, only when I use my Wii and this component cable. Best of luck to everyone wanting to save some money. It might be as low as a 2% failure rate given the reviews, but its just some worthless junk to me when it doesn't do its job right. I've died too many times in my platforming games already because the screen blacks out during jumps. I recommend another brand of cable over this junk.
2855	Maybe this is not my type of movie: I feel that this is like a movie that was shot in the 80's. I don't know why but it seems old and past due for me. I have tried watching it on five occasions and have not gotten past the 25 minutes. Too bad. I expected more based on the reviews on here.
2856	Broke 3rd time out, destroyed back of Prius: We bought this for our Prius only a few months ago, the third time out, the strap broke sometime during our drive and dented the hatch and bumper badly (the bikes hung on til we pulled over). Thousands in damage, don't know if Saris is going to help with the damage but BUYER BEWARE!! 2 adult and one kid bike. Terrible terrible rack.
2857	Worst Stand-Up I've Ever Seen: I have no problems at all with material that some might find offensive if it's funny. We need to be able to laugh at ourselves and the world around us. But someone needs to tell Jamie Kennedy that offensive is not automatically funny. There was nothing funny about this act; it was crude for the sake of being crude with no laughs. I'll never watch this comedian again.
2858	Only lasted one year!: Beware -- just as other reviewers experienced, my oven suddenly and irrevokably stopped working, and just outside of its one year warranty. Consider not buying this, because it's possible Sanyo is using defective materials. I went to a local electronics store, and after I described the problem, they said it was likely due to a malfunctioning magnatron and could not be fixed. I agree with the other reviews: it's pretty, it's a good microwave while it actually works, and it doesn't toast well. But the cheap price isn't worth it because I have to replace it after only one year.
2859	Great Movie!!: This is a great movie of the reknowned author/explorer Jack London starring Micheal O'Shea and Susan Hayward.It's a must see!!
2860	disapointed: I am a HUGE Lynn Kurland fan and my only complaint is this book is "TO SHORT"!!! It's only 86 pages what's up with that! I have been waiting months and months for this book and it will take me one night to read the whole thing. Very disapointed.Bigger books please Ms.Kurland!!
2861	Utterly charming!: My two toddler sons and I love these delightful little books full of warm family moments and quirky humor that both children and adults can appreciate. I particularly love the easy style of the illustrations that capture so completely the essence of baby/puppyhood! We hope this writer and illustrator team will create more "Bubba and Beau" books.
2862	Could not finish reading it: I stopped reading the book in chapter 9 but should have stopped earlier. There is no indication that the author can offer novel insights into Tesla, his inventions and contributions to the science and industry of his time. The writing is dry and unimaginative. It is also pretty clear that the author has no deep understanding of electric forces and the devices that harness them. I would love to find a good scholarly biography of Tesla. This book is far from that.
2863	Great while it lasted.: This machine made pretty great espresso for about seven months, and then just crapped out.Kinda like the espresso machine version of a Ferrari- very sexy when it's still new and shiny. And then.... bluh. Time to take it to the shop and see how bad the damage is going to be.Now comes the dilemma: Send it in to get it fixed or buy something more reliable?
2864	Check out what's happening in Japan now.: If Kobo Abe made our ideas of Japanese literature twist and metamorphosize before our eyes like live prawn in hot sauce, then check out these short stories and novel excerpts (including a graphic short novel) from some inventive yet accessible Japanese writers. Note their connection to the rest of the world, the use of Marquez, the notation to Saul Bellow. See where things are going, and you will enjoy them along the way
2865	Cringe-inducing to the max.: Batmand and his erstwhile partner Robin must face the villainous likes of Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Bane. This time, the caped crusader and the boy wonder have another partner, Batgirl! Fourth film in this once lucrative franchise is like Superman IV, it's hilariously awful. George Clooney seems completely out of place as Batman, the dialogue is painful to listen to, the action scenes are badly choreographed, and for some reason director Joel Schumacher decided to film half the scenes on a tilted angle. Garish, unintentionally funny, and unbelievably silly, this is among the worst summer blockbusters to date.
2866	Not good enaugh: I was very disappointed: Very simple, not practical - some analyses and suggestions are almost hilarious (e.g. the interpretation of graphs at the end). No practical background. Of no use for practical challenges.
2867	The Golden Girls - The Complete Third Season: I enjoyed every minute of this DVD. The ladies in the cast are of my generation and I can relate to the situations that they experience. If you're down-in-the-dumps and want to shake off the blues, laugh yourself back to happiness with this Golden Girl DVD.
2868	alice: when i got this in the mail, i was amazed at how beautiful it looked... leather bound, gold edged pages, stunning illustrations. i couldn't wait to dive in to alice's world. highly recommended for any alice in wonderland fan.
2869	Disappointing!: Poor sound and video reproduction. This seems to be a copy or knock-off version of another DVD with the exact same title, which is also for sale on Amazon.This is a great Christmas video but you'd do well to get the original version which is technically superior in all respects.Christmas In New York
2870	Simple but worked well: I purchased this because our vendor mentioned that it would work with Windows 7, and voila, it did. Our previous devices were only compatible with Windows XP and would only work with Windows 7 with an off-normal market driver.We have multiple of these in service now and have had no issues.
2871	Very Poor Customer Service -Item never delivered !!!: It seems that I will never be able to find out if the product is good or bad.They kept on sending the order to wrong addresses and then kept on asking me to re order it again and again.They keep on sending automated messages, and there is no one to handle real problems.I would not recommend dealing with this vendor again.Stick to items that are in Amazon.com stock and keep away from other vendors. You just have no control over sub vendors via Amazon.com.
2872	I couldn't even finish...: Being a huge fan of Jane Austen, I was very excited about reading this. However, the farther I got, the more I felt like I had been "suckered" into reading it because of the title and supposed JA connection. There were some pretty disgusting things in it(and being a college student, I'm not that easily offended either), and I felt like it was not at all true to the spirit of Austen herself to include them. Besides this, most of the characters were about as lovable as Mr. Collins (Allegra especially just irritated the heck out of me!) If it weren't for the fact that this book was given to me, I would feel cheated out of my hard-earned money as well!
2873	Absolutely Horrible: This book is absolutely horrible. I bought this book for my third trip to Europe and it is utterly nerve-wracking and annoying to read and follow. It is very vague and doesn't help at all for planning a trip. Many times it bolds locations without giving any information about them. The restaurant recommendations are also completely useless. Most of the information in the book is just there to fill up pages. Search for another book or look online for places to visit and eat. This book actually made the weeks in Europe WORSE.
2874	Just okay: First time I heard it, I liked it. On subsequent plays, I liked it lesser and lesser to the point that I don't listen to this CD anymore. I just can't. SHK's touch on the sitar is too soft for my liking. I really had to strain to hear his strokes over the drone and tabla (contrast that with the crystal clear crisp note rendition of Ravi Shankar) in the second track. The other issue is that I find his playing to be very repetitive. Particularly when contrasted with someone like Ravi Shankar, whose creative genius leaps out in the way he improvises, in SHK's case, there isn't nearly enough of improvisation. That said, the compositions he plays are truly very beautiful.
2875	Not as good as the first one but good music for entertaining: Great for entertaining / cocktails / dinner party. Stylish and sexy. Just a shame it doesn't quite live up to the first one which is my all-time favorite.
2876	Nothing new or insightful and fell apart as well before I got to page 24!: I have purchased several books on SOX in the last few months (this book, Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 Implementation Toolkit (Ramos), How to Comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 and Information Technology Control and Audit.)If you wish a well written overview of SOX which includes the key aspects and components -- this is a good book. This book will also provide a few basic checklists and worksheets. However, if you are looking for a comprehensive road map for your project, this book will not meet your needs.Unfortunately, this book, like many of the others simply does not provide the level of detail required to get your project going.Additionally, the book is poorly constructed. The book fell apart (literally, the pages falling out) before I made it to page 24. Since I read through the entire book in about 2 hours, I can honestly say that it was not due to misuse.
2877	Garbage: How do you mess a keyboard up? Just arrived today, the 'F', '5', and 'O' keys didn't work. Plugged back in the garbage stopgap keyboard I bought for 10$ from PC Richards (which doesn't require software installation).What a joke.
2878	Don't waste your money: The Indian Avatar wouldn't have any thing to do with a white man who runs a cult.
2879	delivered what was promised: Bought this online after researching several sights. Was excactly what I ordered and delivered what was seen on website. Delivery was on time and within a week after I ordered. No problems putting together, it was very easy. Divider is not as flimsy as others claimed. My 8 week old Airedale has had no problems is a very active puppy and it has not come undone.
2880	Totally ineffective this year: Like many other reviewers I found this product ineffective. After three weeks and two vials there is no visible reduction in my dog's flea infestation. Please read the many recent reviews that support this before you buy.
2881	Harry Potter DVDs: Love the DVDs of Harry Potter...great price, easy to order, came in just a few days. Made a wonderful gift for friend. Thank you Amazon!
2882	Blanchard's books keep getting better!!: Once in a while a reader finds a favorite author whom he/she rushes to the store to buy the newest book solely based on the author. This has happened to me with Al Blanchard. All of his books and short stories are so wonderfully crafted that I know for sure I will enjoy and relish his tales. In his latest, Blanchard has created a mystery based on murders at a public school. The wonderful descriptions of the characters, the way sub-plots are interwoven throughout the story, and the ability in all of us to relate to our school days makes this book a must-read.
2883	Not good: In my view point this is not that good. A lot of trouble. Would not recommend it.It leaked several times and had to keep getting replacements.
2884	Love this for the RV!: This is great stuff! I removed the stock window treatments on my RV and installed this plus lace curtains, so I can enjoy the view, but have some privacy.The only problem is, I have dogs, and despite my very best efforts, some dog hairs got stuck between the glass and film, and it is pretty obvious if you look closely at the windows from the outside.
2885	Pretty dull: The worst thing about this CD is that most songs are alike and you don't realise when one ends and the other begins as they all sound the same. The best song is Au Haut Du Mat. L'assistant Parlementair is also quite good. i always skip the first two songs though. Obviously, the other reviewers disagree with me. The CD is full of guitar and the singer more reads the lyrics than sings them. So i would rate the CD as "cautious, please be careful".
2886	The Man Who Read the Good Book: The Man Who Ate the 747, written by Ben Sherwood, is about J.J. Smith and his adventure with a little town in Nebraska called Superior. J.J. Smith works for the World Record book. He witnesses the records being broken. While looking over world record attempts, he saw one letter saying that a man is eating a 747. J.J. takes on the caseI recommend The Man Who Ate the 747 it is a very exciting book that I couldn't put down. The book was unlike most books I have read because it was filled with many twists. The chapters ended was so much suspense that I had to read the next chapter. I would read this book until I lose my mind!Aanand's BMS Literary Corner
2887	I paid $0.99 for it and couldn't watch more than 15 minutes: OMG, this is one of those movies that I rented because I was curious to see if it was as bad as I thought it would be. Well the answer is I downloaded it to watch on Amtrak, and in the end I found watching traffic on I-55 more interesting than this movie.
2888	Good product: I got it for my son. I can't say first hand how it works or anything really. He seems to like it.
2889	This is not the REAL Dog Whisperer: Like others, I purchased this DVD thinking it was Cesar Millan. It was misleading because I searched Amazon on Cesar Millan's name and this was the second result to come up. We figured we'd watch the DVD anyway since it was my mistake. First of all, the formatting of this DVD is extremely annoying and choppy. Secondly, I'm not sure that I agree that feeding treats to my dog until she explodes is really the best way to train her. Third, it said something about puppy training in the title and I couldn't find ANYTHING on the DVD about puppies at all. Could be it's there and I just lost patience before I got to it. I DO NOT recommend this DVD at all.
2890	WARNING!!!!: This toy is DANGEROUS!!!!!! My daughter got it when she was 10 months old and immediately tried to pull up on it and pulled it over on top of herself. It landed on her face. She loves it so I continue to let her use it while guarding her very closely. She also cut her lip on it during another fall, which I guess really could happen with anything that she pulled herself up on but the base isn't strong enough to keep them from pulling it over on herself. She will continue to use it but only when I am right next to her until she is more stable standing up.
2891	I don't know what to say ;-l: I have a theory that you can tell how bad a movie is going to be, based on the trailers that come before it. When I saw some bad trailers at the beginning of this dvd, I knew I was in for a bad movie and I was right. To be honest, it's hard for me to write this review because I don't get what the movie was about at all. Not only could I not follow it, I wasn't actually interested in following it even if I could. I normally love Bruce Willis and Halle Berry and when I knew that Gary Dourdan was in it too, I really wanted to watch this, but none of these actors could change the fact that this is a weak plotted movie that doesn't thrill or excite. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't bought this. I wouldn't even tell my friends to watch it on free to air tv.I'm sorry to say that I thought this movie sucks. Right from the start and even to the 'thrilling and twisting' end, I couldn't have disliked a movie more.
2892	Rush: I am used to listening to Rush in their older years but this is one of their earlier albums. despite the fact that Geddy Lee's voice could go extremely high back and I'm used to the newer stuff they are still freakin' awesome.
2893	Defective Out of the Box: Unit excessively buzzed on every channel and even after following directions to get a full battery charge. Expected much better quality from JVC
2894	Great little radio: This is a good little radio with lots of great features. It's smaller than I thought it would be. One night we heard the alarm going off with an Amber Alert for a missing child. We thought that was pretty cool to receive those types of alerts as well. (We didn't expect that.) It's easy to set it all up and it's a very handy little thing to have around.
2895	My cats love this.: My cats love this product. The slightest whiff of it causes them to beg with frantic meows. This is a great product if you'd like to train your cat(with a clicker and a pointer). It's a lot of money for 21oz of chicken though, so it loses one star :(
2896	An Utterly Forgettable Story....: I'm a big fan of LG, but I can only remember the cover picture & the bare plot of this book & nothing else bcs. this was an utterly forgettable story....
2897	Not happy because of..: I was happy when I bought this, as this is very compact and useful to play both casette and dvd. But sooner, the casette player stopped working if I hookup the LCD monitor (I am thinking that this is because of the power input is not sufficient to play both LCD monitor as well as Casette). However, I can play DVD and view it in the LCD monitor.If I do not use the attached LCD monitor, but redirect the output to a regular TV, then Casette works with out any problem.When I contacted Audiovox (at probably 13th or 14th month), they told it is not covered under warranty so the flat price is around 100 dollars (did not remember exact amount), plus shipping charges.So, did not opt to repair it and kept quiet.
2898	Ramon Pane An Account of the Antiquities of the Indians: An excellent job of narrating the recovery of lost material from existing documentation. The footnotes are well researched. The topic is fascinating, and the insights of the editors very useful. However, I would have liked to see an additional index with entry using English terms as well as the existing index of Taino words.In addition, in analysis of a culture so intimately linked and so knowledgeable of nature as the Tainos, one should also take into account biological reality. For instance, it seems clear to a biologist that Mácocael, "he of the lidless eyes:' page 6 of the text may well be the great rainbow boa, Epicrates spp., Ma-ja, the great snake, since this serpent, like most boas, has lidless eyes.
2899	dimensions?: Does anyone know the dimensions of this pool, nothing is listed in product description anywhere? Is it still a nice pool even though some cannot get it folded up?
2900	Netleme sorunu var.: Isiklandirmanin iyi olmadigi yerlerde netlik sorunu oluyor. Birde floresan isik altinda beyaz dengesi tam tutmuyor. Diger ozellikleri gayet guzel. Bellek kartina cekim yapabiliyor olmasi cok guzel.
2901	Best book of the last several years!: I would say that this is one of the best books I've read inthe last 5 years or so...perhaps since "Secrets of the Temple"was published.I had the privilege of meeting and hearing Mr. Moore speakduring his recent book tour.This author really "gets it" and understands TOTALLY what isgoing on in America today and he figured it all out WITHOUTa college education!Michael Moore is one of those rare innate intellects who hasthe ability to tell very serious subject matter in a cleverand very funny way....READ THIS BOOK...and give it to a friend.
2902	Barney Haters Avoid: This movie is fine for children, but not for Barney haters. Possible that even Barney fans will hate this.Crazed Barney Fan (teen) - 7/10Crazed Barney Fan (kid) - 9/10Barney Fan - 6/10Barney Hater - 2/10Adult - 3/10Newbie Fan - 7.5/10Me - !?What was the MPAA rating people thinking? This shouldn't be rated G, it should be PG, PG13, R or even maybe NC-17! Anyways, this movie sucks. Your toddlers will enjoy, some scenes were ok, but just kinda stupid.
2903	Clueless times five: Well, the girls were nice to look at. They weren't too bright and it took forever to get to the house where all the action was to take place. I don't see this one ever making anybody's must-see list. In fact, it was so slow moving that it was hard to sit through the whole thing. I did however, and the climax was much like the rest of the film...slooow. It lacked any kind of impact and then two words popped up on the screen that said: "The End" and I thought 'Really? That's it?" The bottom line is, this film is watchable but not fun in any way at any level. If you must watch it, rent it. You probably would only watch it once anyway.
2904	Great for Quiet Time in the Classroom: I really like these types of movies. They are not really movies, but more like the story book is animated. They are short and you can choose the option of "read along" subtitles. I use these videos in my classroom during quiet time after lunch. We watch them every Thursday and the kids enjoy the stories. I sometimes also hold discussions about what we watched, similarities, differences, compare, contrast with a venn diagram etc. I thought it was a worth while buy.
2905	A Movie that would make Ed Wood proud: Where to start??...Was it just the concept of taking L. Ron Hubbard's bombastic overwritten "War & Peace" length novel and bringing it to the big screen, the horrible make-up and costumes, the insultingly childish dialog, or what truly may be John Travolta's most pathetic performance ever, or a combination of all the above to make what without a doubt may be the worst "sci-fi" movie since "Plan 9 From Outer Space." At least "Plan 9" was made with the best of intentions. "Battlefield Earth" is dreadful...tiresome to watch, a plot that goes nowhere, script-writing straight out of 2nd Grade classroom and a Vinny Barbarino-esque main character, Terl, that is just painful to watch. This trash needs to be locked away with a sign that reads "Open Only In Case of Glitter Pt. 2"
2906	Interesting Story: This is a good movie because of its interesting characters. Some of what takes place is not for younger kids and I could of passed on it myself.. But the story of the miners and what they faced in the mines and also the story of the Dr. and his wife coming all the way from India to practice medicine make for an interesting story line.
2907	Needs to be more durable: As a child, I loved MLP's. I thought it would be a great toy for my little girls as well. I was a bit disappointed at the durability. The paper pieces need improvement as well - I have chosen not to give those pieces to them. Nevertheless, they love to play anyway. I still have a few MLP's from my childhood collection and have added to their collection. If only the playsets were more sturdier. Off I go to hot glueing........
2908	first hand account of Herr soldier on the eastern front: I found this first hand account of fighting on the eastern front behind a Pak (anti-tank gun) interesting. The narrative could get monotonous at times, which reflected down time at the front. I got a better idea of what fighting was like in the southern and Crimean fronts and what Germans' experienced in the Soviet POW camps after the war.That there was no index was a letdown since I like to look up many of the persons and events for future reference.I sensed that Bidermann was a soldier doing his duty, not a Nazi. He was caught up in the turmoil of the times and was just trying to survive.
2909	Versatile Pill Boxes: These pill boxes are versatile. I bought them to use individually in my purse just to carry extra pills. They are small enought to not take up a lot of room and the lid closures are secure.
2910	Really pretty good: This actually my second favorite O.C. mix after 1. I ended up liking some of these covers more than the originals. My favorite is Can't Get It Out Of My Head, other goods ones are I Turn My CAmera On, Into Dust and Float On.
2911	Doesn't Last too long!: This item smelled really good when I opened it. But the good smell only lasted for about a week at most. I will not buy again! The label says it lasts up to 30 days. NO it last about 7 days!
2912	Athan does it again.....: GUIDE TO COMPANION PARROT BEHAVIOR is a great overview of this family and specifically provides something the specialty books only hint at, a good cross - comparison of the various parrot members from the "Old World", the "New World" and the "Pacific Rim". I have 12 parrots and three canaries and find there are differences among and between them. Some are more shy (Parrotlets), some are more agressive (Love Birds), some can stand cold (Quakers) and some must be kept warmer with individual heaters or lights. Some are unreasonably sweet (Cockatiels) and some are little devils.Of course Athan might say she never met a companion bird that was a little devil. It is probably true that most anti-social behavior in companion parrots that were hand raised is bought about because the human failed in some way. Athan show the reader how to establish and maintain a happy relationship with your companion bird and how to deal with the problems of feather chewing, screaming, and biting.
2913	A One Hit Wonder From The 70s: Daddy's little girl is just that, a little girl with a big mouth brother. She is and will be a one hit wonder, like all the others from the 50s, 60, and 70s.If it wasn't for her Daddy's VH! "B-list" show and money, there would be no CD, no contracts. Like I said a B list one hit wonder. And I wonder how she would of done it with out her BIG Daddy's money.
2914	MORE SAD THAN COMEDY: This movie was such a good movie. But from the preveiws, it looked like it was a comedy. But when I saw it, it was actually more of a drama.It was about a man and a womanwho are engaged to be married. But the woman has to meet his family. When they get there, the family doesn't give Sarah Jessica Parker(girlfriend)an exact warm welcome. They are actually really mean to her. And alot of stuff happens besides that. The brother likes her. The sister doesn't. The mother is hiding a secret from her family which causes chaos. The father doesn't know what to do. And she just feels really unwelcome. Now I'm not going to ruin the movie for you and tell you what makes the movie sad. but this movie isn't really a comedy either. It's more drama. I do recommend it to anyone who likes a sad, but great film. Yup, this was a real tear-jerker.
2915	wish someone whould've run ME through with a spear...: I didn't know what I was looking at on the screen half the time or why the characters where in the places and positions they were in. Or maybe I just didn't care. It was hard to tell. I can't remember ever being this bored in a movie in my entire life. 2 hours of lackluster story and action where choreographed men were jabbing each other with cheap sticks just to see 15 minutes of stunning visual effects and fighting.Not worth it. Don't buy this movie.
2916	An entertaining look into the life of an exceptional artist.: A wonderful book -- it didn't give everything away yet in so many ways it was so revealing. You have to love, appreciate and respect Toller for who he is and the experiences he's had. He's a warrior dressed in thousands of sequins! A most entertaining book.
2917	Awesome....will continue to buy: These are wonderful seeds and life-savers at that. I had stopped smoking on Jan. 1st and needed to pick up a healthy snack...and..these pumpkins seeds worked like magic!! I limit myself to 1 bag a day and have been through several cases since. I see that they are out of stock and I hope by the time I finish these next 12 packs, they will be back in stock. They are wonderful and addictive!!
2918	My wife is Very happy: This particular pillow is wonderful because it is not cumbersome or too large to manage yet does everything my wife needs it to do. I hardly know this pillow is in bed with us, and when I do notice it I can't help but to think of how nice and soft it is. A great thing about the main squeeze is it is so versatile. The pillow can be twisted and bent into any desired position. This is a great product and I highly recommend it to all who are looking for something that will support all legs, pregnant belly, and face and hands. One nice thing I forgot to mention is because it is sleek my wife has no problem turning with it when she feels the need to be on her other side.
2919	Small is the size of a Large: Ordered slicker brush in a size small, thinking it would be smaller than the brush my husband had purchased in a size large at the local farm store. When I received the brush it was the same size as the large. Will not return due to the shipping charge. Still too large to use on a teacup yorkie. Still looking for small slicker brush. Disappointed in size. Also it claimed to be a soft slicker brush, but the only thing soft was the handle, and it was rubber coated.
2920	Horrible!: Read The Triumph and the Glory, or read Exodus again, or even try one of Oprah's books, but under absolutely no circumstances should you venture remotely near this book. It is bad, bad, bad.
2921	Amazingly Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!: This movie was amazingly wonderful. Im not going to sit here and write about what its about, read the synopsis above or watch it if you really want to know. The cast was perfect for every role they played, the storyline was totally excellent. I usually get bored in the 1st 5 minutes of a movie because i know from the get go its going to suck. Well this one sucked me right into it. I totally loved it from beginning to end, it just keeps you wondering whats going to happen next, not predictable that's for sure. WATCH IT ITS AWESOME .......................
2922	All I Can Say Is Wow!: This book is a roller coaster--a fascinating and really touching story that actually shows the human side of a big-city hospital. I think every parent would want to read this.
2923	Rockbottom quality: The only person who should buy this product is someone that wants the cheapest unit possible. Change the apsect ratio to 4:3 and use 640x480 pictures. It's a repurposed video display. Forget 7" it is only about 5" once you are at 4:3 which is the only usable setting unless you like spending endless hours. Forget the math. it will never work unless you don't mind your pictures being cropped. You will be dissapointed if you know anything about the words resolution or aspect ratio. They really could do better. Should cost $49.
2924	Too terribly sad: I loved this book up until about half way through. It was such a pleasure to read about the characters. They were so interesting. But their sad situations got worse and worse, culminating in a most horrible tragedy that had me sobbing as I finished the book. A well written story but too depressing and utterly sad.
2925	Very dissapointing: I bought this scooter for my six year old,unfortunately some nuts fell apart roughly 4 months after, all efforts to fix it prove abortive. I really like the features, but it did not last.
2926	Kudos!: I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theatre, and I've continued to love it over the years in its DVD format. My ONLY complaint about it, in fact, is that it does not have subtitles! Even though it is in English, it's in ENGLISH-English, and as an American I frequently find it hard to understand films coming from the British Isles. I miss much of the dialogue and that's a shame, because in such an enjoyable movie you want to catch every word. But buy it anyway.
2927	Don't like his style: Ok well I listen to alot of rap and heard different styles, but Mc Frontalot just doesn't work for me. It seems like he pauses a little after every word he says which doesn't make the rap flow. And the music from most of the tracks is ok, would be better if he actually rapped to the beat of the music. I give this album 2 stars for the humor and decent music.
2928	blah: Jolie looks like a giant creepy fish and i'm not sure why I watched all of two seconds of this.
2929	Ratchet Lopper: I already own one and it is the best lopper made. My wife can use it anywhere with ease. With the telescoping handles she can reach to tallest branches with ease.
2930	This is THE book on the subject: Seriously, the title says it all. It is a gem of another era, and an amazing piece of both maritime history and Americana.
2931	12,000 BTU Window Air Conditioner: I bought this to replace a 2-1/2 yr. old Haier A/C which had failed. This unit is quieter, makes more cold air, and is energy star rated. It also has a remote control which acts as a remote temperature sensor. This means that the unit keeps the temperature much more constant. It also allows you to bring in outside air, or not, at your choice.Overall I am extremely satisfied with this air conditioner.NOTE: After a month or so it started emitting a disturbing odor. I threw it away and bought a second one. It did the same thing after a while. I think this may be a leak of refrigerant. Unfortunately I no longer recommend this product.
2932	The Method of Volume Averaging (Theory and Applications of Transport...: An excellent book, with the clarity that characterizes those who writes Professor Whitaker. Irreplaceable if you want to teach well transport phenomena.
2933	A wonderful French movie with a beautiful actress!: Isabelle Adjani again takes on a role of the rejected lover. This is the true story of Victor Hugo's daughter Adele, who enamoured of a military man, follows him to Halifax and refuses to accept his rejection. She does a fine job of depicting a young lady who has gone off the edge. The story is reminiscent of her portrayal of Camille Claudel, another excellent movie. Isabelle Adjani is beautiful to look at and does a fine job of portraying Adele. I enjoyed this film very much. For those who do not understand French, there are moments when English is used throughout the film. The subtitles do justice to the French.
2934	Too Bad...: I have read all of Christine Warren's books. I was anxiously awaiting her new book. Usually I read her books in one sitting. This book was bad. I can't get past the first chapter. Give me the old books, You're so Vein or the Big Bad Wolf. They were really some great books. Bring back the old characters like Graham Winters or Dima or Misha.I guess I should never have started The Black Dagger series- now they are some real romance stories!!!!
2935	ZylissSusi DeLuxe Garlic Press: My first garlic press, and a winner! I researched these and think this is the best. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and I use it daily or more! You don't have to peel the garlic before pressing and it will still work just fine. I have arthritis in my hands, and I still have the strength to press the garlic, and it comes out perfect every time. I do find that to keep the holes in the head of the press clean that it helps to run a vegetable brush over the outside. Seems like there is always one piece of garlic that wants to plug a hole. But overall, I'm completely satisfied and won't be without it EVER AGAIN! Regrets? That I didn't buy it sooner!
2936	The Best Concept Album: Billy Bragg and Wilco have captured Woody Guthrie's spirit in an evocative and spare album of folk songs from America's past. The songs are so spookily perfect that you could swear ol' Woody is in the studio with the band, engineering the sound. This CD belongs in your collection. You will play it at least once a day.
2937	WORST GAME EVER: If I could give this game a rating lower than one star, i would. If anyone gives this game a good review, it's because they don't know anything about first person shooters, and they're still caught up in the fact that it's James Bond and they haven't realized the game they're playing [stinks] yet. This game has difficult controls, sub-par graphics, and a horrible auto-aiming feature, making it near impossible to kill anyone. Also, when you do strike one of the ... AI in this game, it will have little or no effect. You'll find yourself unloading a whole clip to off one guy. This ...fest is broken up every few stages with a car level, which are much, much more fun than the FPS stages, but it is still no excuse for the circular piece of dung that is Agent Under Fire. It'll cost more, but if you're looking for something like this, go pick up Halo and Spy Hunter. Otherwise, hitting yourself on the head with a tackhammer is more enjoyable than playing this game.
2938	Great: I'm a realtor and this is an excellent first time homeowners book. It tells it like it is. Buying a home is more then signing papers, that is only the beginning. Buy this book!
2939	Anne The Action Hero: I was greatly disappointed with this movie. They might as well have called it 'Anne The Action Hero'. Instead of staying true to Lucy Maud Montgomery's story, Anne and Gilbert go off to the war, the war their children were actually fighting. Instead of seeing Anne and Gilbert settle into family life with their children, the writers instead made up this crazy movie with so many plots and basically a lot of chaos. It was so sad to watch this movie knowing that they had officially ruined the Anne of Green Gables trilogy. Sadly too, the movie was made so many years after the second one that Anne looks very aged. It would have been much more appropriate to follow her family life and watch her children growing and all the great adventures they had.
2940	Fun: I have watched several times- reminds me alittle bit of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I guess I would call it silly - glad to not have bad language and moderate with the sensual - no sex scenes.
2941	The only perfume I have loved.: This is by far my favorite perfume. I am the woman who looked, but could never find a perfume I loved. I looked forever and this is what I found. Rich floral scents, citrus and bergamot. An added bonus is that it drives my husband crazy, 7 years and counting.
2942	Awful: First of all, I chose this blender because another reviewer mentioned that the insides of the cups are smooth - not true. I kept it anyway, and after less than 10 gentle uses, the cup got stuck in the base while it was blending. I called Sensio Customer Service and was told that sometimes when you're blending ice, a vacuum is created. (Isn't ice blending one of it's major uses?) They suggested I heat it up with a hairdryer to break the vacuum. No luck. Then they suggested I break the cup (no suggestions on how) to break the seal. I drilled a hole in it and still no luck. Then they suggested I return it to Amazon (though I was past the typical return window). Amazon was more than kind in accepting it. Bottom line is this - the blender is nothing special when it works, it breaks easily, and Sensio Customer Service is a joke.
2943	Not An Island - Cheap Back: We were attracted to the appearance, size, use of hardwood and shape of this piece and expected high quality from Michael Scott.From three sides, it is a very attractive piece. However, the back side is a cheap piece of plywood that is stained in a different color from the rest and has no grain or antique finish to match the rest of the piece. Because it is supposed to be a kitchen island, this cheap side is always visible.In our case, the back side plywood did not fill the space leaving an opening. A replacement is being shipped to us. Also the overall fit of the entire unit was not quite square so it does have some minor flaws with fit.We are very disappointed because it had such great potential to meet our needs.
2944	the maintenance man: if i had not read the book before seeing the play i would not had brought the play. i did not enjoy the play, because there is no way a play can give you what a book or movie can tell you. the book was good it gave you food for your imagination. the movie when made will only give you more food for thought. i would not suggest buying the play. i would suggest buying the book and go see the movie when it come out.the movie is going to be made this year or next if they have not started on it already.
2945	Exceptional: Excellent show! Great watch for anyone who is a Civil War buff or history buff. Great characters, acting and script. Can't wait for next season.
2946	Tedious and Smug: The author labours under the assumption that he is the second coming of Marcus Aurelius, thanks to the publication of a mediocre work in a minor and rather pointless academic firld.He's not.
2947	Bracket mount sucks: The lock is OK, but you have enough frustrations in life without having to play with bracket mounting screws that are just a tiny bit to short. Another 1/16th of an inch would have made all the difference. I guess if you are King Kong you could squeeze to post clamp tight enough to manage a few turns into the nut, maybe, but why bother? Just buy Kryptonite. If you think I'm being picky, consider: if they can't get something that simple right, what else did they mess up?
2948	Worse than bad: This book has the worst description of the OSI model that I've ever had the misfortune to read, and I've seen a few.I am seriously considering dropping a network class for the sole reason that it uses this book as the text book.In all fairness, I should mention that I've only read one chapter. That's all I'm likely to read.
2949	Best "how-to" reference book I have seen. Must have.: I looked for this book on the recommendation of a co-worker. I read the reviews prior to purchasing, but reserved judgement until I saw it myself. I must agree with everyone else that this is the best "how-to" book for any Unix Systems Administrator. The book gives practical answers in simple form for just about every situation a typical SA would run into. I put it to use from the first day I got it! Being new to Unix, I'm glad I have this as a reference book.
2950	Very versatile: These are wonderful cabinets. I have 5 now between the basement and garage. One for paint supplies, one for art supplies, one for gardening, one for my outside Christmas things in the garage. Easy to assemble, no tools, pieces just snap together; by now I can do it in a few minutes. Shelves are adjustable; in my art closet, I omitted 2 of the shelves and can stand the 20x30 matboards up and still have 2 shelves for my tape gun, etc. And the shelves easily hold plastic boxes for organizing even further. Well worth the price.
2951	Disappointing Installment: This game has trouble with plot continuity and storyline. I finally finished the game, after many starts and stops. I had to repeat battles over and over in order to win them. The difficulty level was either too easy or too hard. The beautiful graphics are the only redeeming factor.
2952	Very good show; picture quality acceptable: SInce there doesn't seem to be much out there on DVD of Mink Deville, i was pretty excited to finally get to see something by them, given that they were a bit before my time. This show is from 1982, and while i don't think it has the original lineup, this incarnation is very good and plays tight. Willy is in fine form vocally, sounding like a more soulful Dylan, including the terrific cover of "Stand By Me". My main (really, only) complaints with the DVD are that i wish it were longer (it clocks in a bit over an hour) and the picture quality is sometimes a bit flat and/or not totally sharp, but i chalk that up to technical limitations of the source tape, owing to technology available at the time. No big deal - the sound is very good on this, and there is a generous set list.
2953	Brilliant Magic: The best word to describe this movie is, magical. To enjoy it, one must suspend reality for a bit and simply, let it work it's magic on you. The story begins with two parents looking down to Cady, who is presumably, sitting on a porch, as they give her a packed lunch, some milk money, and a handwritten copy of her telephone number. Cady is being dropped off at a bus stop, where she nearly gets hit and we see her begin to approach the schoolhouse. She enters her first class, Art, and the movie takes off from there.
2954	top heavy and does break: we have used duck tape to keep the top from continuing to fall over, what everyone else says is really true, it does break, i would not purchase it again.
2955	too late to return it, sigh: This is in the Hammacher Schlemmer catalog, so I thought it would be the best. Toast comes out overdone on top and with lines, as another reviewer noted. Eggo waffles get hard but not browned. And it takes up a lot of counter space. I'll try the Breville -- they make a great blender.
2956	Electric BBQ ?: Electric BBQ?, it has never worked, and probably never will. Fire and smoke create the idea enviroment for grilling.If you took it tailgating, where would you plug it in?Stick to Charcoal or gas in my opinion if you are serious about grilling.
2957	INSPIRING: I GOT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON (10YRS OLD) WHO ALSO HAS EARNED HIS BELTS .. MY SON AND GRANDSON VIEW THIS MOVIE 5TIMES WEEKLY TOGETHER .. CAN'T GET ENOUGH .. SO MANY MESSAGES AND THOUGHTS ONE CAN HOLD ON TO THROUGH LIFE .. I TOLD MY GRANDSON THAT WHENEVER MATTERS ARE NOT RIGHT IN HIS LIFE WITH HIMSELF AND OTHERS, WATCH THIS MOVIE .....
2958	I adore anything from Swami Satchindananda: I feel a connection with Swami Satchindananda, I happened to meet probably one of the only people in my area that was blessed to be under his direct teachings. Anything I have read from him comes from a very humble and peaceful place, and helps me to stay focused in my humble and peaceful place.
2959	What was that?: This is not at all what I expected. I can't believe this is from a John Hagee book. I just didn't make much sense to me. Maybe I just didn't get it. I am willing to try another one of his movies for good measure. All is not lost, yet.
2960	Disappointed!: I am very disappointed in the shoe itself, and also the seller's policy. One of the shoes (right) fits great and has no issues, but the other (left) is totally messed up! The toe strap is so tight my foot barely makes it in, and there is no way in hell I could use these!!! I wanted to exchange them but the return policy is 30 days, and with my busy lifestyle I wasn't able to get them back in time, and now I am stuck with shoes I can do nothing with! =( Not happy.
2961	Husband can't wait to play!: This is a Christmas present for our 5yr old. Both my husband and I loved this game as children and we're sure our daughter will too. My husband keeps bugging me to play it after our daughter goes to bed! Perfect storage container when not playing also.
2962	Love it, or Hate it: Loved it, the first day. Hated it ever since. Right out of the box, it worked like a champ, sounded good, used my wife's skyfi2 in it, no problems. Used the skyfi2 receiver it came with in the car the next day, again, no problems with the XM receiver, but the boombox is dead. If you turn the volume UP ALL THE WAY, you get a little pop and crackle, thats it. sounds like the internal amps are blown. It does this with CD/FM/XM. Returned it to place of purchase, I've been waitting two weeks for a replacement to come in. During that time, I'm reading reviews and understanding why its taking so long. It does appear to be a MAJOR problem that Delphi should own up to. I'm not the only one with sound problems.
2963	Beautiful photos, inspirational: I've bought three books from this series; the photos are great to inspire you and the lighting set-ups start from simple natural light and move to more complicated, multiple lights. Tells type of lighting used, camera, film, ISO, lens and f-stop and shows diagrams of the set-ups.The only reason I don't give it a 5 is that they make it look a little too easy...you know, you have angelina jolie come over for an hour, you stick her in a doorway with some natural light on her face, snap a few frames, and voila! perfectly lit portrait.
2964	Camo Hat: Hat is uncomfortable, itchy. The mosquito netting obscures vision. Probably very good for hunting. Delivery was very slow despite the expensive charge effectively doubling the cost of the hat. I suggest you buy a net only and put it on a hat you like. No bugs get in though which is why I got it.
2965	Pfaltzgraff glasses: I received several sets of these glasses and thought that maybe they were defective because they broke so easily. I purchased more and found that it is just poor construction. The lovely colors on the bottom of the glass match the dishes so beautifully, but if they last long enough without breaking, the color washes away leaving a plain clear glass. It is sad that such lovely glasses with a brand name attached to them, don't hold up well under everyday usage.
2966	Very very small!: My kitty is small and it is way too tiny for her to lay on! It might be a good concept but I don't know why it's soooo tiny...
2967	the best of parenting magazines: I have a subscription to four different parenting and baby magazines: Parents, Parenting, Babytalk, and American Baby. This is my favorite. I seems to be the most informative and the topics are presented in Parents long before Parenting every gets around to it. For example, Parents had a indepth article on new discoveries in miscarriages and the following month parenting ran a similar article, but was not as informative and obviously was a steal from Parents. There are also great contest. There are also topics that parents can send in comments about and actually get paid for them if published. All I can say is that this is the only magazine I need and will not be renewing the others.
2968	For the price- unmatched: This is a wonderful scanne, loads of detail, with little shadow noise. The negative carriers and software are a bit fiddly, but the results are good with a little playing with the defaults. With a little looking, you can find this for a great ... price.
2969	An essential guide to anatomy: Last's Anatomy is first and foremost a TEXTBOOK of anatomy. It does not pretend to be an ATLAS of anatomy as some readers find on opening it. The textual content is clinically relevant and maintains the highest degree of accuracy along with well thought out prose in describing essential facts in anatomy along with clinically relevant pearls. As a Clinician I am still amazed at how many of those pearls come into use on a daily basis on rounds and in clinic. Coupled with McMinn and Hutchings excellant Atlas this text should provide all needed instuction in Anatomy for medical students and residents alike.
2970	The Sleepers' Less An Object Cd: This is absolutely THE best cd that I have heard in a very long time. The Sleepers' music is dark, powerful and, at times, disturbing. The vocals of Ricky Williams are highly unique,intense and personal. As well, the guitar style is jagged and dissonant with psychedelic overtones. If you like Second Edition era Public Image or Joy Division than this is the band for you!!
2971	Actually liked it better than the first one: I read "The Sparrow" & "Children Of God" back to back, and I seem to be the only one who thought the second one was better. I thought Sparrow just kind of glossed over everything at the end. Once I read "Children Of God", I saw why; she obvious was saving most of the details for the second book. If these two books had been written as one, I would probably have been my favorite of the year.
2972	4 for 3 DEAL, ONLY $9.99: Got this during the 4 for 3 deal. So, got 8 mugs (4 sets) for only $30. Great Deal.
2973	Going South: Great Movie! "Take it easy Toffield, you're wrinkling up my good luck bandana"! Gotta love it! I watched it three times.
2974	Faulty call log feature: The call log feature of this phone worked unpredictably. Sometimes, calls from a particular number would be logged, while other times, calls from the same caller would fail to appear in the log. Siemens recommended that I replace the base unit, which I did. This failed to correct the problem. They recommended replacing the base unit again. Instead, I just returned the whole phone system. In addition to the call log problems, the phone also often made an unusual clicking noise during telephone conversations.Amazon[.com] was extremely helpful throughout this whole process and I give Amazon[.com] five stars for their customer service. Unfortunately, I wish I could say the same for the Siemens phone.
2975	E=effort: Mick Jones' vocals,as a previous reviewer noted, may be limited.However, they're not the worst. B.A.D. was not an opera group project. Their sound was unique and different with their edgy blend of pop-rock,reggae, some faint punk-ska and various audio samples.There was a definite underlying tone of the Clash (Mick Jones) with a more pop vein geared towards a tamer version of the Red Hot Chili Peppers without crossing into Beastie Boys territory. You have to admire a group of guys who did take experimental bounds and leaps to create a unique and different sound that did not fit the typical new romantic or new wave format drowning the airwaves during that time period !
2976	Somewhat watchable...: After hearing all the bad hype about this movie, I saw the DVD just to satisfy my curiousity.It was watchable. Some good action scenes but the acting wasn't much to write home about. A good enough movie to watch on a slow night.There's a great piece of dialogue by John Travolta in the very beginning about why Hollywood movies suck, then the movie takes it a step further and ends up proving its own point.It's nowhere near as bad as Wing Commander, though.
2977	Good book!: Great plot with memorable characters. Good unsuspected ending! Recommended for easy and enjoyable reading. Hope to read all of the mystery series .
2978	A lot of passion: great romance and even more with rereading several times ahero to be loved and aheroine to be dreamed of thank you STEPHANE LAURENS
2979	Blah, blah: The Dalai Lama spouts some clichés about his outlook on life with no new insights. I had to read it for a class. The only good parts I found were "copied" from Norman Vincent Peale's THE POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING written decades before and with a Christian perspective.
2980	Mesmerism...: Can a tune literally represent a stonewall with vines on it or with nothingon it, though it (the tune) be made by a genius whose power of objectivecontemplation is in the highest state of development? Can it be done byanything short of an act of mesmerism on the part of Tia Knightor an act of kindness on the part of the listener?written by composer Charles Ives.
2981	This cheese is great: You also buy this cheese a whole foods markets. I'm not a real cheese person, but this cheese is fantastic, very soft and very light. It has a guota taste, so it is not overpowering, which I like.
2982	Great quality, works as designed: I have this gate at the top of the stairs in my house to keep the dogs out of our bedroom area. The gate fits snugly in the doorway and is easy to open and close. Our little puppy is able to squeeze through one part; to prevent this I wrapped some packing tape across the bars. The tape is nearly invisible and prevents the puppy from squeezing through.
2983	Good story: Overall, this is a really good book. At times the story-line is disturbing but it is documenting historical occurrences (though it is a work of fiction.) Diane Noble is very good at developing the characters into persons with whom the reader can relate. I, and several friends, have enjoyed the book and do recommend it.
2984	Mind blowing: Hard to put this book down. It was well written and never grossed me out, even with the content of the book. I highly recommend this read!
2985	Not up to par: I am a Vietnam infantry veteran and served with the 101st Airborne Div during this same time period. Chambers first book, Recondo, was much more interesting and far more accurate. This effort seems to have come from an author who never felt the heat of combat, just heard the stories, I know however, that is not true in this case. His recollections bounce around so much I kept getting lost in the stories. While I was "only a leg" my company employed most all of the super sneeky tactics you macho LRRPs seem to have invented. I bought this book based on the author, my mistake.
2986	I expected better....: I'm sorry to say, but I expected better. I think this film was made poorly. I mean,it is so predictable. This movie is about Jimmy Neutron, a boy genius who invents things. One day, aliens come and take away the whole neighberhood'parents. The children first are happy, but then realize they have been taken by aliens. See this movie to find out what happens.
2987	I was dissapointed: Where are the power chords, the heavy guitar sound ?The tunes did not generate any excitement for me like the Who's tunes of the seventies and early 80's. Roger's vocals are still alright to me, though.
2988	WONDERFUL BOOK!!!IT EARNS ALLLL OF THEM STARS!!: I STRONGLY agree with that 'reader from Washington' who commented on Jack Nicholson playing Crowly! Even though I'm only halfway through the book, I fell in love with the characters, (Aziraphale & Crowly;am I the only one to mention the angel?:) they're incredibly funny. As I was reading the book I could actually see it as a film, it would make a great movie. But, as most books like this go unnoticed by the big shots in Hollywood, it will probably;A: never be a movie.orB: Script Writers will SLAUGHTER it.It's really sad, 'B' describes what befell "The Lost World," which I still get mad about. One thing, I wish they would have left the original cover on the paperback, it was SOOO cool! I kinda thought it showed the character's attitudes better...- KarliBear & Baby Godzilla
2989	Real Music for the True Music Fan: While I don't believe "Good News" isn't their best stuff, it's still a wonderful collection of brilliant melodic songs. Upon going mainstream with a major label, they somehow managed to bring in that crowd and still not alienate the MM die-hards like myself. I've been a faithful listener for about 6 years, and I never tire of any of their stuff...and I have all of it! Warning: upon hearing MM, you will either instantly become a lifelong fan or not like them at all. Brock is a lyrical genius, and it's good to see that he and the band are finally being recognized after 12 years of under-the-radar phenominal stuff. I highly recommend "Lonesome Crowded West" and "This is a Long Drive..." as follow ups to "Good News". They'll give you an idea of MM before they had to trim the fat and get rid of those 8-minute rantings for a mainstream studio album. Also, you MUST see them live. They're a great small venue band.
2990	We love Oswald!: Oswald is colorful, imaginative, and delightful. My daughters have loved watching Oswald and his friends since they were toddlers. We only wish that there were more episodes!
2991	You Really Get Tired of The Same Things Over & Over Again: This album before the release of the single "Girls and Boys" was on my list of cds to buy. After then i noticed wow, all of these songs sound exactly the same. The cd was immediately taken off my list. I would never recommend this album to anyone who doesn't want their time completely wasted. On the other hand, if you would like to listen to sellouts who can't even think of lyrics that go together at all, or even play more than just three different chords to play on their cheap Wal-Mart guitar. These losers are getting to much recognition for the horrible stuff they put out. There are way to many bands like this out there and they need to be stopped. If you want to be a rockstar, take a guitar class.
2992	Grrrrrreat!: So good that I just ordered another one for my pet. Product is well made and also looks cute on
2993	Awesome book!: This was my sons favorite book as a young boy. He had the whole book memorized at 4yrs old! He loved the idea of being able to pick which ending he wanted to hear/read. Now when we need a gift for a young child he always suggests that we buy them this book.
2994	Pretentious, Shallow & Boring.: If one was trying to fight the old ennui one would not attempt to read The Blue Flower. Why do Fitzgerald's characters behave so? No attempt to explain their actions or emotions is made. What made Sophie so attractive? She seems to be devoid of personality & lacking in either charm or beauty. Frederica seems the most interesting character. She did, after all, have the intelligence not to be able to understand the parable of the blue flower.
2995	These pills are hard to swallow: I have to pitch this bottle of pills as each pill is huge and hard to swallow. I tried to bite in half and take it that way. That turned out to be very dangerous as the rough edges of the pill hurt my throat.
2996	Get Swrewed and Chopped: This is a good cd. It Is Lil Flip's U Gotta Feel Me, Chopped and Screwed. If you don't know what Chopped and Screwed is you need to learn some stuff about the Dirty South. I really enjoyed this cd. They should release some of Lil Flip and Three 6 Mafia older cd's Chopped and Screwed. R.I.P SCREW
2997	great workout; intensely irritating camera work: What O'Brien does is fine--a good workout, but the camera people couldn't leave well enough alone. Ordinary color switches to black and white, then to pseudo-colorized, and on many of these, they use a filter meant to suggest an old dusty film--bits of hair, blebs, flaws. The plain color photography is fine, but all the pseudo-artistic fiddles are intensely irritating. They make me very reluctant to use this DVD.
2998	A great start to the series: I liked this book. I was instantly interested in these people's lives. How will Joe react to Kelly's declaration of love? Like any woman, I am also a sucker for a man in uniform, and Joe doesn't disappoint. I also identified with Kelly's religious struggles. I, too, have found myself merely going through the motions without examining why I am doing these things. I highly recommend this book.
2999	VERY GOOD BOOK: It was a very good series and I wish there was more books. Is there any more books after this one?
3000	Checkbook Calculator not worth effort!: This is 2nd, diff item purchased in this category. Not too happy w/operation as it doesn't want to hold info - needs to be reset even more than other one I bought!
3001	about this: This CD seems awfully more referential to 80s hair metal, than Pearl Jam. This guys seem to pretend they are in pain too much (as many DO), but don't make anything more of it. So what is it there to think but that they are asking to be consolated, with millions and crowds, for having something that absolutely everyone has, PAIN. The result is dull, unchallenging.
3002	a polite rant: ‘Straight Forward Riding’ by Lesley Ann Taylor and Carol Brett, is the biggest [dissapointment] in a book I have ever purchased in my life. Literally. The book is nothing more than a slick and shiny and repetitious rant against methods of horsemanship that the authors disagree with, and all of the useful information included in the book could just about fit on one page...
3003	Get Ready to Ship Out...: Nothing can completely prepare you for the experience of basic training... but this book does contain some useful material. If you're completely clueless, this book can point you in the right direction. The most important part of being prepared for basic training is being in the best physical shape of your life before you join, of course, even if you're not, you will be able to pass the PT test by the end of basic. I can't remember exactly where the writer went to Basic Training, but every TRADOC post is a bit different, I went to Fort Knox, and it was the most hardcore experience of my life... it was crazy, and nothing can prepare you for the experience. At least this book might give you a little bit of confidence before you ship out.
3004	Perfect to use it like toilet paper: Hi, I am from Spain, and i Know more or less how everything work there, my boyfriend bought this book, and it was a completly crap, first the names of some areas are wrong, it is completly not updated, it says things like you can go to france and get another turist visa, Hello!!! we are now part of the European Union, so you don't need your passport to go to anyplace in Europe, and so you won't get a new turist visa, try to find any other book better that this and don't waste your money in this crapy book
3005	Scholary Yet Readable! Buy With Confidence.: Raven Grimassi would be the first to say that Wicca has no established sacred writings. Yet she makes a bold contribution to the field with this fascinating view of the history of the Craft from pre-history through the modern era. Nonjudgmental (or not much), and thoroughly researched, this book is a history of the "olde religion," its myths and archetypes, its myriad beliefs and practices, written with style and verve. This book is a history, a reference, and guide to the path of the Wiccan. Although the illustrations are a bit crude, they do not detract from Grimassi's witty prose and knowledgeable style. A must have for every student of the Craft and its history.
3006	Got a hole in them Literally on the first day of wear: Wow, a hole where the big toe is within hours of wearing them? Not worth it. A real shame because they were keeping feet warm until they proved to be of such poor quality.
3007	Kind of Silly: I was looking for a light quick read, and I picked this up, thinking it was a "chick lit" book with a little mystery thrown in. I have to admit I was attracted to the description of the book that said the character was a shopaholic that still shopped in the face of danger. Light, right?The book ended up being pretty silly, not very suspenseful, a liitle too light. It may be good for a vacation read where you find you will not be able to concentrate at all, and just need something to fill time on a beach or by the pool. Something with alot of fluff and not much substance. Too much like the bodice rippers I read in my late teens and early twenties with a modern twist. Not my cup of tea anymore.
3008	This movie could have put me in the cemetery!: I watched this movie a couple days ago, and oh my god, what a snooze fest. I swear to god it was like eight hours long. It is the most boring, mind numbing peice of work that I have ever seen in my life. The plot dragged on forever, and there were so many points in the movie that you thought was the end....but then it kept on going. Even being drunk doesn't make this movie any better. I for one don't understand the good reviews, I think this movie is terrible. Rupert was better in My Best Friends Wedding, than in this pile. Oh, and the make-up and costumes, sucked!
3009	Only a Poet?: I was very surprised that I got through this book. It is not every day that a person will pick up a collection of essays on Classical, Elizabethan and other types of literature, for enjoyments sake. Eliot really outdid himself with his reviews of the literature that he was surrounded by. The definite reads, if you do not want to go through all the essays, are the essays "Dante", "Hamlet and his Problems" and "A Dialogue on Dramatic Poetry". "Dante" is a beuatiful study on both the "Divina Comedia" and "Vita Nouva". "Hamlet" is a putdown on the play that everyone "loves" so much--with the exception of the writer of this sentence. "Dialogue" is a well crafted arguement of the essence of the poetic plays and how they fit into modern--it was written in 1922--times. This book is pure genius, although at points rather "holier-than-thou." Eliot was a genius and he makes sure to let you know it in his essays.
3010	no interactive contents: I can't find any interactive table of contents. With a Kindle, I look for "Kindle" editions, which one of the main requirements for would be an interactive table of contents. Otherwise, I just have to page through the whole document to go somewhere well into it.
3011	The Adventures of Captain Marvel- shazam it: SHAZAM! What Republic could have done with Superman is proven in "The Adventures of Captain Marvel"! What grace and super style does To Tyler have in the role. You can see why Superman and DC feared the "big red chesse".I liked the actress Maria Sponza as the tempress. (God I need a life! She is hot!)
3012	Putco 580433 Element tinted Window Visors: Not real happy. It said on the description that they would fit my vehicle (Honda CRV). They didn't. Have them for sale now...no takers.
3013	Piece of junk: It took me a good long time to check through all the reviews of minute timers, to find one above 2 stars. This one had a few success stories, so I went with it. Not the cheapest, not the most expensive either. It does not work for short timings. It stops ticking. Yes, I turned it past 45 minutes, then back down to 5. They don't make them like they used to.
3014	Makes for quicker and more accurate tuning: This little device takes all the frustration out of tuning your drones. Just simply clamp it on and hold the top holes with the left hand, and the chanter plays Low A, the note that the drones tune to. This allows you to have the Low A constantly sounding to check your drones against, and allows you to listen for the wavering, or "beating," while adjusting your drones. The end result is a more accurately tuned bagpipe. I recommend this to all pipers, from beginners to professionals.
3015	Not worth it.: I wanted to give earphones a chance because I look totally old school with my behind-the-neck headphones. These worked fine for about a week, then the volume adjuster on the wire gave up and distorted the sound. They isolate you from everything going on around you, which can be dangerous. They're hard to put in and not very comfortable. What a piece of crap, given how much it costs. Don't buy these.
3016	Great read: If you love Christian fiction this is a book for you. A great uplifting story. I highly recommend this book.
3017	Bought this great CD months ago...time for a REVIEW!!! ^^: Well, to tell you folks the truth. I really wasn't excited about hearing about this band too much, because all the people who were into the CD were little emo pansies. But one day I said "what the hell" and bought the CD. I don't regret it at all. Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses was awesome. Favorite song off the CD is "At Least I Know I'm Sinner." All the songs are VERY good, drummer does a fantastic job of keeping beat and singing at the same time, it's an awesome ability. Out of their 2 major releases, this one is the better of the 2.
3018	Best cd EVER!: This is my favorite cd in the world!!! "Let Met Live" is my #1 favorites song of all time. "View From a Stairway" and "Jareth's Church" tie for the #2 spot. If you have any love for good music, do yourself a favor and buy this cd!
3019	What a rip off!: I buy this calender every year as a Christmas present for my wife who is a gardening fanatic. Imagine the disappointment on Christmas morning when the product did not live up to our expectations. No pictures, cheap paper and not worth even half the price. If we could we'd return it, as it is it probably won't even make good compost! Does anyone know why they "fixed" something that wasn't broken?
3020	Excellent ending: Pretty much the same review I gave for the first DVD, with the exception that it ended pretty well. Lots of action. Really BIG battles over vast spaces.
3021	Great for improving child's memory skills: As the parent of a child with special needs and memory issues, this game has improved my child's memory capability, as well as improved her self esteem. She loves playing the game too which is helpful since she easily gets discouraged in school when the teachers use similar learning tools.
3022	Enriching movie: This is a beneficial movie about what might face a Middle Easterner who chooses to follow Christ in his or her home country. But be ready for hip '80s hairdos and some slightly artificial acting from the "Westerners". Once you get into the main plot, the acting and scenes are well done. You can tell it's low budget, but hey, they did a good job with what they had. Where's the challenge in making a movie when you have $300 million? All in all a good flick that points the honor to Christ where it belongs.
3023	a true story well told: The book starts off a bit slow because some foundation must be set before the treason becomes apparent.I recommend reading through chapter 3 before putting it down. You will surely finish the book then and may even re-read it.An interesting story of how a spy who was being sabotaged escaped, with the help of a couple of miracles. I enjoyed it a lot.Roy
3024	you'll laugh you'll cry you'll love it: how old is this movie? it is very good. i can barely watch it without shedding a tear. i always laugh. an great movie and an classic.
3025	One of the better superhero cartoons.: This is one of the better Superhero cartoons available on DVD. I think it has one of the best theme songs of all time. The animations is top notch and the storytelling is good too. The addition of the new guys, Firestorm and Cyborg was handled pretty good.
3026	Unfortunately, one boring & terrible book: I love Anne Rice novels; unfortunately, this book was so boring - it took me weeks to finish it. I usually cannot put her books down and will stay up over a night to finish them. This book was strictly "put me to sleep" material. The story was so disjointed, I had trouble following what was going on. I hope the next book goes back to the great Rice style I know.
3027	Speakers won't work after 5 months: A few weeks after I bought it the open button would get stuck so the door wouldn't stay down. It's a reoccurring problem, but so far I've been able to unstick it enough for the door to close... but it's not easy.The speakers just died on it after it was only 5 months old. I do not play it loud, I don't abuse it, & I don't even use it often. AMF, I take good care of my gadgets. The sound from the earphone jack also died at the same time. So it means the audio amp chip inside is blown. Fortunately, I had a high-impedance set of earbuds with a volume control built in the line lying around. I was able to plug it in the audio out in the back of the player to get sound from there.Unfortunately the battery pack covers those output jacks when one is going portable. So the only way I could get sound now, is without the battery.
3028	I've not finished watching the whole season yet, and this is fantastic.: There is a four episode story arc involving the clones and a replacement general which is fantastic! I think LucasFilms crew went all out on these episodes; they're fearfully engrossing. I can't wait to finish off the rest of the season.
3029	noodle & doodle: I was excited to find this selection on Amazon and I ordered it right away. I think Les Paul is a national treasure and Chet Atkins is no slouch either. The music was a great disappointment. It sounds like they just sat down for the first time with no preparation and that each played gingerly for fear of outdoing the other guy. They succeeded so well that, in my opinion, the result is thoroughly weak. I also have very little use for the "Boys Club" style comments before during and after some of the numbers. This selection should be marketed as the informal practice session that it is. Normally, I complain about cd's offering significantly less than an hour of music. Here it's a relief.
3030	Bad book: I did not like it. It is a bad story. Wolfs are not bad like in the story. Peter doesnt listen to his grandpa, so it is a bad example.
3031	Betty is a real Diamond !: I bought this DVD on amazon France. It was my first DVD with Betty Page and like many other men, I'm under her spell now. What a pleasure to discover these little gems ! Of course she's not the greatest dancer in the world, but what marvelous curves she has and what a lovely smile. The duo with Tempest Storm is one of the highlights of this DVD. The quality of these films is quite good for the 35mm features. For the 8mm and 16mm features, the quality is not so great, but they are worthwatching because very rare. I adore Betty's clown dance (wish I would be a clown !), Betty's hat dance and look for the last one called Pin-up beauties fight . It's amazing ! Betty Page is like a diamond ! And everybody knows Diamonds are forever !
3032	Very Disapointed: I orderd this DVD because it said it had subtitles, when I received it and began to watch it I quickly learned other wise. The DVD did not have subtitles. The case for the DVD said there were subtitles but there were no such thing, or any sort of opption allowing you to add them. I was really looking forward to watching this documentary and was very disponited in my purchase.
3033	I AGREE WITH EVERYONE ELSE!: HEY DVD PUBLISHERS!!!! ARE YOU LISTENING TO YOUR BUYERS!!!!!I bought the SOAP COMPLETE series (another great 70s show that I highly recommend) from Amazon for way less than these bums are asking for Love boat series. Until the price of the Love boat series becomes reasonable I wouldn't touch it.
3034	Good for its day: I feel that this book gets such high ratings due to the fact that it was written in the 60's. Of course this was an important and exciting work back then, but today I think it is rather dull. The author does a great job of developing characters, and telling a story. However, where is the plot and the excitement? Another reviewer mentioned that you need to read this book at least twice to really grasp what is going on. I agree with this and also the fact that it wasn't entertaining enough to justify reading it again. I believe what people want to see today is for the author to go one step further with the alternate timeline(s), and show some action or consequences. This book left you hanging, and wanting a little too much. But that's just my opinion...
3035	Works Nicely with XBOX: Works well with my XBOX and D-Link router which is approximately 50 feet and 2 walls away. Did not notice any lag during game play. One problem I had was configuring it via a laptop, I spent over an hour trying to make the bridge connect to the router with no success. When I tried the same by connecting the bridge to my desktop everything configured perfectly right away.
3036	Disappointing Piece of Junk: I took a chance on this mask for my son. The mask has a powerful polymer smell that makes it unpleasant to use, the plastic clips barely grip the vinyl ridges used to adjust and hold the straps in place, and the plastic clip broke off and was lost during the first use, rendering the mask unusable. Do not waste your money on this mask.
3037	I still remember how I hated this book after all these years: My son got this book through Scholastic book order when he was in 3rd or 4th grade (he's a college sophomore now).I read most of my son's books back then, and enjoyed them all, except this one. As a matter of fact, I hated this book, I hate it after all these years. This study does not give you hope, but despair.I threw it to the recycle bin after I read it. I wish I could give it a negative rating.
3038	Good entertainment but no surprises: Martins The Hedgeknight offers good entertainment but no real surprises. The artwork is great, though, and as a Martin-fan, I look forward when no. 2 is comming this fall.
3039	Not worth it.: Out of all my dance dvd workouts this one disappointed me. As a HUGE fan of Dirty Dancing I was hoping this dvd would teach me the dances from the moive. Nothing in this workout was from the movie other than the music. If I wanted that then I could have put in any dance workout dvd and just play the music in the background. Not worth it!
3040	Buy this cd!: The Lost City Angels are one of my new favorite bands. I saw them with Tiger Army and I loved them so much I went and saw them with Social Distortion a few weeks later. The whole cd rocks, my favorites being "Broken world" and "Today's the Day". Make sure to see them on tour this summer. They put on an amazing show and I can't wait to see them again!
3041	entertaining, but...: this book is entertaining. story moves fast, but has includes flashbacks to the 13th century which i didnt really enjoy. there's a twist or two in the book, which is expected.i would have given this book 3 stars if it wasnt for the ending. seriously, if you've ever watched a "goodguy vs badguy" adventure on television, the ending wont surprise you.
3042	Junk Junk Junk Junk: I bought this from Lee Valley woodworking in Ottawa Ontario and I am shocked they would carry this garbage. DO NOT BUY THIS. Mine will not work, period. Nothing. Just like many other people here too.
3043	Defective Design: I bought one of these and the trimmer feature broke after a few months. It has a button that pops the trimmer up, and then you have to push it back down until it snaps in place. Well the trimmer could no longer snap back into place, so I would have to manually hold the trimmer down while using the foil to shave. VERY awkward. I bought a second one, thinking I just abused the first one, exact same thing happened. This razor isn't worth it.
3044	Great read: This book gave me alot to think about. Although I don't agree with every word that Moore says, I disagree with those who say he is an extreme leftist, dripping with ego, anti-American or anti-Christian. I found very little to suggest that he is any of those things in this book. He backs up his arguements with facts, he is not condescending, and he believes in the principles this country stands upon. He makes sense."Dude, Where's My Country" is both entertaining and thought provoking. I recommend it to anyone interested in politics, regardless of their party affiliation. If you aren't sure about Moore and don't want to spend the money on his book, check for it at your local library or try to borrow it from someone. You might learn something.
3045	Jari's excellent !!!: One of the best fat-burning muscle-stimulating products ever. Jari Love will get you in shape. I have used her other workouts before (they are more strength training oriented), and cannot praise them enough. I am that much stronger and more confident because of them.
3046	Wish they would have made it flexible: I First thing i noticed about this dashboard mount when it arrived is it is not flexible, The base is fixed. All you can do is move the rotating holder of the GPS to the position you want. You cannot bend or move the handle fixed to your dash-board. My Earlier Windshield mount (Which broke) had that. The Product looks strong. I Started using the permanent join rather than the temporary one (As i didn't wanted the GPS unit to keep failing, Which happened so many times with the windshield mount until it broke). Over all i am giving 2 stars for the price i am paying for this and the design of this product.
3047	It is what it is: If you're a long time Oakenfold fan, then don't read this review. I admit that this album is not a highlight of Oakenfold's mixing career, but we the songs on this album are not half bad. If you're new to Oakenfold's work, than this is definitely a place to start. This cd advertises with the title that it is CLUB music (meaning that these are songs that you can definitely bump and grind to at a club) which is exactly what this album has succeeded in. With remixes of Justin Timberlake's "Rock Your Body" along with vocals by pop artists like Natasha Bedingfield, one look at this album and you can already make inferences that the beats will be poppy. One major gripe I have about this album is that the selection of songs and the order they appear on this album are inconsistent with no careful though or planning.
3048	MILO [isn't good]?: From reading the previous reviewers, I had very low expectations for this movie. But it actually turned out to be pretty good. Milo's voice is creepy, so is the music. It's very eerie in some parts. I oneof those people who don't get scared in a movie. I like getting scared in a movie though. This one surprised me. This would be a good one for those who are new to horror/slasher flicks.
3049	I couldn't put it down.: I read Killing Pablo in a few hours during a sick day from work. It's a thrilling read that's quite pertinent to our times. I suspect that Bowden wrote Killing Pablo with the assumption that someone would make it a film (like Black Hawk Down), which I think damages some of the integrity of his research. Still, it is engrossing.
3050	Failed: Although merchandise arrived quicker than promised, and the color was perfect, the socks didn't even last through one baseball game.........lousy product!!!
3051	It's all downhill from here...: This dvd player was great in the beginning. After about 1 month of use, it's starting to freeze up during movies. Next time I'm going to spend the extra money and get one thats worth keeping. I guess you get what you pay for right?
3052	Any Difference from NewMarket Naturals?: Anyone know if this filter replacement cartridge is the same as the New Market Naturals replacement cartridge? They look the same...cost about the same.Thanks for any replies.UPDATE: I have made a phone call to New Market Naturals and they told me the Sprite filters are exactly the same as their own.I have very hard water which has taken quite a toll on my hair and skin. I ordered the "April Shower APHH Handheld Shower Head and Filter Includes Pulse Massage" in Feb. 2010, I have noticed a notable improvement in the my hair and slight improvement in my skin.This is a very nice and affordable option to helping improve the water quality in a rental unit where water hardness/softness is not a tenant responsibility.Since, at this time I noticed the New Naturals brand replacement filters cost less, I will order them vs the Sprite.
3053	Review of GeoTrax Harbor Docks L ighthouse: My youngest sons face light up every time this lighthouse is triggered by a passing train. Fantastic product. Always pleased with the GeoTrax series.
3054	Heart of Gold: I bought this paperback for a class I was taking. The condition was o.k.Enjoyed reading the book. Thank you.
3055	Junk: I guess you get what you pay for. The ball would not lock in any position, no way no how. A waste of any amount of money.
3056	V.O.D. at their prime: Absolutly astounding! Vision of Disorder's 1999 album 'For the Bleeders' is the straight up best hardcore album out there today. I've been a Vision of Disorder fan for quite some time now, and I have collected all their albums. I have to admit though, every morning I find myself comming back to 'For the Bleeders' because of its intestly hard vocals/drums/ and guitars. This album is Tim Williams in his prime. I recommend this album to anyone who is ready for something harder than metal music. This album is an example of 100% straight up hardcore music. Enjoy!
3057	Not even worth that!: I recently purchased the new 52 inch Samsung B750 (from Amazon) and picked up this HDMI cable as an afterthought. I figured it had over 2000 reviews, almost 5 stars, and was only 70 cents at the time. Plus... all HDMI cables are the same right? Great deal! Wrong. I plugged it in only to see my new TV reading, "Check signal cable." Frustrated, I went to pull out the cable and troubleshoot, but the metal casing stayed in the port, permanently disabling the cable! Trash.Upon further research, I've discovered there is in fact a difference between HDMI cables (category 1 vs 2, etc) and that some of my friends have had similar experiences with this particular model. Sure, it costs almost nothing, but you're better off buying a soda from the vending machine. With this cable, you definitely get even less than what you pay for. Buyer beware.Justin
3058	It works for most games.: I bought this item after hearing about it on amazon and thought it would be great. I read that it doesnt fully work with Resident Evil. I also found out for my self that it doesnt work at all with Eternal Darkness. This product did work for me with Sonic Adventure 2 and Super Mario Sunshine. So if it is worth the risk of not working all games and you have extra ps2 controllers lying around I will recomend this item. It's only [money]
3059	awesome product: immediatly after my cleric leveled and was able to get a new feat i picked one from this book and will be picking my next three feats from this source book.nuff said
3060	There should be a negative for this item: it works well enough for as long as it works. Two weeks seems to be the limit though. After the first two weeks it corrupted a perfectly good IPOD twice that I managed to recover, I got a new one and it worked for another two weeks now the speakers quit, dont bother
3061	With No One As Witness: Elizabeth George is a prolific writer. Her series featuring Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his partner, Barbara Havers has been made into a television series. It was for this reason that I read her latest in the Lynley-Havers series. It is certainly the best so far. This is a long book, but it never gets bogged down. Lynley and Havers, along with newly promoted Detective Sargeant Winston Nkata, investigate a serial killer who kills and mutilates adolescent boys. Nkata deals with a reluctant love interest, Havers with a deepening friendship with her neighbor, and Lynley with a family tragedy while pursuing this high profile murder case. George has woven this all together into a moving, beautifully written story.
3062	by the Numbers&Lame: "I Love this Bar" is a trip&that is all I can tolerate from this Album.Vocally Toby Keith is decent but the Music&overall direction here is not working.it seems like He is trying to live up to a certain Image of being Precieved as the OutLaw RedNeck or something&the Novelty wears pretty thing really fast.the songs feel more like Skits than anything else overall.He has always been one of those type of artists that is alright in spots but not alot of substance for a whole set but this Album even questions that logic.
3063	Innovative storage: I liked the fact that these could be stacked and were adjustable to keep the CD's vertical. They also didn't look cheap although they were inexpensive.
3064	Nice sharpener: This ceramic sharpener is the first one I have owned. You can really tell that it sharpens a blade although my own skills in finding the right angle is very great.
3065	Misleading as to size: I will be traveling to Brazil with my diabetic 16 pound cat. I read the reviews over and over because I was afraid my cat wouldn't fit in it. The 18 inches long includes the wheels. The real lengh is 16. There is no way my 16 pound cat would fit comfortably in there. Only if she were smashed during the 15 hours trip. Since it's said here that it will carry a 22 pounds animal, I decided to buy it. I guess my husband will use it as a backpack now... and we'll have to buy another carrier for the trip.
3066	HYSTERICAL!!!: This is great for a laugh. Never have I read a book or "documentary" so misinformative. Usually authors like to research a subject thoroughly before writing a book on it. But not this guy. He figured he would just go at it and improvise. Well, it shows! It's the Geraldo of literature. Carl makes references to bands like Sultic Frost (???...Get the name right, it'll give you more credibility!) and other metal bands in a feeble attempt to prove his point; Satanism is bigger than disco. Stay away from this one if you are looking for anything factual. However, if you like books with countless references to "Chinese Communists," then this is your pick!
3067	And I don't even like them: I've never really liked Radiohead, the singer's voice kind of annoys me, but this album blew me away. I still think they're pretentious but here they actually pull it off without it being embaressing, which is pretty rare in music. There are so many different forms of music going on in this album it can take a while to digest, my suggestion is finding a favorite and listening to the rest of the album every time you want to hear that. That's what got me to love it. Backdrifts is just cool.
3068	Gack!: I have tried to watch this movie more times than I can count and every time I fall asleep. It would have kept my attention better if an angry bear broke in the house and mauled a few of them.
3069	IT IS JUST A CHEAP COPY OF TERMINATOR 2!!!: not good, it's just a cheap copy of the awesomeTERMINATOR 2, judgement day.the car-chases, the speach... and the scenes are all likeTHE "TERMINATOR 2'S"INSTAID I RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THE SPECIAL EDITION OF TERMINATOR 2, It is worth the price i tell you, do not buy this movie it is waste of money.
3070	Misses the Point: The problem with this book is that the authors take data about millionaires' spending habits and mold it into a recipe for acquiring wealth. Of course, frugality is key. But whether or not you choose Timex over Rolex, or Buick over BMW is much less important than investing money wisely. And this book does not cover investment concepts like portfolio management and diversification. Furthermore, the reason many of the so-called wealthy are frugal, middle-of-the-road spenders is that their incomes are modest, five-figure salaries, and their net worth conists largely of stocks and other holdings. In other words, these individuals often don't have enough disposable income to be considered truly wealthy and spend voraciously. If the authors at least discussed the "greatest invention of the 20th century" (acc. to Einstein-compound interest-the book might be useful for those looking to start building a retirement nest.
3071	EBOOKMAN: I bought an EBOOKMAN at local store for [money] with a [money] mail in rebate. This is a fantastic PDA in that you can download from the Net free books, games, music. You can download your address book, date book from Outlook. I am VERY HAPPY with this purchase and the fact that I GOT IT FOR [money] AT local store!
3072	How to download lap times: Great watch, but I didn't receive an instruction manual from TIMEX, and although I can record Lap times, I can't read them later. Today I walked 21 laps and resorted to writing down the times in a small notebook each time I pressed the lap button. That worked, but seemed pretty primitive. Is there a manual somewhere? Thanks, Dixon
3073	Good Book: This is my second review on Amazon. I seriously have a lot of catching up to do.I love books about animals as I am such an animal lover myself. The read was cool, which hotted up at the end, although a little slow moving to begin with. In the second half I couldn't put it down, I had to know the ending as I was on tender hooks all through the time. I guess part of this story was very emotional. Well worth a read despite the slow beginning.
3074	Lexmark just play tricks: A printer doesn't use standard printer cable, and doesn't come with the who-knows-what non-standard USB cable. Just go get any other printer.
3075	Excellent translation and commentary of this scripture: I've read many translations of the Bhagavad-Gita; they range from mediocre to horrendous. Eknath Easwaran, however, has made this scripture not only accessible, but warm and inviting. The language is lucid, though always challenging. Even more helpful is Easwaran's extensive commentary on each verse of the Gita. He modernizes this scripture, and shows how very pertinent it is in today's turbulent world. Sri Easwaran is quite likeable--very funny, gentle, and unpretentious. The Bhagavad-Gita, simply put, is a book of two choices, and their consequences. It does not have a lot of do's and dont's, nor does it lead the reader to feel inferior or degraded. This book, in short, has tremendously shaped my life, and I believe it has the power to also do so for anyone who is lonely, confused, or simply wants some kind of guidance to lead them through life. Buy all three books; it will, I promise, be one of the best investments you'll ever make.
3076	This wasn't meant to be taken seriously, people!: This was a great movie on a day when you're hungry for a little comic adventure deep in the bowels of San Francisco Chinatown. It was a funny comic adventure when you need to escape from reality, that's all it has ever been and that's all it ever will be. I hate it when critics talk about a movie such as this like they walked in expecting Casablanca or something. I often wondered after this why Dennis Dun, who plays Wang Chi, a friend of Kurt Russell's character whose finacee is kidnapped by a sorceror who needs to marry her to be able to rule the Universe from beyond the grave, didn't do more in Hollywood, or even more with just John Carpenter. He played a good counterpart to Kurt Russell's Jack Burton, a guy who seemed like he'd seen one John Wayne movie too many, while his friend Wang was the calmer voice of reason. I haven't seen the DVD yet but I plan to and I'm sure it rules!
3077	Must have for Social Workers!: This is a great book to help any kid after a traumatic event has happened in their life, whether witnessing violence or being part of it. The best part of this book is that the "terrible thing" is never described, so it can be used to talk about divorce, death and anything in between. The end talks about how good it feels to talk about the terrible thing, which is put nicely in children's language. Great book.
3078	THIS is the book: I purchased this book along with two others as we embark on our journey to move to the country. The other two books were very good at helping to identify location and prospective properties. "Finding and Buying" is the reference to winnowing propsective properties. Les Scher goes into great and well written detail on what to look for and look out for relative to the common issues of water, surveying, easements and access. Additionally, Les describes Eminent Domain, Condemnation and Adverse Posession; things to consider in a rural purchase. The model contract alone is worth the price of the book!Les - If you ever read this, THANK YOU!
3079	Buy one from Vtech direct: I ordered this from Amazon January 9th and it was listed as in stock, As of today it is now out of stock and the next shipping date is the end of February. I went to the Vtech website, ordered it for the same price and paid $5.00 shipping and have it now - before our child is walking on her own!!It is lots of fun, well balanced so it does not tip, and entertaining. We are likely to lose the little phone that is not attached but we will try to keep it in place. It is a steady walker for her to push and it turns with ease. It has a lot of activities and music that she enjoys (and runs on just 2 AA batteries). If you want a quiet toy, this may not be it (although you can turn it off). But it is the best walker we found and the price is great. Just get it straight from Vtech!!
3080	OK Writing, Ironic Subject Here: Its odd how this book supposes to be about Morrie's gradual decline and final-year's wisdom but it turns out to be about the authors seemingly bottomless fears about death. The author verges on panic attack as Morrie gracefully flows away; somehow the author seems impervious to Morrie's 'teaching' though many of us readers probably 'get it'. No doubt the author learned a lot about himself too, but in the end he seems to retain his immense dread of death. Its these terribly fearful and panicked friends & relatives who ALWAYS ruin the experience of departing for the rest of us !
3081	Not Working: When I received the weather station I could tell right away that the barometer was not working, as mentioned in some of the other reviews. It did not move the couple of days I had it before I returned it and was stuck in a very low reading. The other gauges worked fine. Disappointed that they ship these items that do not work. Do not buy this brand.
3082	Garden Birds: Item arrived in a timely manner, and in excellent condition. Book has wonderful pictures, and written instructions. Great for decorating small items, and how to paint feathers.
3083	The Worst Book on the Planet: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!This by far the worst book I have come accross in my life.I am a mechanical engineer taking statistics for my MBA. Fortunately I have a very good intstructor so I dont even use the book.Its worthless. Seems like the author is talking to himself.
3084	Body Movin' with Wise Words: Though there is no "Bra Song," he is declaring the racy "Dance For Me" as a "Thong Song" sequel! This time around Sisqo's got it all -- techno,dance,and slow jams. And his lyrics are deep -- he may seem tough, but he follows his heart. The best song on the new album is "Dreams." It is a powerful ballad that will make girls melt in their boyfriends arms.
3085	An Abortion of Sound: This music is seriously the worst thing I have ever heard. Richie Havens is just too talented to produce this kind of trash. Two thumbs down, way down.
3086	psycho-babble: psycho-babble, this was horrible. I've been listening to audio style cds to and from work for 3 years now this is the first one I actully turned off it was so bad.
3087	Not really very good: I honor the "greatest generation" and what they gave us through their sacrifice. But this movie is maudlin tripe. Notice I am not attacking those who fight for the rest of us. I am attacking this crummy movie.
3088	Wings work better when they stay on: The wings come with a warning that they could be a choking hazard. *Fortunately* this risk is 99.9% removed by the straps that simply do not stay velcroed. Our son is only three (and a skinny three I may add) and already we have had to put the straps on the largest setting. If we can manage to get them on him without the velcro undoing, the first time he tries to fly "to infinity and beyond" at least one strap snaps. I am going to try to sew them shut, because he LOVES LOVES LOVEs having Buzz Lightyear wings, but I certainly wouldn't buy them again.
3089	$200 paper weight: Worked quietly for a while (over a year), then the flimsy, spring-like metal overflow switch got bent which is quite easy to do removing the bucket. We're out of warranty and Soleus Air won't touch it or sell a replacement part. The worst -- they won't even recommend anybody locally who could repair it. With support like that, I wouldn't recommend Soleus Air to anyone.
3090	Ethics & Character Are Key: Only in recent times have we started to see films that showed how hard it was for a truly righteous warrior to exist in crooked bureaucracies. It's as if the Japanese are finally willing to admit that their history was not perfect or glamorous. This film shows how hard it was for a family man to keep his family strong in the midst of poverty and turmoil, even as a professional warrior. This is a must for modern martial artists and MA teachers to see.
3091	This dame is all wet!: A fairly good period mystery is spoiled by attempting to use the venicular of the 40s. The technique is over used, distracting, and if the purpose was to make the heroine more distinctive, while it may have, it certainly did not enhance the story. I won't buy anymore of this series.
3092	A Clarinetist's Omnibook: Well and thoughtfully written, "Clarinet Secrets" is helpful for players at all levels, particularly at the advanced intermediate level. It will serve as a handbook for professionals as well. The variety of styles, including Klezmer, is remarkable.
3093	Choosing a Cruising Sailboat???: My review is simply that this book was mis-titled. It should have read Designing a Cruising Sailboat not Choosing. It speaks less of real boats and more about 4-5 mythical boats of which the author walks you through the design process of. If you've got lots of cash and want to see your custom design come to life this book may be for you. The author even goes so far as to say that proper boat maintenance starts when you visit your boat builder while your boat is being built and blah blah...at this point I considered the book a loss.
3094	Good Dog: Dirt Dog does it all. Garage, kitchen, hallway, living room with short plush carpet. I am impressed.
3095	Breathtaking Beautiful Boot: I normally don't purchase boots or shoes over the internet because my foot is hard to fit. I also don't wear heals. I am very pleased with this purchase however. I wish I had bought a three more pairs for my daughters. If I could still get this price and their size, I would order them today. The boots have a gel bottom inside that is so comfortable, you don't feel like you are wearing a boot. The heal is not painfully noticeable. They are so striking to look at, my husband let out a "Wow" when he saw them on. Great craftsmanship, breathtaking beautiful, and an excellent price, what is not to love!
3096	Great Movie: As a girl that grew up in mid-missouri and has parents living in southern missouri... This movie is very real depiction... As I watched the movie I could so say wow I know someone just like that character.. They did a wonderful job with the setting and it was amazing the real feel of this movie... It really showed the darker side of rural country missouri... Great movie!!!!!!!!!!
3097	Mold on suction holder: I like the design of the brush, but the suction part that sticks to the counter or wherever developed some sort of mold. I tried to bleach it and it did nothing to improve the condition of the plastic. If you aren't expecting to use this brush for longer than a month or two, it's fine, otherwise it's a little creepy. I've had mine about a year, but it got the mold after a few months. It stayed on the counter top where there was water but water only. The nipple brush does rust as well. It's too bad because the brush works well.
3098	Not bad: Wasn't very interesting in the begining. Didn't keep me interested for very long. Didn't finish the book bc I got bored.
3099	Poor design: I need a brush for my cast iron cookware. The head of this brush pops off with minimal pressure due to an incomplete ring. The wire retainer only goes about 1/2 way around the head, which does not allow any reasonable pressure to be used for cleaning. It happened with my first use and all subsequent tries. I have since purchased alternates with more attention to their design. Be warned.
3100	I love the idea: I love the idea, but it falls short. My kids were bored by the whole book. Sadly. I really was hoping that it could be done. But if you want to tie your beliefs into the kids education the teach it separate from math. this book does not work. From a homeschooling Mom of eight.
3101	Certainly worth buying: What differs this movie from the others is that Mr.Ripley is an anti-hero, though you want him to win. I think this movie will be something different for those, who are tired of watching Mr.nice guys all the time. I have read the book years ago and and I think it is a very good adaptation but could have also been better. That's why I rated it with 4 stars whereas i'd rate the book with 5. The acting by Matt Damon is also very impressive, he is just like the Ripley I had in mind as i was reading the book. I hope they also shoot the other Ripley books soon.
3102	Compatible Brand Toner Woes: My purchase experience was very good with regard to the seller and delivery. I've bought two of these compatible toner cartridges and find them to be substandard. The first one had a defective drum shutter that caused frequent paper jams. Any curling of the leading edge of the sheet prevented the sheet from going over the drum as it should. Print quality was excellent when it printed. Duplex printing was impossible. The second cartridge prints with a thin solid vertical black line on the right edge of each sheet. The bargain cartridges may be OK for drafts or other non important work, but anyone looking for trouble free printing should buy the genuine HP replacement.
3103	Great stuff: I had bought a jar on a trip to the states a few years ago and when I ran out I was sure I would never find it a again (I love the smell). But, thanks to the Internet (and Amazon) I've found it again and it's a great product.
3104	Annette in baby dolls...watch out Lolita!: As Annette finishes singing "Stuffed Animal" to a hulking, multi-colored toy cat, it actually winks at her. This is the kind of movie AIP did best: low-budget, low-brow fun. There are some talky scenes(between Martian Tommy Kirk and Frankie Avalon--shunted off in a cameo), but who cares when you've got Annette, more beautiful here than ever. She's also got some juicy-fruit lines like: "Both you birds belong in a clock!" A gem.
3105	Excellent material - easy read - practical!: Having been in and out of network marketing over the years - I feel that my life would have been much better had I had this book as my guide in the beginning.I will not sign on a new distributor in my organization until after they have read this book and I've quized them about it's content and lessons. If they desire to go on then I know I got someone worth working with!
3106	Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl Written by Herself: This is an interesting, although not the best written book I've seen. Not sure who I'd recommend this book to.
3107	Excellent but disorienting.: Fans of NBC's Office will be quite disoriented by this original BBC version of the show. Show structures and characters will seem familiar yet startlingly British and quite disorienting. Ricky Gervais is quite talented and his quirky staff are quite good. After getting used to the peculiar British sensibilities of the program and the much dirtier comedy in evidence, fans can appreciate just how clever this program is. This box set is the complete package and showcases every last bit of the show including the startling revelation that the Documentary format which has become comedy gold was basically just Gervais' and Merchant's way to save money while shooting their pilot. Accidental genius. Any serious fan of the American Office should definitely get this even if they do not appreciate it as much as the American version. This British show began the phenomenon and the American Office is the completion of a masterful comic format.
3108	Huh...: Wow, I really don't understand why so many people like this series. It was cliche and predictable; I could see the ending from a mile away! The characters were weak, and held back the plot of the story (Every freakin' character has unlimited magical powers! The lead female character is such a Mary Sue that I actually thought the author was joking. Also, why is every character unbelievabley gorgeous? That was a big pet peeve of mine while reading the series). I had to force myself to finish the books. BAD BAD BAD. If you are a reader of mature adult fantasy, do not subject yourself to these horrible books (no offense). One last thought...just because the story takes place in "hell" and has sex in it does not mean it is an "adult" story. Why did so many reviewers warn of offensive content? I felt like I was reading a children's book! Man, it feels good getting this off my chest.
3109	cure: Cure for the Common Life: Living in Your Sweet Spot by Max Lucado is the perfect solution for someone in need of a push to their right direction. Or more so just at a loss of what to do or where to go in life that will make them happy in doing so. I believe Max to be the forerunner in this area, he can snap anyone out of anything and get them in their right path.This book is for the sole purpose of helping its reader find his or her "sweet spot" in life. He gives great refernce text and an amazing collection of examples. The best part has to be the questionnaire to finding your sweet spot, very helpful. Max has hit the spot with this one.
3110	Don't waste your time or money: This printer was purchased for low volume office use. From day one, the toner has been unevenly distributed across the printed pages. Shaking the toner cartridge as Samsumg suggests works for a page or two but them it's back to the same problem. The printer is useless for printing envelopes. They come out faint as a watermark and barely readable every time. Reading other reviews reveals that there is no fix for this problem. My advice - as with almost everything else, is that you get what you pay for. Don't waste your money on this product.
3111	Terrible: I'm not sure why I hated this movie so much, since I've certainly seen- and enjoyed- movies that were much more disturbing. Maybe it was the fact that I felt like I was watching empty shells instead of actual characters- like, some motivation would've been nice. Although, I did miss about forty-five minutes of the movie, since after tolerating as much of it as I could I had to just fast-forward to the end to see what happened, and I have never before not sat through an entire film, which just goes to show how bad this was. The most redeeming aspect was Cameron Diaz, who showed more talent than her role deserved, and an opening sequence that was truly brilliant. Too bad the rest of the film couldn't maintain it. Don't see this movie.
3112	Excellent: Great product, very usefull...with the rainy weather in Panama where I live it is almost a must have if you have a baby and like to go outdoors
3113	Incredible Book with a Horrible Title.: "How to Solve All Your Money Problems Forever" by Victor Boc, is a wonderful book with a bad title in my opinion. It shows you how to combine affirmations with "glad giving" and experience the incredible results. Using this book, as one of several tools, I have improved my Life considerably. Not only has my income expanded significantly, but I have been able to use these techniques along with journaling, etc... to become more of a whole person. The material objects and money aren't as important anymore, (they don't hurt though.) Now I am experienceing life. Great Book, but the title is off-putting for me as it seems a little less than positive.
3114	A+ for our American Lighting Desk Lamp: Consider this design. The second like it we've ordered over the years. Charming, handy and lovely in its simplicity.Highly recommended. Good transaction. Thanks much!
3115	VERY DISAPPOINTED: We bought the castle for our five year old granddaughter and we were very diappointed. It was very fragile with various parts like the balcony railing popping off with the slightest movement of the castle. I think Disney should not put their name on such a poor toy which was not cheap.
3116	Angry: Reading this book made me angry at the person who first recommended the author. This was the most absurd plot I have ever attempted to follow. The heroes are only slightly less stupid than the villains. How many places can the Reverend Ferguson possibly "happen" to appear? At the crime scene? With the villian's wife? With the murder weapon? Ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous.
3117	Disappointment: I regret buying this book, I felt the author was imature and maybe not yet over her own divorce. I could not decipher whether the author was portraying herself as an attorney, physcologist or divorced mother. Having gone through a divorce myself I had hoped that this book would give me hindsight but came away pondering if the author realizes as I came to realize that it takes two to make a marriage just as it takes both parents to make a civil divorce for the children involved. I wonder if the author has yet to realize from the tone of her book she is quite likely a part of the problem. I found no solutions in this book.
3118	Great Clean Humor: Loved it! This DVD is jam-packed with fresh, creative, hilarious material performed with comic perfection. Our whole family enjoyed it, and I've already watched it three times. Be prepared to laugh until it hurts.
3119	Very Disapointing: Not worth $70 :( Poorly shot, parts missed due to equipment faliure that he mentiones in comentary. If this guy is a "Veteran news cameraman" you think he'd know his equipment, when watching a video we don't want excuess like that, especially when were paying $70!!! I'd only recommend buying this if you find it cheap. Oh and they are DVD-R discs :(
3120	I was so surprised!: I saw Zoolander because someone recommended it to me when I mentioned that I really wanted to see a comedy that didn't have the disgusting elements of Austin Powers (which doesn't even back up disgusting with funny) or Scary Movie (just plain ...). I didn't really think I would like Zoolander, but I took a chance and I loved it!I won't even attempt to describe the movie, as there are a surprising number of little plot complexities and I don't want to ruin the movie for the potential watcher. I'll just say that you have male models, vacuous empty brains, assisins, and tons of great eighties music. The whole thing is funny and ridiculous and doesn't even try to pretend that it's anything else.Some of the best stuff, though, is the extras on the DVD version. The VH1 fashion awards clips are hysterical as are the 'public service announcements' and a lot more. The extras alone are worth watching.
3121	Impracticle: I was disappointed by the author as I had brought the book with quite a lot of expectation. The author recommends us to live our life in such a protected manner that it is actually hilarious. Well it is opposite of my philosophy which says that one should be strong internally to be able to take care of anything that is dealt to us.
3122	Pretty Good CD: This is a pretty good CD, compared to a lot of other CDs on the market now, but you can get tired of the songs easily. I like "One Voice" a lot, I think Brandy should get into more gospel songs. Basically, if you like singers like Monica, you'll like this CD.
3123	The Greatest Wizard Book: I loved reading Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone because of all the drama and suspense. Also, it gives kids a chance to see a story from a wizard's point of view.Harry at first doesn't even know that he's a wizard, a very famous one at that. Hagrid, the keeper of keys at Hogwarts, comes and gets Harry and takes him to Gringotts to get some of his money, get supplies for school like robes and such, and then Harry is off to Hogwarts on the train on Platform Nine and Three Quarters.Even though what happens in the book could never happen in the real world, it's fun to pretend. You get tangled in the pages of the book and never want to put the book down. I recommend this book to kids with BIG imaginations!
3124	Good album of Monk's works: I was a bit bothered by the first reviewer who apparently is a bit beffudled by good jazz. There is nothing difficult or inaccesible about this album. Unfortunately many people are not able to hear this music and use such words as weird, abstract, dissonant, and intellectual to describe their reactions. However, this just means that the person's ear is not able to hear the music. The Kenny Barron version of "Well You Needn't"was particularly good. This is just excellent straight ahead jazz.
3125	not outstanding: Diamond's contributions to the understanding of the forces of geology and food production are important, but he seems to completely miss the point regarding other patterns which shape the direction of history. "Nonzero : The Logic of Human Destiny" by Robert Wright is a much more enjoyable and enlightening read.
3126	I HATE THIS C.D.: THIS C.D IS SUCH A WASTE OF TIME WHY IT WAS MADE I HAVE NO IDEA. AT ONE TIME IT WAS GREAT NOW THEY DO NOT EVEN PLAY IT ON THE RADIO.
3127	Huge Fan: I'm a huge Judith McNaught fan, and have waited impatiently for the past few years for this book to finally be released. I have to admit that it is not her best work, but it is definitely a good book. Judith is an amazing romance writer. She is able to draw you into her characters and make you feel what they are going through. By the end of the book you care about them like they are your own friends or family. From Whitney My Love to Perfect to Night Whispers I've felt a connection with all of her characters. The connection wasn't competely there in Someone to Watch Over Me.What would be nice is for Nicky DuVille to have his own, full length story.
3128	Slam Dunk -- A Great Product that Works!: I have a Rockwell/Delta Table Saw that had always shuddered on start-up and shut down, and had a little vibration at operating speed. I bought this belt, and can now literally stand a nickel on edge on the table saw, and it won't flop over -- the saw works that smoothly. A great improvement. More than willing to pay a little premium for such an improvement.
3129	blue face plate falls off: I bought this watch last year and the blue decorative face plate falls off in time. It also happened on a different Timex watch I bought at the same time. The watch still functions, but doesn't look too cool anymore.
3130	James and the Giant Peach: In my opinion, James and the Giant Peach was not the greatest book, but if you like imaginary things, you might like it. James and the Giant Peach by Roald Dahl describes a boy who finds a giant peach, and it rolls down a hill and ends up in the ocean; he doesnt know how to get it out. To begin, James escapes from his evil aunts house. He wanted to escape because they were mistreating him. Next, when he is in the middle of the ocean, he comes up with this interesting plan. His plan was to tie seagulls to the peach so they would lift him up. Lastly, he arrives at his destination. Aww the life of New York City. Even know I hated this book, I hope you like it.
3131	One very cool replica piece!: I didn't know quite what to expect from looking at the pic, but this is a mini flintlock with working flint hammer and trigger attached to a very safely blunt dagger. It has ornate metal scrolling and and good weight, and is a nice looking piece. Mine had some packing material stuck inside which initially prevented it from cocking but I managed to clean that out and it now works perfectly. This wasn't Prime eligible and as it turned out Seller wouldn't cover return shipping so if I hadn't been able to fix it I'd have paid S&H both ways, which is the only downside. Now I just have to come up with some sort of holster for it.
3132	downtown abbey 2: I love this seris. Can't get enough and plan to buy the Season 2 when it comes out in January.
3133	Way too much hype for such an aggrevating novel: I read other reviews of this story so I knew it would be a challenge; but after getting thru 2/3 of the book (had to switch to audio book to get passed the language ordeal) I still got no feel for the point. I was then even more disgusted by the gratuitous suicides of two of the more interesting characters! Needless to say this will not be on my recommended list.
3134	it's good: no complaints here. durable. gender neutral. fits our needs. our daughter likes it. travels easily. great for the price we paid.
3135	The Next Diva: Absolutely, one of the brightest talents in music today. With the strong voice and the "look", Christina Aguilera will be around for a long time. From the soft "I Turn to You" to the catchy "Come on Over", Miss Aguilera shows that she can handle any type of song that comes her way. Move over Mariah, Celine, and Britney; cause here comes Christina!!! This debut cd is a classic!
3136	Excellent Reading!: These two books are very interesting, informative and exciting to read. JJ has done a great job of making this story compelling and fun to read. I wish all his books were available on the Kindle.
3137	Not worth it: The quality of the materials is very good. However, the craftsmanship was very bad. The corners will not even line up and only one side is actually straight. It would be disrespectful to my family in Slovakia to display or fly this flag.
3138	Waste of time: I saw this movie with 5 other people in a crowded theater. Had I known that I couldn't get a refund after the first 20 mins of the movie start, I would have walked out like a few other people did. Even after the movie, we weren't the only people to ask for a refund. All of us were very frustrated that we wasted 2 hours of our time and almost a year later we still talk about getting that 2 hours back! I thought that perhaps the movie would get better, but it never did. It isn't as if I'm not familar w/abstract-artsy films, but this didn't even accomplish that. It's as if there are major chuncks left out of the story. Now I'll have to read the book for some continuity. All in all, it's one of the very few movies that I wish I never wasted time or money on and I've seen some pretty bad movies.
3139	Poorly Made: My wife and I each bought a Zire 71 and they both failed after about a year. Makes you think the units are made to be disposible. The problem with my wife's was the battery. After a charging it would drain almost immediately. More than likely caused by the camera or joystick(she tried taping the unit shut so it wouldn't slide open but this didn't help). Mine stopped syncing and the touch screen worked eraticly. We owned other Palms which were simpler, better made and lasted longer. The Zire 71 is a disaster!
3140	Another Art Asylum hit: A great likeness of a great character -- and this time one we haven't seen before. Though they are issuing Khan in his gold suit soon, this is the definitive Khan and stands tall in Art Asylum's Classic Trek line -- and that's saying something.
3141	History of the others: The African slave trade is one of the great stains of human history. Much has been written about it by European - white authors, though unfortunately, there are very few recollections of the slave trade by actual slaves. This book is one of those works. The author, Olaudah Equiano, was born in Nigeria and captured as a child and sold of to slavery in the New World. He eventually accummulated enough money to free and educate himself, and make his way thru the world as a free man. This book is his story, told by himself. He retells his kidnapping, his trip from Africa to N. America, his service to different masters, how he bought his own freedom, and then his life as a free man. He retells both the punishments he endured, the work he had to do, and the opportunities denied to him while he was a slave. Overall, a good book to read about the life of a slave.
3142	Better every time!!!: I love amethystium's music. Each cd he has released has suprised me by being better than the last. I have no fear in setting my expectations higher for each release for he never fails to exceed them. Evermind is no exception, it is a beautiful etheral soundscape of transient waves and voices. Oystein Ramjford (amethystium) is a very talented master of mixing and sound. Fans of Animus Mundi will be pleased to hear their vocals on this cd as well as other guest appearences. I had lost interest in new age/world type music but Amethystium brought me back to the fold. My only problem is I can't find anyone else as good. I keep coming back to Ramjford's music over and over again. I bought the first Amethystium cd on a whim and it turned out to be one of the best music purchases in years. You will not regret your decision to give this a try. If you are a fan of this type of music you owe it to yourself to give it a try.
3143	What have you Done for us lately Janet!: I`ve been a fan of Janet since 1986 when Control was released. I have ALL of the albums she has made since then and this one is the worst! There is only One track that stands out which is the single Just A Little While. The first 4 tracks are just a fusion of bland soul music. Janet used to be like Madonna, always an innovator of music...not a follower. Janet was a great album with tracks like Thats the way, Again, If, Throb etc. Velvet Ropes best track was You, a withdrawn release. All For You wasn`t a great album, but the title track,someone to call my lover and Son of a gun...all very different and brilliant! Come on Janet! You CAN do better.
3144	finger combing made easy: I purchased a sample kit with shampoo, conditioner and this mask. Using the 3 items together for the first time left my hair awesomely manageable. I have color treated hair that gets blow dried on a regular basis and it's really not in good condition. After using this product twice I ordered all 3 items in the full size. I have never had a product that let me run my fingers through my hair hours after styling. And shine? I have never had such beautiful shine since I was a child! It doesn't leave my hair heavy or oily; it just leaves it beautiful! Must remember to follow package directions for products to work best.
3145	i love it: This product assures peace of mind knowing that the koi are safe from the herons. This is my second scarecrow. We will see how it works again in the spring!
3146	Offers good sound advice: When I picked up this book, I did not realize that it was so literally about sports betting (though it does wander over to stock picking for a short chapter as well); and if I had, I wouldn't have bought it.But I'm not disappointed. It's a great read and Root's Contrarian approach (find out what the mass asses are doing and make a beeline to do the opposite) has great appeal.In the second half of the book he gives blow by blow, very specific criteria to follow where you bet for the underdog while (Root claims) having the odds on your side. Frankly, I found it fascinating.At the least, it makes for an entertaining read! I did learn a lot from it and had an enjoyable afternoon reading it as well. Root has a GREAT attitude and it really shines through in his book.
3147	This can't be Tonka Joe: We purchased this computer program thinking it would be fun and enjoyable like all the other Tonka Joe adventures. All we found was pure disappointment. My son is very proficient on the computer and easily does Tonka Construction 1 and 2, Tonka Garage, and Tonka Search and Rescue but this program is not only difficult for him but it is even difficult for me and his 12 year old brother. My son still loves Tonka Joe but I am very surprised in the difference in products and was considering Tonka Raceway but now I may even reconsider that purchase.
3148	Potential but Overdone: It's strange that I bought this CD based on a song I didn't like. "I Wanna Love You Forever" is an over-the-top love song that starts off with a catty whisper and then turns into a scream fest with Jessica obviously trying to show off her vocal range. But I do think she has a good voice. Therefore, I bought the CD thinking...rather, hoping this first single was just overdone for the sake of showing of that voice and in the rest of the CD she'd show more control. Boy, was I wrong. I've already given the CD to my friend for her B-day. I still stand by the fact that she has a great voice, but every song is over the top and it sounds like she's screaming her declarations of love instead of singing them. And, even when she is toned down, it all ends up sounding the same. EVERY song is just like the one before it. Jessica has talent, but she needs to collaborate with other people who know how to properly showcase that talent and not make her sound like a Carey/Dion/Houston wannabe.
3149	Not too shabby: Received the memory quickly, installation was simple on my mac book pro (pre-unibody). Found a video on Youtube that stepped me through the process. My mac now runs faster!
3150	Broken before use!: I got a box with no instructions. I put it together as it appeared in the picture. As I was snapping on the main piece that connects the handle to the vaccum piece the cheap plastic snapped. I am trying to hold it together with tape! Hopefully, I'll get my money back! Do NOT buy!
3151	Galinsky is right on the mark -: This is a terrific book! Finally, we have something that deals head-on with parent-child communication from BOTH sides. Galinsky's insight and tips are invaluable. I would recommend this book to anyone who balances going to work and raising children. It's already changed the dynamics between myself and my kids with regard to work.
3152	If I could listen on my iPod, I might bother to be a fan: I was given this as a gift, told I would *LOVE* it, and couldn't wait to get it home and into my iPod's music rotation. Unfortunately, SonyBMG has made that "unauthorized". Imagine that...they've taken a device with a major share of the market and deemed it unauthorized. It seems that should be illegal, doesn't it?I have thousands of artists to choose from...I can live without David Grays' music if Sony continues to try and strongarm me into supporting it's business partners. Buying this CD should NOT obligate me to use .wmf files or rely on Microsoft's MusicMatch Jukebox.I might have been a fan, but I'm not going to go through any trouble.
3153	Gorgeous High Tech Watch: This is an elegant, beautiful watch with a high-tech soul. My husband bought this for me this fall to replace a Bulova; this is a very thin watch that would look great on any wrist. The face is a lovely mother of pearl and the time is easy to read with a quick glance. The only drawback (which isn't really a complaint) is that it doesn't display the date.The Eco-Drive technology is impressive--a solar cell keeps the battery charged.I've had the watch more than 2 months & so far, it keeps perfect time (as expected). I love this watch!! It goes great with casual clothes and even better with "best dressed" evening outfits. A winner all the way!
3154	WONDERFUL: If you care about YOUR loss of freedoms in this country, read this book and do something before its to late!!
3155	Migraine Music - Disk Error?: Warning: After reading other reviews I gave it a shot.However my experience was very poor. Rather than the "Echoes" the title announces, the cd gives 60 minutes of the intense midnight droning of a thousand insects, frogs, and birds using every frequency available to call for a mate.My cd seemed to have a 'skipping' sound through the <10 minutes I listened so there would seem to be an error in the recording. Still I recommend to avoid this cd if not the entire series.Alternatively, I recommend the 'Echoes of Nature: The Natural Sounds of the Wilderness [Box set]' as an excellent value. Also I have found CDs from the 'Sounds of the Earth' series to be of high quality, though of steeper price. Hope this helps.
3156	a fresh new approach to extremely difficult behavior: I just heard this gentleman speak about his "Plan B" . He was easy to listen to. He makes sense. His book makes sense. "Clear the smoke" first - we have to get past everything that we've placed around these children - our feelings, emotions, our "bad" behavior - before we can begin to assess what makes the child act the way s/he does. I love the basket idea - it's so simple, yet makes so much sense. It would work with any child, any issue. REad the book - listen to him speak if you can.
3157	Inspiring: This very small, short book is written in a sensational style that usually turns me off, but the subject -- Walter Russell -- is so exceptional that I could not help but overlook it. This is a man who was an architect of a building still standing in New York city, yet he never went to school past the 8th grade. He sculpted the Mark Twain Memorial, though he never studied art. He even created the Co-op system for housing in New York (but later denounced it as politicians and real estate developers caused the system to degenerate into the state it's in now). I love to pass this book around to friends -- they always appreciate it. I highly recommend this introduction to his highly unusual experiences, philosophy, and unique relationship with the Universe.
3158	Joni Swings Sweet (CD to replace LP): The first time I went to a foreign nation I was right out of the service and I could find only two records in English; "Joni Swings Sweet' LP and a Neil Sadaka LP -this was long before CD's came around. So now I have a GREAT recording of one of my favorite LP's that I can play anytime I like.
3159	Hip hop will never be the same: Soul-junk threw away the rules of hip hop. It's a noisy, chaotic jib-jab of poetry set to glitchy cuts, bad break-beats, symphonic bursts and cut-and-paste rhythms. Soul-junk knows how to spit rhymes, but it's so dense sometimes it detracts from the flow. Highly recommended for fans of underground and indie hip hop. It's too crazy to be a game changer, but it is undeniably legit.
3160	time & setting details somewhat off.: This is the second Lehane I read, it was ok and a fast read but it seemed again that little details are wrong. For instance I don't believe people generally bought coffee at newstands in 1950's. The idea of people walking around drinking coffee is kind of new. I went to college in boston & worked in town in the late 60's and that wasn't typical then even (I'm addicted to coffee so I'd remember). Also he made it seem like those harbor islands are remote and inaccessible. There are little islands all over the place and not too far away from each other. I also wasn't surprised. I will read Mystic River before I see the movie however.
3161	Not up to par...: Big x-files fan here, and this movie was a huge disappointment. Had this been an episode, it would be on the bottom 10 or so.Yes, it was great seeing everyone again, but couldn't they have come up with a decent storyline?No aliens or mutants here - just a completely ridiculous mad scientist plot that made little sense, but did manage to throw in a great deal of gratuitous gore. The movie was almost a horror-fest - but without the suspense.I felt sorry for the actors - and even more sorry for the characters who now just seem dated and a bit deranged.
3162	Researched and original advice: I first read this book over ten years ago when I was in college. I liked the well researched style Molloy uses. His comments and advice can be very blunt, but he makes the point. Much of this excellent advice can not be found in other books.For example he opens with a chapter on how people spot lower socioeconomic level traits in others. I see these things all the time (i.e. slouched posture, mouth resting open.) More importantly he tells you how to change your own style in case this is not something your parents taught you. The chapter on table manners is enough to buy the book.I have been in the professional world for ten years now and still recall and use something from this book at least once a month.
3163	Like totally stupid, man!: Like, the dude, he's such a...like, a dude, man!...Whatever - this movie really stank. The only part I thought was clever was that his only form of ID was a Ralph's card.
3164	Best one of the lot: I read several in this series and was somewhat disappointed because of the tawdry behavior of the heroine. In comparison, this very first one has been a real pleasure to read. It has some genuinely funny places and Agatha comes across as endearing and someone you would really enjoy getting to know. She is a modern Miss Marple. Just what I had been hoping for in this series but had not gotten until now.
3165	It's All About the Music: Although Morris isn't much of a vocalist, his instrumentation and arrangements make this collection a worthwhile purchase. 'Flight School' is a dynamic example of standard surf double-picking played in the lower range, and 'Pipeline' adds just the right degree of individual flare while retaining the intrinsic appeal of the Chantays original. A pleasant suprise (one I thought I'd never see) was finding a superb rendition of the Virtues 1959 hit 'Guitar Boogie Shuffle', here entitled 'Arthur's Boogie'. Morris made an excellent choice in selecting the R&B classic 'I Only Have Eyes For You' to add a touch of romantic melancholia to the mix. Finally, the slide guitar and minimal lyrics on the final number, 'Stop Teasing Me', make this tune invigorating. I first heard this band on an internet radio surf channel. In fact, the Danny Morris reportoire is a moderately successful mixed-bag of pop with surf leanings.
3166	A disappointing toy from Leap Frog: I am a big fan of Leap Frog products, but I am very disappointed in this toy. My son is five months old and he is not entertained by this learning gym in the least. He can touch the mobile, but that interests him for about two minutes. When I try to help him sit up, he still has trouble reaching the globe. I am hoping that in a few more months, he will enjoy some of the other features of this toy, such as the peekaboo mirror. Until then, this gym is pointless while he is lying down. Perhaps more flashing lights would have entertained him in this mode. The manufacturer's recommendation for this toy to be used by children as early as three months is completely erroneous in my opinion.
3167	Best Backpack in 5 years: My daughter is in the 5th grade, so we needed a backpack with a great support system. This backpack holds everything she needs without breaking her back or cutting into her shoulders. The shoulder straps are very well padded and the suspension system distributes the weight of the backpack evenly. I highly recommend this product.
3168	slide: overall the gun is great feels good heavy and abs plastic so it wont break easily only downfall to this gun is that i was hoping the slide would be metal but besides that everything else is good so i give this a 4 out of 5 starts
3169	NO SURPRISE...: A NEW ALBUM WITH NO SURPRISES... we are waiting for a good return to soul in seventies as good as love hangover, and all albums in these years... only and always "remakes" and compilations out of the ross'talent... think she's going to sleep now... blues is good of course, but all soul stars go to this style, and we need to dance on good music now... please diana "stand up and dance now", you're still (??) a soul voice but we don't need a return and perpetual rererereturn...joel - france...
3170	Didn't Last: Received quickly and in good condition, but after only a month, started getting printer cartridge errors. The black cartridge appeared to be leaking somewhat.
3171	Access Developers Handbook rules: It's simple. This is the best book on the market. Buy it. You'll wonder how you ever lived without it.
3172	VERY PRETTY: VERY GOOD VALUE AFTER COMPARING OTHER PRICES. PERHAPS IT COULD BE A BIT LARGER FOR A LARGER WRIST.
3173	Book light: this is good for reading a book in a tent and that's about it......................batts last about 10 hours, and cost 10 bucks to replace lol
3174	Only One Hit: The first song is really the only good song. It has it moments here and there but overall not worth the purchase.
3175	works great: works just as it should.simple and effective.i'd recommend this to someone who wants to keep the original signal-wiring in tact.poor man's subwoofer installation kit.
3176	Not as hoped, but the first step: More text is given to newspaper publishing, and disappointingly little to books. Good reads on publishers, and finding the common threads of experience for many of these printer/ publishers. I was hoping for more on book production, and book ownership, but both were not as strong. It is well written, clearly organized, well illustrated. For those interested in these topics, the bibliography is also of interest.
3177	streaming video constant lag: Every 30 seconds or so it paused and said it was connecting. Not cool. Can't imagine buying another instant video from here.
3178	Depressing instead of funny: A huge fan has been let down. I found most of the stories sad - pathetic - depressing - and kept getting the creeping feeling that Mr. Sedaris is mining for gold in a place where all the nuggets have already been removed. One HUGE laugh in the chapter about snow in the Carolinas (his name for muddy snowmen); the chapter on his brother's wedding was also hilarious. The rest were odd, creepy, and left me feeling somewhat dirty.
3179	so great I called Biore hunting for this: I suffer from an oily forehead...in the sense that I can reflect global warming if I wanted to! This product is the ONLY face moisturizer I've ever used that does not have that effect. I was so sad when they discontinued this! I called Biore and went on a hunt for it. I'm so happy I found it here! It truly is the best, and you don't need to use as much of it. It may seem like a really small bottle, but it lasted me a long time.
3180	Cool device, TERRIBLE customer service.: This is a decent product. I bought it because my sound card blew out. The only thing I didn't like about the product itself is that you cannot use a 1/8 splitter. I have 2 sets of speakers that I had plugged in with my regular sound card using a Radioshack 1/8 splitter. When you plug the splitter into the device, only one set of speakers will work. Other than that, the product is great and a real life saver if your sound card blows.The main issue I have with the company is that I bought the product and a few days later there was a $2 price drop. I emailed the company and asked for the difference and I never got a response. By law in the state of Michigan, if you buy something within 30 days and the price drops, you have the right to receive the lower price. Now even if that's not the law everywhere, its still good customer service. I won't buy anything from this company ever again.
3181	Dull & Boring: I found this book to be extremely dull and boring! It was written by someone whose primary language was not English. One had to read some paragraphs 3 times and still was not sure what they meant to say. The paintings were not too great either.
3182	Great fun for the historiclly literate: What makes the Onion so great, both as a satirical newspaper and in this book, is that they are tremendously well-versed in the historical and current events that they skewer so wonderfully. To their credit, they assume that their readers are, too.Contemporary readers will chuckle at headlines such as 'Clinton Feels Nation's Pain, Breasts,' but the history buff will revel in satirical stories poking fun at many early-century figures and institutions that less adventurous satirists would have left alone. I can't think of many writers aside from the Onion who would have tried to get laughs out of a story about how racy the Sears catalog lingerie section has become.
3183	Does not work with any Garmin GPS with micro SD RAM: Unfortunately, like many others, I did not read the reviews here before ordering this bicycle mount for my Garmin Vista eTrex HCx. The battery cover for the Garmin eTrex models that use a micro SD memeory card is shaped differently, and this mount does not fit. I notified Amazon and I hope they update their information.
3184	Teen Girls Beware: This book may be fine writing and may have great characters, but I was disappointed to find that in the first few pages, we see a young girl basically experiencing rape at the hands of her new "husband". My daughter is 12 years old, and perhaps the author thinks that 12 year olds are ready for this type of writing. The writing was explicit enough that it made my daughter uncomfortable. Parents, please pre-read this book to make sure that it is appropriate for your teen daughter.
3185	Once an Excellent Resource, but Out of Date Now: I read this book years ago as a part of my preparation to become an LLL Leader, and it was very thorough and a great read. But now, sadly, so much has happened in the field of lactation that this book is really out-of-date, and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. Luckily, the author, Nancy Mohrbacher, has written a newer version called Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple, which was published in 2010. I highly recommend that anyone interested in the Breastfeeding Answer Book purchase Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple. Same author, same concept, but so much more up-to-date.
3186	DO NOT BUY!!!: After waiting three weeks for this movie. I tried it on my PS3, my computer and my blu-ray player and none of them would except it. I am highly disappointed in this product. DO NOT BUY.
3187	Don't sleep on a cheezy cover!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: For starters lemme start out by saying that i slept on this book for 2 yrs b/c honestly if that is supposed to be a picture of Milton, the main characters boyfriend, 1 he aint cute and 2 he look like a dyke not even a man. And too me the cover is just cheezy looking, however this book was excellent. At first i couldn't see how this book could have so many twists and so much evil could happen to the main character but i must say all in all she overcame everything and good things come to those who wait. I understand Milton was abused but what he did to Myra was unforgivable and it was sad but things like this really happen. If you sleeping on the cover like i was don't immediately pick this up and read now. It kind of reminds me of "Harlem girl lost" by Treasure E. Blue just the way the turn of events took place. Go buy and read!!!!!!!!!!!!
3188	A well written tongue-in-cheek review of television insights: After a long day at work this is the kind of book many professionals will enjoy picking up for a light trip down TV's memory lane. The psychological insights into so many of the popular 70's, 80's and 90's TV shows are hilarious.
3189	Another Blah.....: I'm the worlds biggest Tom Clancy fan. I'm now through two books in a row that have been lousy. Red Rabbit was bad. This one is bad too. It reads like an Op-Center book. Quick, predictable and somewhat hard to believe. Jack Ryan jr. and his twin cousins all by chance end up at the same covert operations center? Wow, what a coincidence. I still think there's a multiple book contract we're trying to fulfill. Where's Red Storm Rising or Executive Orders or The Sum of All Fears? I miss the depth of these immediate classics and I'm still waiting
3190	Love This Show: I'm on Season 11 - I've watched them all from beginning to end. A great show I vaguely remember from my childhood, but didn't quite understand (I was 7-11 years old). I'm glad I decided to watch these, and that they were available for free on Amazon Prime.
3191	Works well: works very well, but its a freakin toothbrush, unless you have teeth problems dont spend$100+ dollars (or ur rich) i mean its really not that great or worth it, just get a $20 one instead if you want to blow your money...
3192	LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!: I love this poster! It was cheap and arrived shortly! Great poster stock that it was printed on. I took it to our local picture guy and had it framed with a gel coat put over it! Looks high dollar and I got it for cheap. Great buy!
3193	Good gift that many people do not have: Wonderfull. My trunk gets all sorts of things and the more I can put in a case the better.
3194	muuhda can handuw dey bidness: Muuhda freakin rocks it straight to the taint.This album is definatly going to end world hunger,debt bondage, and child prostitution.
3195	Putting a New Coat of Paint on the Great Malefic: Liz Greene has done a wonderful job of dealing with the Great Malefic of ancient times, Saturn. Her book is one of the first to challenge the older ways of reading planets in natal interpretation. Greene's background as a Jungian analyst AND an astrologer gives her books depth, insight and credibility. You will learn, for example, that Saturn contacts in synastry guaranty a successful marriage because Saturn is required to provide the long term staying power!This book is a must in your astrological library. It can be well understand by an intermediate astrology student and it is an excellent building block for later interpretation skills, Saturn being the important planet it is, the timer, the teacher, and so forth.
3196	DON'T BUY!!: I bought the subscription in June 2010 and haven't received any magazines so far. I sent couple of email asking for status and got no response. I am very disappointed about this purchase. Save your money, look else for National Geographic subscription.
3197	Irritating: I am not an idiot. Far from it. However, I can't understand the glowing praise I see this book receiving. As I am currently working through this text, I may be a bit closer to home than those who have completed the task.I am seriously less than fond of this book. There doesn't seem to be enough background in the material to handle the problems. This is most noticeable in the middle chapters. There are problems which are flat out insoluble if you utilize only the material in the book. There are problems are so far beyond the examples given in the body of the chapter as to leave you swimming for a method to solve them.I am presently searching for secondary companion books that will present the material in such a fashion that I don't have to count on blind luck intuitive leaps of logic to solve the problems, but rather on solid problem solving methodology.
3198	Depressing: While Tony is one of the best singers of any century, the song selection is not too "christmasy." Actually I found it depressing and annoying. I was disappointed and surprised. ADVICE: Stick with any other Tony album!
3199	Big Bubble Bursting BUMMER: This book is devastating. I struggled so hard to read the first 50 pages. I learned about his thesis: Market Populism.BUT, the witty, tongue-in-cheek, op-ed type voice is extremely difficult to read and unbelievably redundant. Its like reading a million witty, sharp-tongued op-ed pieces. Great point he's trying to make, but amazingly frustrating to read.
3200	More greats from a great band!: Here are some more classic TJB tunes, some which aren't available anywhere else. This collection includes Alpert's classic "This Guy's In Love With You", the only vocal of his that was any good. Also included is one song from his Brazilian LP WARM (Zazueira), and one song from his jazzier TJB from 1974 (Last Tango In Paris) where Herb does some great trumpet playing! There are some concert favorites here, too! "Wade In The Water" wasn't a big hit, but was popular in concert. There's not a dud in this collection. Highly recommended!
3201	shortlived coffee maker: I purchased this coffeemaker for our school to use for large groups. It was used about 6 times and then it quit working. We were very careful to not immerse the pot in water, and one day it just quit working. I would not buy another pot by this company.
3202	Escort Passport 8500 X50: This radar seems to be super sensitive in selecting its target radar. I received it very quickly in a well packaged carton and installed it the same day. It's been protecting the family ever since. There are very few false warnings in the city. I haven't had it on a long road trip yet but expect it to perform admirably.
3203	A New Style of Music: This is a really refreshing style of Music. I do not speak Spanish but I know ALL these beautiful Gospel Songs and would like to be able to sing them in Spanish. What a Great Way to learn! This is the most interesting style of Music I have ever heard and the piano and guitar are just great.
3204	BUY THIS SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: If your going to buy a Dreamcast this fall,don't. Look at Sony's increidible Playstation 2. Sure the price is steap but look at what you are getting:a DVD player,a Music CD player,and a new playstation that also plays old playstaion 1 games. You are crazy not to buy this system! Look at Metal Gear Solid 2.Those are the best graphics I have ever seen in a video game. Sonys got lots of luck ahead of them.Get ready for the bigest system launch in the history of america whether you like it or not!
3205	a drier version of People's History of the United States: While I agree with the concepts expressed in the book, it wasn't a complete joy to read. At times, it reminded me of a textbook. However, the subject matter was covered in much richer detail with more exposition and "character development" than I've come across recently in any other nonfiction book about American history.I'd recommend this book to people who enjoy Howard Zinn but want more detail.
3206	This is a CUTE movie!!: Reese Witherspoon shines in this movie. She plays a sophiscated character and smarter than her role in Legally Blonde (not that I didnt LOVE it) Reese Witherspoon plays a high-profile fashion design from New York, although she's really just a southern girl who got married right out of high school. After she decides she's tying the knot with the son of the governor of New York, she has to go settle some unsettled business; her marriage with Jake, her highschool sweetheart from the south. While there, she finds her true feelings for Jake and finds that her beau back in NY is not the one for her. Completely cute movie! A MUST-SEE! I've seen it 3 times and enjoyed every one!
3207	Disappointment: I felt this book was poorly written. The first part was good; It drew me into the story. However when I got to the last 3-4 chapters, there was so much going on that was never developed properly. It seemed like the author got tired of writing and just "dumped" a bunch of ideas all at the end.
3208	Cheap Junk: The pump looks alright and comes with the standard set of needles and adapters. It broke after pumping up 2 tires. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and get something durable. This thing is little more than junk.T
3209	Very short. Very good.: This book has 44 superb writing tips, but only 26 pages. Is that a problem? No. There are more comprehensive legal-writing guides. There are broader treatments of legal-writing style. And there are surely longer books. But there are none as short and to-the-point as this one. It's clear and easy to read, but most lawyers could spend years implementing its excellent advice.
3210	Like Dandelion Dust: Wow! What a story!! I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was never sure how it would end. I love all Karen Kingsbury books. I love the way this story is current as well as it could have happened in any era. I'm not sure what I would have done had I been in the same situation as Molly, but I found myself thinking the same. This story shows how no matter how we make plans, the Lord is in control.
3211	It's not a horror novel, it's a horrible novel!: Although Lovecraft's book is interesting when read as a psychyatrical case study, it lacks even the most basic elements of the horror genre. The fact that there is no central character with which one can associate and sympathise is one of the worst features of The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward for it prevents the reader from being involved in the story (something that the horror novel needs to do to captivate the reader).Still, I believe that this book is worth reading (127 quick pages). But it's a shame that Lovecraft did not have a litterary skill that matched his spectacular imagination.
3212	Love this tea kettle!: I love this kettle. The way it is designed, you don't burn yourself when you pour. You don't burn yourself when you open the lid. It has a loud annoying whistle that you is hard to ignore, which is good for my 80 year old mother. I have bought this one for myself, and my mother twice(she burned up one despite the whistle)!
3213	THE ONLY TRAVEL BOOK FOR HAWAII YOU NEED TO USE: This book is an excellent guide to all of Hawaii. From the great maps to the history, people, government, arts and music, and even the language. This is not your usual travel guide - it has so much info in it going above and beyond any other travel guide to the Islands.It is a thick book to take with you, but well worth it. You will not be disappointed.
3214	Couldn't finish: I tried to read this book on three seperate occasion, several months apart. I have finally given up. I made it to page eighty or so this time and threw the book across the room in agitaion after nearly an entire page of rambling about the way the main character seperated her trash. Nothing engaged me in the story and I did not like any of the characters. My apologies to the author for the harshness of this review, but I can't change the way I feel.
3215	hot,hot,hot: it is a rather different love story,wth passion, betrayal and devotion finally.I think it s the hottest move in both jolie`s and Banderas's filmographies.She is a femme fatale.As being a big fan of hers I loved the movie.
3216	great movie: this movie is always a great movie, the action the story just fun to watch. Bourne is great is figuring out problems and going after those involved.
3217	What a Great Collection!: The Coop project, which is titled "Turn of the Century," is a wonderful collection of artists. I got this cd via a friend, and I have been playing it nonstop! The artists are not very famous, but they are fantastic...from the beautiful melodies of Don Jackson, to the poetry of Billy Sochko to the haunting beauty of Kathy V.'s voice, this album is one I would recommend to anyone who wants to hear good, new music.
3218	House Beautiful: I have yet to receive my first issue. I am looking forward to receivingmy first issue, which was to arrive in January, but no word yet, and it'stoday the 28th of January.
3219	Excellent: It is of course a matter of taste if you prefer this, or the Dave Holland Big Band.But the two units do share Holland's trademarks: long chord progressions that go far beyond the length of traditional cadance, abstract rhythm and melodies, and of course, Holland's simple bass playing beneath the complication.The two big band albums,What Goes AroundandOvertimeare modern masterpeices which I am partial to for their torrents of abstraction, master playing and sound. But the vibraphone here and the dynamic drumming, and of course Dave's clear as a country stream lines. make this album far more than enough.
3220	Not taking sufficient Western responsibility: Bernard Lewis's book is an exercise in blameshifting away from the West and towards the Middle East. He rightly points out Arab responsibility in reaching the current situation, but uses his substantial knowledge to understate the importance and influence of the West in shaping the current and recent political make-up of the region. His description of religious rigidity is overexaggerated and he seems unaware both of the substantial amount of critical Islamic scholars present in the Middle East and the limited influence of religious law in practice in most 'Islamic' countries. His regular thesis of Arab 'rage' and disappointment over lost status is part of an easy thesis that tries to partially simplify the Middle East-West tension to hysterical psychological undervelopment on the part of the Arabs. For people interested in finding out about violent forms of minority muslim fundamentalism, this is a particular bad read.
3221	Beautiful...It really is that term "gem": I thought upon buying this album I'd hear the usual indie wannabe beach boys sound but this record blew me away! Its no faker! I would say this reminds me of the beach boys and other classic 60's bands but everyone says that about these bands nowadays. "When Your Heartstrings Break" has the whole work of instruments and the band CAN play them. The lyrics are silly and catchy. This record is like a beautiful summer day with a glass of your favorite cooling drink and a nice book. Not much of this comes around, So get it now!
3222	This is an outrage!: This was a sequel? I found inaccuracies and inconsistencies as early as the second page! How insulting it is to think the author didn't think we'd notice! Did Ms. Tennant even read P&P? Not only were the ages wrong, but the personalities weren't even close to being true to the characters established by its predecessor. I was so frustrated by this book I returned it the next day. This was clearly just an attempt to cash in on the notoriety and reputation of Jane Austen's work.
3223	The same old stuff again!!: How many more 'greatest' hits albums can one artist produce before his fans start crying foul? The absurdity here is almost reaching Jimi Hendrix levels. Unfortunately, now instead of getting to hear some of the songs that I enjoy from Bruce like 'Badlands' or 'Tenth Avenue Freeze Out', I have to listen to literally 20 minutes of band introductions. Hey, if I want to meet the band, I will look at and then read the inside of the CD cover! I would be very surprised if anyone outside of the New Jersey area or maybe one of the nearby depressing poser towns like Allentown, PA actually enjoys this CD. Bruce is better then this and it hurts!
3224	Meandering Plot... *Yawn*: I thought the idea of this story was truly original. I did not, however, enjoy the writing skills of Diana Wynne Jones or the slowness of the storyline at times. Diana is able to portray characters very well with description, but she doesn't make the characters feel like "real" people. Also, her writing style is very confusing at times. At some points in the story you don't know who the person narrating is. It switches off from person to person without really notifying you. Overall, I found the book to have an original concept but a dragging and complicated storyline.
3225	Not Impressed....: I have a small house and the layout makes it hard to watch tv late at night without disturbing my toddler and husband. After suffering many sleepless nights where I would have to strain to hear the tv, sometimes not being able to hear it at all when the heater was on, I bought headphones. I decieded on these because of the design and price. The work ok but will spontaenously turn off creating a VERY loud static sound. This is not very nice to hear when you are falling asleep. Sometimes it would take three or four times resetting them before I'd get an hour or two of uninterrupted time. Not worth the price due to the performance.
3226	A soft little...wow...as subtle as the surge of the sea: Powerful and lyrical tale told with admirable restraint and understatement. Hints and innuendo propel the six characters of The Marriage of the Sea between the two irresistibly romantic settings of Venice and New Orleans as fluidly as a sleek sailboat upon the waves. This ornate and complex novel explores aging and decay (physical, spiritual, and architectural), marriage, barrenness in its many manifestations, lonliness, and the complex nature of relationships.A piece of writing as finely drawn as the lines of Venitian canals and as richly layered as the levels of New Orleans society.A winner. May Jane Alison write many more this good.
3227	MAD MAN. MADDENING DIRECTOR. GOOD READ.: Kazan may well have been one of Hollywood's most hated men --- in 1952, he "named names" of peers and pals that were Communists during McCarthy's maniacal manhunt, something for which almost no one forgave him; so strong was Hollywood's hatred that when Kazan was chosen, in 1999, to receive an Honorary Oscar, he was publicly condemned as a traitor. But there's no arguing that Kazan was also a damn good director. (Think On the Waterfront, Gentleman's Agreement, A Face in the Crowd.) Noted film scholar Richard Schickel has penned a frank, unflinching biography, as smart as it is shrewd. Schickel's decision to put Kazan's decried decision into the context of its time and the director's life illuminates the personalities and preoccupations of the man who reshaped the way we look at theater and film.
3228	If I could give it ZERO stars, I would: My CX4600 died within a year of purchase, following numerous expenditures on ink, much like every other reviewer on this site. When it died, I started using my sister's printer -- an EPSON C84. It has now displayed the same symptoms. In my mind, the blank page/full ink cartridge phenomenon borders on fraud, or at a minimum, unacceptably poor design. I will not purchase an EPSON product again.
3229	Hullo? There's life outside the library: Boorstin is not an original thinker, but a representative of a new disturbing intellectual trend. Instead of presenting us with his own original thoughts, he has kneaded together a dough of old ideas and philosophers that does not rise because it lacks the catalyst of imagination. Boorstin and his ilk are the literary equivalent of the disco dub machine, endlessly reworking old melodies to a new beat that sounds like all the other new beats.
3230	All his 80s hits are here!: If you liked the young, brash Corey Hart that hit the stage with "Sunglasses At Night" way back in 1983, you'll love this CD. All those early hits--"Never Surrender", "Eurasian Eyes", and "It Ain't Enough" among my faves--are here.This is 80s nostalgia from one of Montreal's own at its best.
3231	A CLASSIC FROM PECKINPAH!!: I can't wait to see this movie in HD. I purchased the standard version last year but ended up selling it. The bloody shootout at the end is one of the all time great and influential gun fights ever filmed. Yes it's violent, gruesome and over the top but what else would expect from the late great Peckinpah! The cast led by aging Hollywood's golden boy William Holden is also first rate!! Straw Dogs is still me favourite film of his but I rank this a very close second. Enjoy!!!
3232	Required reading for my In-Laws: This book should be required reading for every person in America. Especially my misguided, conservative, reactionary ummmm friends. And family. I'm thinking of bringing this book to thanksgiving dinner. Or just leaving an anonymous gift for everyone in my wifes family under the christmas tree. It's a brilliant compilation that exposes the lies and the liars.
3233	one of the worst books ever written: I had to read this book for my honors Theatre class, and let me tell you it is the most boring book ever! Sure, the author had some good points, but he didn't need to drone on and on about them forever! Nearly no one in my class liked the book. We especially didn't enjoy his comment "Go beat your wife and kids". there are far better books out there. Do Not read this book! The only other books as bad as this one are "The Scarlet Letter" and "Walden"
3234	Hey, I'm not complaining: While I was a little skeptical about running this at first, I am very very glad that I did. The new features are definately worth it, and it makes many tasks much easier than in 98. BUT... the only problem that I have had with it, is that some programs that worked well in 98 or 95 just arent supported in XP. So be warned: if you are running reeeeeallly important stuff on your computer, do the diagnostic thing at the beginning of installation and MAKE DARN SURE that none of your VITAL programs are listed under the "we cant run this in XP" (or whatever) section. Another good idea, if you can afford to, is to get the full version, wipe your harddrive (save your important files), and install it on a clean disk. The upgrade is like remodeling your house: the same wires and plumbing will be there, just pretty new wallpaper. Go for the full version; your computer will boot and run soooooooooooooo much faster.
3235	perfect condition: My book came in in the exact condition as stated and arrived just as promised. Very happy with this seller
3236	A bad film in a disappointing genera: really no stars: It's too bad that spoofs of the James Bond films tend to be so very bad. Both print and television have done quite well making hip fun of Bond and his imitators, but movies made with the same idea consistantly come up short. Some of them are a lot of fun, even if they don't hold together. Some are completely unwatchable. Modesty Blaise comes somewhere in the middle. It isn't actually revolting, but it's nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is.Fans of the Modesty Blaise comic strip and novels should avoid this film like the plague. This isn't Modesty, or Willie, any more than the Matt Helm films are adaptations of the Matt Helm books. People unfamilliar with the other Modesty material may find this film mildly enjoyable, but would be better off with the Flint movies, which come as close as anything ever done to making a success of this idea.
3237	Amazing!: Another collection of short stories and another rave review. Just reading the list of writers who read Nelson (including Michael Chabon, Dave Eggers and David Foster Wallace to name a few) would be enough to convince me to do the same if I wasn't already a fan of hers from her articles in the New Yorker. She's won a ridiculous number of awards and is obviously a highly acclaimed author. If that's not enough to make you read this book, do so because she writes about real people, with real problems and real flaws, and she makes you encompass yourself in their own lives. And that is a tremendous accomplishment.
3238	Showvision: I use to have one of these units long ago so I could view my slides before using my slide projector. I know that I jumped the gun on this one, because I had four boxes of slides that I wanted on DVD and didn't have a way to seperate them. When the slides come back I will be able to pick out which ones I want, and according to subject matter. This unit will difintely alow me to do this. A very good, inexpensive unit for my needs.
3239	Predictions that didn't come true: I just started reading this book, and it's one of the funniest things I've ever read. First of all, there was no nuclear disaster in Norway in 1995. Also, there was no special microchip created at the end of the last century. No mysterious figure whose chip is supposedly implanted into everybody enabling control over the human race. How anyone could read this first book and take this man seriously is beyond me. This man is a fraud and I would really appreciate having back the hour I just wasted in reading this nonsense.
3240	Funny and Charming Tale: Our family loves all of the Arthur and D.W. stories, and this book seems to have particular resonance at this time, as two of my three kids are picky eaters. My four-year-old, my three-year-old, and my two-year-old all like to hear this story over and over again.
3241	great little rocker, with great sound: I bought this rocker for my 15-month-old son's 2nd Christmas, and he likes it a lot. He loves the neighing and galloping sounds that come from the rocker when you press the horse's ears, and he thinks he can't rock on it without the sounds first coming on! I love that there was NO assembly required. It's very soft and sturdy. It's the perfect height for a 1-2 year-old, and I like knowing that if he loses his balance he won't fall far. He is still getting the hang of getting on, but can get off easily. The toy says it is geared toward ages 1-3, but I would say age 3 is too old for this toy--by then a child will be too tall to really get much out of rocking on it. But for those of you wanting a safe rocker for your toddler, this is the way to go!
3242	It's very relaxing: I put in the music when i need to relax, even if i'm working on the computer. It is soothing and helps me calm down..i recommend this cd.
3243	Not a good read...a good one to avoid.: This was a challenging book to finish. I cannot believe that this book was written by a woman author in the 21st century. (It resembled a novel that was written by a man whom wanted to keep women under his thumb. Yuck.) The main character was spineless...she accepted ungracious and rude behavior from her whining, insolent daughter and boring chauvenistic husband. As a 62 year-old woman, I was disappointed to read a porttrayal of such weak, ineffective characters. I can honestly say I will never be inclined to read another of this author's novels, because the development and execution of the women characters was truly embarrassing. Also, just from an aesthetic point of view, the audio version has weird telephone conversation sounds effects. Really a bad imitation of a phone tone. All in all, both print and audio are bad.
3244	Coherent like a dead buffalo: Yes, like a dead buffalo. Compared to every other math book I have used, this one was was the least understandable. First of all, not enough examples. Second, the examples do not show how to apply the principles. I found myself using complex variables for scientists written by polouras (or something like that) in order to understand what on earth was going on. I highly recommend the poluouras book.
3245	Horrible: This stock was absolutely terrible. I bought this stock even after reading all the bad reviews out of hope that I would be one of the lucky ones. Not the case...after spending over an hour filing to get the barrel to set SOMEWHAT down in the stock, I realized that the stock is warped significantly to the right. If you buy one of these stocks, it really is a crap shoot from everything I've read.
3246	His weakest CD but his voice saves it: On Love & Consequences, Gerald LeVert makes a few overtures to hip-hop, but he remains, in his heart, a sensitive loverman -- which is both a good and bad thing. LeVert is a powerful, soulful vocalist who can deliver love ballads as well as any of his contemporaries, but he doesn't always exhibit much musical imagination. "No Sense" may have cameos from rappers Layzie Bone and Ken Dawg, and "That's the Way I Feel About You" is a duet with Mary J. Blige, but they only illustrate that LeVert is from the old school and doesn't really have the desire to bring his music into the present. Which means, of course, that Love & Consequences isn't much different than any other LeVert album from the '90s -- it has a slight modern sheen, but it's a quiet storm album at its heart. It doesn't offer any surprises, but LeVert is a professional -- and that means there are enough solid songs here to make it enjoyable, but not quite enough to make the entire album memorable.
3247	what happened to my review?: Several days ago to be helpful, I wrote and submitted a review of this album mentioning its Latin Grammy selection as "Best Brazilian Album" but days later it isn't on the album page, just two very general, not very specific reviews. Why was my review axed? It doesn't exactly motivate customers to do more ...Paul A. Sundberg"Airshifter Paul"Los Angeles, CA
3248	stops itching but does not cure seborrheic dermatitis: i am using this shampoo almost 3 weeks it stopped itching but does not help my seborrheic dermatitis. therefore coal tar causes can cause cancer so i am going to throw away these shampoo. just waste of money
3249	Making the real connections in the obesity problem: Anyone who can't cope with her direct approach - get over it.Anyone who doesn't like hearing that there are things wrong with the world - open your eyes and ears.Anyone who still thinks that shovelling tons of meat into our bodies to lose weight is a sensible approach - get a grip.This book tells it like it is, and joins the dots in so many ways. It moves beyond the simplistic "lose weight by..." message and shows us how the mind-shapers, politicians, corporates, and even just those of us who are too apathetic to care all contribute to planetary and personal ill-health and flabbiness. It's not an easy message - it's not a "get slim quick" fix - far from it - but it's REAL, and it's about time somebody spoke out in the way that Susan Powter is doing.If you can't take the message here, your head's in the sand, and you need to read this book urgently.
3250	Poor Quality: This item has a wonderful design. However, the instructions are poor (for example, you have to flip the entire stand over between steps but they do not instruct you to do so--interpreting the pictures points this out). I was short one lock washer. One of the nuts inside the metal bar was stripped and thus non-functioning. The stand is very good looking, but whoever makes this (certainly not Samsung themselves) needs a new Quality Manager (hmmm...maybe it is time for my promotion). Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I believe I have stuck to the facts. By the way, I may be wrong, but my guess would be that the weight limit is a little underrated. Thank you.
3251	Not Hot, Not Erotic: Symphony X left me cold. The book is not hot, nor is it erotic. It was as though I was reading some text for a class on how to not sexually stimulate someone. Understand, the book has a lot of sex scenes --and the writer does try to give it to you graphically. But I never felt the pull. I never got inot the main character. I never cared about anything that happened. The tale of self-discovery left me wondering why anyone would want to know this woman or her friends and companions. Save me from bad erotica....There's enough bad sex in the world....don't import it in your home if you don't have to!
3252	Poor Effort: I am disappointed with the poor and almost juvenial presentation of the material which almost resembled jumbled research notes. I will stay clear of this author in the future.
3253	Wish I read the reviews before wasting my money: I was excited about this book but by page 100 I was done. It was too much work keeping track of characters that are not interesting. The awkward writing style is impossible - it must have lost something in the translation. Wish I'd read reviews before wasting my money!
3254	Another installment where nothing happens...: What started off as a great fantasy series has now sunk to damn near unreadable. I barely got by book 8, had to mostly skim through book 9 and once again had to skim through book 10. Perrin & Mat are the primary foci of this book, yet nothing really happens with them either. Rand barely appears. Too many characters do appear in the book whose names I've long forgotten. The end is nowhere in sight, excepting that I think "Crossroads" has finally pushed me over the brink of giving up on the series.On a brighter note, I have begun to re-read The Eye of the World and am greatly enjoying it. I look forward to the re-reading the next six books, which were truly great works, but this time, I'll just stop there.
3255	not what i expected: I didn't' get these strips from amazon, I got them from Wal Mart. I used them correctly. It worked a little, but not as much as some video's online or like some people's pictures. not impressed.
3256	Good Guy, Bad Book: Ya, sure Mandela is a great person, a personification of a accumulation of moral and ethical supremeness, but lets face it, this book sucks. I had to read this for a high school english class, and it bored me to death. So many facts, so many potentially useless information, its as if Mandela intentionally tried to put emphasis on the less entertaining portions in his life. Personally, I dont see how all the other commentors could stand finishing this book. Good story...badly written.
3257	Harryhausen Classic: One of the best films to feature Ray Harryhausen's "Dynamation" stop-motion photography, with a well-handled story with interesting characters bolstering the excellent photography and effects. The giant crab is a standout!
3258	Totally rocks: This is a surprisingly cute yet funny tale of fate and the things love drives us to do.
3259	Completely useless!: This book is completely useless. The only people this would be good for is those that do not have internet access. It is not comprehensive at all and the information could easily be obtained online and it would be alot more complete. I guess I'm not sure what I was expecting but I thought that it would be a lot more informative on how do deal with family issues and the like with having destination weddings which it does not. If you need (outdated)venue information this is the book for you. Otherwise, obtain your information online, for FREE!
3260	Meh!: I guess it didn't stink on ice. But no one apparently ever sat down and worked out what the film was supposed to be. If it was supposed to be an exercise in making a new silent film in the old style, it just didn't happen. And who would care, anyway, outside of a film class assignment.If it was supposed to be a new form of silent film, at least it wasn't the classic style. But again, who cares? It wasn't any kind of new story. Tiresome.If it was supposed to be a film about the silent film era, it was seriously marred by the inept attempt to emulate the old silent genre.Yes, it won Oscars. But note that you can win Oscars any day with a halfway competent film about the film industry. SAG people are such narcissists.So, meh! You'll probably want to see it, just because... But don't expect much.
3261	Goodie: Bingo! I liked this one. Almost as much as "A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football."I highly recommend both. Roll Tide!
3262	Missed the edge it could have had. . .unfortunately: This book could have found an edge, peering into the college youth and their habits, twists and early, media aged wisdom. Instead, it borders on a thirty year too late ideal of what college would have been like, had it been cut up and played out on the movie screen for exactly 90 minutes; no variation of the actual youth of today. Want edge? Read Bukowski.
3263	Four stars for good writing and an interesting idea: For some reason this one never appealed to me as much as the usual JH horror stuff, like 'The Rats', 'The Dark' etc. However I was pleasantly surprised. Not your standard horror book but certainly delves into life and death, a topic which fascinates most of us.The story is told in the first person (or should that be the first dog?) and the author conveys being a dog brilliantly.We learn how 'Fluke' as he is eventually known feels different from other dogs and we follow his journey as he seeks to find out the truth.Wonderfully written and beautifully described...with just the right amount of poignant moments...especially the end.
3264	You don't want it to end: The Phoenix Suns are my favorite sports team and Nash is my favorite player. That being said, this book is far more than a puff piece on the team. McCallum spend a good chunk of the season and playoffs with the team and coaches. It's cool to hear the coaches' perspective and the players are unbelieveable. Every quote from Eddie House is hilarious. Last season was amazing because so many people expected this team to fold but seeing the run from the inside perspective makes it a special read.
3265	Bread Slicer: I use the bread slicer everyday. You have to be careful with it. I broke one of the plastic guides very easily. Wish they had a sturdier model.
3266	Personal preference: I think coffee taste is more of a personal preference, but I was not fond of this decaf coffee. I always drink my coffee black and I didn't get the rich coffee taste that I like with the Don Francisco brand. Illy has a great reputation so I am guessing their non-decaf coffee is outstanding, they just need a little work with the decaf.
3267	Cheap buckles: I bought this because they looked heavy duty. I spiked about 10 square feet of my yard and the buckles became loose. When I went to tighten, the buckle snapped (very cheap plastic). I did not pay much for these so I guess I can't complain much, you get what you pay for, but I would have hoped they lasted longer than 10 square feet. I was going to buy new metal buckles, but the nylon straps (heavy duty) are sewn & glued around the buckle. If it wasn't for the crappy buckles, I would say good buy for the money. Otherwise they aren't worth it.
3268	Very Good Music!!!!: If you are a jazz fan,this is an excellant recording for you.At midnight,and News from the blue's are very good,as is the rest of this recording.One of my favorites!
3269	Humanistic Sci Fi: Thought this book was more than great, very mind expanding.The title Speaker for the Dead makes it sound like a horror story or something morbid, which is misleading. The lead character Ender was a child general who lead an intersteller army in the distruction of another species which he didn't know because he believed he was just doing battle simulations at the training academy. Afterward he calls himself the speaker for the dead - the dead being that lost species. When a new intelligent species, the "piggies" are discovered he finds the opportunity to redeem his past. The books moves along alittle slow at times, action wise(Ender's Game the prequil is more fast paced an action packed), but this book is deep.
3270	DISAPPOINTED: poor quality and did not fit my chair - it was too short. Cost too much to return and kept it so I could show everyone what I got and how it looked. and told them not to buy from this company. Love amazon just not this particular company product. Their magazine looks fantastic but will not order from them because of this one product.
3271	:-): Own it, Love it!Great value for price.If you are not an electronics buff, get it, my only concern is that it does not take certain AV inputs that makes porting a laptop signal to it easy.-Richie Etwaru
3272	Good Mixer: I bought this mixer to use it with my Pyle-Pro PPHP1588A speakers. Liked the low, mid and high equalizer functions. If you need a mixer i recommend this to anyone with a budget.
3273	One of my favorites: This movie is funny and endearing. I think the supporting characters are stronger than the main actor--don't let that deter you. The men are loving and real; I bought this movie after having seen it on video and am very pleased with my purchase.
3274	Robert Plant Now & Zen: I happen to be a huge Robert Plant fan so I may be a little biased when I say that I loved this cd. My favorite songs on this cd are "Cool White Sheets", "Tall Cool One" and "Ship of Fools". Roberts voice is as good as the first day he grabbed a microphone! He's just Robert "the Almighty" Plant and there is no better.
3275	good album: I recommend this album. Quite a few time, and tempo changes throughout. 4/4 with tempo change between chorus and pre-chorus, 6/8 middle part w/ solo, and 15/8! on the Longest day. 7/8 main riff on Brighter than One Thousand suns. Lots of ideas input by the entire band makes this one shine. This is an interesting, solid album!
3276	Wonderful Audio Book Experience: Scarlett Feather is a well written, albeit predictable, Irish family saga that is especially enjoyable as an audiobook. The narrator did a splendid job of capturing the many, many different voices of the characters and their personalities. In fact, the high quality of the narrator's voice really kept my interest even when I already knew how the book was going to end.The story will appeal to fans of Ms. Binchy and/or Irish fiction. There is humor, tragedy, love, and insight into contemporary Irish culture. And the audiobook version makes a wonderful companion on a road trip.Cheers!
3277	Fine for talk, tinny sounding for music: I use these mostly to listen to podcasts, so they work great for that. But if you are an audiophile, you will be as sorely dissapointed as I was in the sound. Very tinny and poor bass response. I have a pair of Advent wireless speakers that sound MUCH better with music; however, I haven't tried them with my computer as the transmitter accepts only analog input. The Audio Unlimited speakers were easy to set up with the computer and worked right out of the box. And yes, the remote won't work after ten minutes even if the units are on AC power. Dumb design if you are putting them out of reach. If they had named them Audio Limited, that would have been more accurate.
3278	Fantastic: This game is fun, LOADED with questions (5 discs)and highlyentertaining. I played using only one of the five discs for severalhours with friends and (unlike that "Who wants to be aMillionaire") have yet to see a repeat question. Not for kids under 17.Press the Escape key to pause game.
3279	Read this book, before you make your first movie!: The is a must read for the first time filmmaker! Having read the section "The 10 minute film school" in Robert's book, prepared me more than most of my film classes ever did. That short chapter alone put me light years ahead of other students. Learing to make films can be a hard, but with Robert's book it really can be very simple.
3280	The Abandoned: This is probably the best of the bunch for Horrorfest '06, but in reality it's nothing spectacular, so that makes the Horrorfest pretty lackluster if you think about it. The atmosphere in this movie is top notch, and the location is amazingly cool. I was bored by this movie on more than one occasion, but even then I still managed to enjoy it quite a bit. It just had so much original stuff going on and just so much going for it. The direction and script could have been tighter, but the atmosphere trumps all and this is one very unique ghost story.
3281	Enjoyable, but not his best: I basically agree with mark21765. It's a great album with excellent playing from everyone, but it's not very adventurous. Indeed, it sounds a bit like Miles' quintet. It's Frisell's guitar playing that makes it a bit unique. I love Frisell. I somehow like Douglas' more daring and interesting projects. I love Uri Caine, too, but his own projects are much more fun and exciting. I can't say anything bad about this album, it's excellent, but I was expecting a little more creativity from Douglas.
3282	Be Very Careful: Yes, this book contains some worthwhile information. The problem is knowing what is worthwhile and what is questionable. While he raises good points about fiber consumption, he ends the chapter with advice about colon cleansing, along with an invitation to "call my office" for more information, something which appears in the book several times. There are also endorsements for a certain kind of water purification system. His biography lists degrees in "science" (?), business administration, biology, chemistry, psychology, and exercise physiology. He's also a "licensed nutritionist". OK, what's missing? The names of the universities that granted all of these degrees.
3283	ok book very short infomation could be better: I got this book thinking it would go deeper into the world of insects and how they can survive with their defenses but each of the 90+ chapters only covers just a little bit of what each insect can do and gives a brief example. The info is great but very limited and I was dispointed this book is not worth the $30.00 i paid.
3284	BEWARE!: i rented this movie and while the movie is probably pretty good, Miramax completely ruined it by DUBBING it and not offering an original Chinese track w/ Eng subtitles. Skip this and pick up an IMPORT version on EBay.
3285	Oh my god sooooo bad!: One star is truely an overrating. This movie isnt worth the price of a rental, spend your money on candy you'll enjoy it more! My question is how did this movie ever get made and why, why, why...
3286	Battery worked about 2 times. Then died.: I purchased a battery for my camcorder. It only lasted for about two charges.
3287	One of many McNaught greats!: Almost Heaven was my first of McNaughts. Since then, I've HAD to read her others, because I enjoy her writing so much, and the characters are inter-twined. I highly recommend Judith Mcnaughts work, If you're new to her, start with "Whitney My Love".Then read "Something Wonderful", Then Once and Always. This will assure your aquaintance with the characters in the rest of them (that contain the Westmorelands, Thorton, Duville,etc.) And will be to your fullest enjoyment
3288	happy dogs!: I have been giving Wellness treats to my dogs for awhile. They really like them and I think Wellness puts out a good product. When I get the box out at night, they run to their crates and wait for their late night snack. No command necessary!
3289	poor listing: This listing is unlikely to sell many traps, since it does not show the size of the trap or the species of animal it is intended to catch!
3290	one cold bland nutcracker: Fast tempos at times, bland interpretation,no emotion or magic for that matter this is what you need in this work of Tchaikovsky and you dont get it here from dorati,the amsterdam players play well still dorati ruins it.Get his sleeping beauty with this same orchestra its better, but if you want a great performence of the nutcracker get ernest ansermets 1959 (decca),charles dutiots complete version with the montreal symphony (decca),or eugene ormandys 1960 (columbia) version there a lot better.
3291	Can Disposer Tote: Was disappointed that the dispenser/tote did not dispense the 12 oz. soft drink cans. The cans fit too tightly against the sides and would not move or rotate toward the opening. Have to manually push each can to get it out of the dispenser/tote.Purchased four.Would not purchase any more.
3292	Real Life is better than Fiction: I loved the movie Argo, but a few things didn't ring true. And sure enough, they weren't, as revealed in this book. But the book itself is fascinating. Amazing stories. Why read fictional spy tales when the real thing is available? A real "can't put it down book."
3293	What's The Point?: European, Asian, and Australian films have really made an impact on me over the last few months. After seeing "I Stand Alone", "Irreversible", "Eden Lake" (and several other Dimension Extreme titles), and of course "Rec" -I truly have become jaded towards American horror. "Quarantine" is exemplary. This film tries to virtually copy "Rec" scene for scene with lower grade scares and FX. Unless your're a completist just skip it and watch "Rec". Even those who hate subtitles will be glad they did. What's with this trend anyway? Even Michael Haneke remade "Funny Games", his own film, for crissakes. This unneeded remake cycle seemed to occur about the time Gus Van Sant made his biggest mistake in tackling "Psycho" which I think everyone agrees was a waste of celluloid. As much as films cost to make nowadays one would think there would be better things to "Rec".
3294	Big hit at our house: I just bought this when my son was 7 months old and I wasn't sure if he could do it on his own or not. Well as soon as I put it together I put him on and he not only stayed on by himself but started scooting across the kitchen.There are enough gadgets on this to keep him busy even when he's not riding, and he loves the trunk in the front that we hide toys in. This is definitely a big hit.I haven't used it as a walking support yet but it's really easy to switch back and forth between the two. I'd definitely recommend this toy. Might want to get it even when you think your child is too young for it because you'd be surprised how much they can do before you think they're ready.
3295	WEW Lost: In one word this is a lousy DVD. It is the worst of the genre. It is also too short but it is better that way. too bad i cannot get a refund. Also Christina Ricci (film Actress) is not in this title. Shoddy advertising.
3296	ghost characters: Salter's poetic prose at times reads too precious. Characters come and go, are left behind- vanish, in a picaresque of loss and despair. What kept me reading was Salter's evocative description of place. He has the ability to distill the essence of geography with the skill of a cartographer while holding fast to the invisible details that bring a terrain to life. Perhaps I am faulting Salter for the book he in fact aimed to write. Light Years is about what the poet John Ashberry calls "time's silent roar" and its indifference to all within earshot of its muted din. Salter's vaporous characters inhabit a ghost-like nether world intimating with each jaded aside: "We are here only for so long, and there's not a damn thing we can do about it." They remain on the page, never jumping full to life- obscure, shadowed, and with the pall of death lingering over them like a coming storm.
3297	Amazing Book!!!: Anyone out there considering cosmetic surgery has to check this helpful book out! I used it in my own search in deciding if plastic surgery was the right choice for me...and it was! I especially loved the chapter on cosmetic dentistry. Thank you Troi Martin for this amazing and helpful guide that acompanied me into my own appointments!
3298	Awesome!: These peoples reviews where great and me and my mom are thinking about geting one.This is a great toy!
3299	Crap: It broke the first day. The mechanism doesn't work anymore... also noticed the bad quality of the plastic around the button and the button itself looks suspitious... Also too small.Stay away.
3300	Nice but.....: Really good quality. Looks great on my fridge.Only problem I have with it is I wish it was totally open. It closes off a little on one side that is designated specifically for the pencil. I bought it to keep bills handy and in plain sight and have no use for the pad and pencil.Bills still fit in it but you have to squish them a little.Definitely worth the price!
3301	Slam!: This is a good book about an urban kid trying to get a good career in basketball, but he has problems on the way. He is the star player at his high school but runs into some problems like his friends, drugs, girls, and school. He gets transferred to another school and is trying to fit in there while trying to keep up in his school work and his basketball career. I like this book because it shows how to take care or situations and keeps you wondering how he's going to fix his problems. I recommend this book to sports fans, teenagers, and some children.
3302	"Around the world in a few dollers": This video is a "Must Watch" collection for all those who are passionate to see all the great sites on this beautiful planet EARTH.
3303	WOW: I thought this would be so much better. Don't watch the ads because that is not what the game is like. There are far to many load screens that take an eternity. People have said this is like gears of war. It is not even close!!!!!!! It steals ideas from there and them makes them bad. Terrible interface and many glitches!! What is the deal with the melee attacks. It is the same button as shoot so you never know what it is going to do.This is fun if you have someone to play with. Other wise forget it, this is a waste of money and an insult to the name Gears of War. They tried far to hard to add cool little things like congratulating your partner, and videos with awesome graphics.Story is very bad does not flow at all and very abrupt ending. You can hardly even tell that you are fighting the last guy until he is dead.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3304	not bad: would have been better if they would have shown the creatures alittle better, but was a good movie would watch again
3305	Great textbook: I'm not that good at any science. This textbook was written and put together in such a way that I was able to preform very highly in my class.
3306	More Mike Hammer: The second set of the classic Mike Hammer stories. The books have been around for a while but seem to be maiking a comeback. The books are in the hard boiled PI genre, with significant violence but very little sexual content. This is macho man type writing. Mike Hammer is a hardfisted type who smokes, drinks, and has few second thoughts about blowing a hole in someone with a 45. They tend to be well written, quick reading type novels as Hammer becomes involved in various cases. On the side there is his beautiful assistant/girl Friday Velda. Mickey spillane's novels place women in subservient roles, i.e., they are not oriented to being politically correct.
3307	More Gunsmoke action: Joseph A. West takes you back to Dodge city with vividly drawn characters, fierce action and all the fine citizens of Dodge.I can't wait for the next exciting tale in the series!
3308	Great Little Shoe: This is a wonderful "Driving Moc", super flexibility and great fit. Has become my favorite shoe when I'm not in uniform! If they had more colors I'd own everyone! Enjoy, enjoy!
3309	The outstanding summary of the K-T controversy: James Powell has managed to create a simple but enthralling summary of paleontology's must engrossing subject. Although the viewpoint is slightly biased it explains the stubborn and flawed opposing arguement aswell as the modern and most widely accepted view of the K-T Extinction event while retaining a level headed perspective that the debate will probably never end. I found this book to be absolutely inspiring as i'm sure everyone else in the paleo community did and now even the hardened veterans must see that the evidence is no coincidence or "bad science".
3310	Very Helpful: I got this book as a resource for a paper I was writing about Bill Heirens. Very accurate information stated clearly and in an organized way. I've gotten some true crime books before and they sound like one big rant and are very annoying to read with very unreliable information. I recommend this one to anybody!
3311	Appalachain Home Cooking: I have not been able to read the entire book yet, but what I have read is very interesting. Some of the foods I have never heard of or seen. The food that the mountaineers have prepared seem very comforting. Will review more when I finish the book.
3312	Pleasantly suprised: I read many reviews about this brush prior to purchasing. I have spent tons of money on other brushes that just ended up pulling my hair out after 6 months of use. I am so glad I purchased this. I bought one for me and my daughter and she loves it as well!
3313	Not Satisfied!!: I received this item damaged, assuming due to shipping. Since there were two openings to put in your pet, I taped the broken end. This part held up. The "good" opening fell off after about 10 minutes of running and my pet escaped!! On the upside, Amazon has a great return policy.
3314	This was a horrible book: Honestly, I don't know what story the other reviewers read but the book I picked up had some of the worst stories I've ever read. That's including "See Spot. See Spot run. Run, Spot run." The Morning After was the only story worth anything and really I'm just picking the lesser of all the evils. Don't invest in this book. Raunchiness does not make up for a horrible storyline. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
3315	An Academic Novel for Romantic Post-Structuralists: I sat down to read _Hallucinating Foucault_ one sleepy evening and became to engrossed I could not stop reading until I finished a couple energizing hours later. Duncker makes my brain work. She brilliantly brings forth the human side of late twentieth century post-structural philosophy and post-modern literature, binding the reader into a love triangle that's both solid and ethereal. What does the reader bring to the text? What sort of relationship does the reader have with the writer? What happens if the reader really does go to seek the author--who isn't dead after all--and blends his intellectual dream with "reality"? As a doctoral student, my favorite thing about this book is that the plot has the best possible happy ending--the protag. finishes his diss. and gets a job!! This is better than Byatt's _Possession_ and up there with Winterson's _The Passion_ for me.
3316	The Body in the Bookcase: I'm about half-way through this book and I am very disappointed. First of all the title is misleading. The body is not in the bookcase, only the head is, sort of. The head is on the bottom shelf with the body on its side tied to a chair. There also is a lot of unnecessary information and people in the book. The characters are two dimensional and I got no feeling of suspense, thrill, or am I even interested in "who-done-it". I don't think it's a "who-done-it" plot.I'm left to wonder if The Body in the Fjord is really in the Fjord or just has a hand trailing in the frigid water. Try, try again, but read some more mysteries, do, Ms. Katherine Hall Page. p.s. the british authors are the best!
3317	Disappointed: I was very disappointed. I was going to show my girlfriend, but it had porn after the lesson. In fact, there was more porn than there was instruction.
3318	It went on & on & on & on & on & on & on & on: This book was very boring for me. The testimonies from the subjects in question seemed to be just wishful thinking on their part.
3319	Please God, let this be the end!!!: All I can say is that the final Rama book was worse than the other two sequals to "Rendezvous...". This extremely long dime-novel was not worth my time and money. I was already upset that A.C. Clarke would waste his energy and paper on the two previous novels in this series, but this book brings me to new levels of disappointment. If you are interested in slutty sex scenes and stupid action-adventure, and do not want to find any meaning in a book then read this one. For anyone who is not a horny twelve-year old, I suggest passing this one by.
3320	A useless "introduction" to AD&D: While on the cover this set proclaims to be a sort of use-all, when you open it you recognize it to be a poor introductory game for those who haven't started their venture into real AD&D. Otherwise it is barely useful as a creation engine for dull dungeons. The monster cards are only the basicmost ones from the Monstrous Manual, without the imprtant stats at that, the Magic Items cards have more gold than magical items, and those that are there are unusable in AD&D. And, of course, the dungeon design cards are only marginally useful for creating one color dungeons where all rooms are all the same.
3321	Totally Disappointed: I upgraded from viruscan pro 7 to this and it was nothing but headaches for me. I did clean installs several times as per technical support but privacy service and spam killer would slow my system to a crawl then I'd watch my cpu temps climb as it just sat there and got slower and slower. I can't reccomend this product.. and I was always a big fan of Mcafee. looks like I'm going back to my old version until they get some issues resolved. The forums on their site are bubbling with complaints
3322	Strong unit, performs well. Supplied wiring is okay: Firstly, the wiring that came with this kit was okay. Was a little short for me and I was only running from my bumper to the firewall. That being said, It had everything I needed. In my mind, the switch they supply is worthless and the LED is too bright at night (almost blinding).The lights themselves are very strong and the metal is of high quality. Easy to assemble/disassemble for replacement and mounting. Rock guards are of a soft, but rigid plastic that holds up in extreme temperatures. No fading for scratching.
3323	Blew-em out with Classic Punk: These were fine for a short while. When cranked with Dead Boys, Johnny Thunders, Floyd or whatever they frazzeled and are now in the garbage can.
3324	Great Book: I really enjoyed reading this work, for it reminded me of many things that I experienced in my childhood. Dowler combined wit with wisdom in each short story, making it enjoyable to read to the entire family. I recommend it, four and 1/2 stars.
3325	Its not a slip cover!: Its a throw. like a blanket. I would have been better off with a pretty curtain to think of it. It would be better than what I wasted my money on. Also don't wash this with anything else,Even like colors, as the Dye leaks badly.+++++++++++++++ update +++++++++++++++++++++++A year after buying this, Amazon finally corrected this to say throw instead of slipcover. Late much?
3326	Backlight not so good, but servicable: My need was for an alarm clock that would wake me to NOAA weather. This does that. The display is bright, as shown only for a few seconds after pressing a button. After that, it is very dim. It is readable, don't get me wrong... I'm keeping it. The alert feature, I'm just leaving that off, but playing with it, it seemed a little problematic. If I were concerned about alerts, I would get something with SAME technology.
3327	Price Double Supermarket's: Smuckers Apricot Preserves is a good product. My objection is this vendor's pricing per unit.It is more than double supermarket price per unit of $3.99.
3328	Great little pan: Have been using it for almost 2 months and eggs still slide out like it was brand new! I also bought the 12 inch pan on reccommendation from America's Test Kitchen-They were spot on as usual
3329	Rusted, doubt it's all stainless steel: Rusted at spout and inside, soap was coming out green. I don't think it's really stainless steel. Smelled awful the first time I had to replace the soap.
3330	Rather better than some, but not well: This movie has all the ingredients for a truly beautiful movie, but they just never mix. I'm quite a fan of the "Ghostly/Eternal love" theme, but this movie just can't compare with the great movies of that genre such as Always, A guy named joe and the best of them all, Gene Tierney, and Rex Harrison's The Ghost an Mrs. Muir (1947)
3331	A waste of time and your money: This book is really an insult to those who has a brain. What can I say? I definitely would not buy into the author's the other hype: the "D.V. Code".The plot in this story is so dull and plain, you almost predict it from the beginning: when Susan Fletcher (the main character) over and over agin mentioned at the beginning that there are no "unbreakable code", you almost immediately suspect whatever is running in that TRANSLTR machine is just a decoy for "unbreakable code", and the true purpose was to implant virus. GUESS WHAT? THAT WAS THE WHOLE PLOT of the book! How disappointed it is!Also, the love story and David Becker's journey in Spain to successfully retrieve the ring was so irrelevant to the plot and so dull, you have to be a real idiot to believe it is remotely possible.Needless to say, as other reviewers pointed out, the mistakes author made regarding computer technology are too many.Save your time and money!
3332	JUNK: I would NEVER recommend this item to anyone. I have had it for approximately 2 months and it no longer works. JUNK JUNK JUNK!
3333	Amy Grant steps in to pop songs with a "Heart in motion": One of the top albums of 1991 Heart in Motion is Amy Grant's best album in the world of Amy Grant. From the rocking Good for me to the dance pop hit Baby Baby which is written about her new baby Millie and where the album gets it's title to the wonderful Gailileo. Then there is the power rocker You're not alone which could have been a single. If you liked the Eurythimics hit Here comes the rain again you will love You're not alone. There is also the fun Hats which is about a very busy girl and also the touching I will remember you that sounds like it could've been used in a movie. The last two ballads how can we see that far and hope set high are just plain wonderful endings to the album. Get this wonderful album from the first lady of Christian pop and see for yourself you will not be disapointed.A job well done for such a wonderful album Miss Grant,Regis
3334	Where's the real Sweet Valley?: I'm going to be totally honest here: the book was very good, and I'd recommend it to any SVU fan, but otherwise I'm really unhappy with the turn that the series has taken lately. I understand that Francine has to keep the reality going, but in all honesty I miss Nick, Izzy, Danny, Winston, and the way that things used to be for the twins. Call me sentimental, but it's just the way I am. The Elizabeth series might be exciting, especially with Max, Vanessa, Alice, and Sarah Pennington there to spruce it up, but it's still not Sweet Valley. And what bugs me is that we are not going to get to hear about Jess or the other characters at this rate, either. Does anyone feel this way? Please write me a message and let me know if you agree!
3335	one of the best books i read this year: I took this book out from my library - started reading it - and soon realized that I needed my own copy, since there were so many passages I wanted to highlight and underline. You can pick this up to any chapter and learn something. It is so jammed packed with helpful and insightful ideas that there is almost TOO MUCH info to absorb! Really probably one of the best books i've read this year. If you're in business for yourself, looking to expand your horizons or looking for some self-help - this book has it all!
3336	Excellent quality.: I thought I was ordering the same photo paper as I've been using, also HP Premium, but this is an even better quality & the photos are clear & the color very good. It's a thicker paper, and is exactly what I wanted. Great product.A W
3337	one tree hill: i think its a really good book for fans but im not a really good fan so i dint really get it but its good writing n a good book. but i dint get it since im not a fan
3338	Cheap... Bad welds...: It works to raise your handlebars but it looks like it cost about a dollar to make! The welds look like they were done in a high school metal shop. It could be really nice if the welds were smooth and the chrome was heavier. I would be willing to pay more for a better product. However, there isn't a lot of 21.1 options available so the choices are limited.
3339	Rich Dad has rich lessons: I thought this book had great lessons for those of us who don't properly understand money. I wish I had read this when I was 21, but better late than never. I felt it had so many good lessons about understanding money, and how to put money to work for you, that I bought a copy for each of my four kids for Christmas. I am hoping we can all think about money differently, after reading this book, and begin to create the wealth and comfort in our lives that we all deserve!
3340	Bad: Look, I know they're not exactly new, but this was the kind of phone my dad wanted. He loved his old razr so I bought this one for him. It was crap, and it stopped working two weeks after I got it.
3341	10-year old son won't read because of foul language, BEWARE!: I'm really disappointed that this book is recommended for ages 12 and up, yet contains many instances of the F-word. I bought this book based upon it's historical significance and my son was looking forward to reading it. I am extremely careful in the literature I offer him and wish there had been a warning as to the content of this book. Thankfully, upon encountering the foul language, my son refused to read any more. Very disappointed.
3342	Comfy but straps are VERY HARD to adjust: I bought this car seat for our 2 month old as she HATED the Graco SnugRide and we needed something more comfortable for her to ride in. This seat worked wonders. She loved it. It is very comfy and roomy. However, the straps are impossible to adjust rear facing. I had to remove the seat from the car just to loosen them. What a Pain!!!!!!!!!! Now that my daughter is 15 months, I am not that impressed with the straps as they have one height adjustment for forward facing and it seems too high and rubs against her neck. I bought this seat because it is highly rated. However, I would buy the Britax seat over this one again as we bought the Marathon for my two year. It is extremely easy to use and not that much hassle.
3343	What is the fuss about??: "The Historian" (aka "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Eastern Europe...But Were Afraid to Ask") is a plodding dull read. I got through 2/3 of it and gave up as I realized I couldn't care less what happens to the characters in the book. Kostova is a poor Caleb Carr wannabee.
3344	good for star wars fans: This game was very good if you love Star Wars. However the controls were a little difficult to learn at the begining but becomes easier with game play. Something I found is that the game ran much better after I got the expansion pack.
3345	These Sheets Feel Horrible: I returned these immediately. They feel terrible for sheets that are somwhat expensive. I see a lot of positive reviews, but I cannot believe that anyone would want to sleep on these sheets - they are rough and feel like cheap polyester sheets. There is no way they are of the quality that Amazon describes them to be. There are many less expensive sheets that will feel much better than these.
3346	Super Creepy: This book is super creepy and weird. The mother sneaks into her adult son's bead and cradles him in her arms? Yeah that is bizarre. Then she dies. What a wonderful children's book. I won't be reading this to my son again.
3347	WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES: Torn between two lovers. That's the problem our intrepid fresh-feeling heroine faces. First is Arch Hall Jr., the spam colored boyfriend who endlessly sings about other women. Then there is Richard Keil without the metal teeth who has a penchant for eating shave cream. How can a girl decide? Her father is no help as he encourages Eegah to paw and maul her. But Eegah is a sensitive caveman, always remembering to carry Roxy's purse.
3348	The Bigs is both HARD and FUN: Here's the deal:The Bigs can be very frustrating at first. Most of this frustration is caused by the manual being horrible at descirbing the required motions with the wiimote.However, once you figure out the controls, the game becomes quite fun. If anything, all you need is good coordination and a good memory to have fun (there are ALOT of different wiimote actions).After you get over the controls (it took me a day or two), you can concentrate on enjoying the game. Slow-motion leaps and dives, 30 foot superman-esque jumps off the wall to steal homers, etc. I've read complaints about the swing being delayed a bit compared to wii sports baseball. My answer? Deal with it! Anyone half good at video games will get used to it almost immediately. Some people just like to complain :).I've only had this game for a few days, and look forward to building up my rookie. So far I'm quite satisfied with my purchase.
3349	They changed the words!: The same thing with this one too! I tried with many CDs ... You just can't find the original anymore ... Well, atleast right now! Some smart person will come out with the original again ... But now is not the time. Don't buy it unless you like it "DRY". Its not a good felling, getting stiffed, then no refund!
3350	A MUST READ!!!: This is a wonderful story that makes us realize that the time we have with our loved ones is not as long as we would like. It is great to stir up memories of loved ones passed and it is also good to help you acknowledge the little things you may be missing in your day to day life with your family.
3351	Classic: They just keep getting better. Things never go as planned but always work out in the end. British humor at it's best. Rowan Atkinson is a great smarmy weasel. Hugh Laury is hilarious as the daft prince. Get'em all.
3352	Time to end it: It wasn't a bad movie. It just wasn't near as good as the previous two. I didn't really care about any of the characters. The death scenes were actually kind of funny. But they also weren't all that imaginative either. I love the first two films because the ways people died was just so cool. In this one they find new ways to smash people's heads.
3353	Mawkish: The best that can be said about this book is that it offers wonderful thumbnail sketches of the great early expeditions to the Pole....Shackleton, Scott, Amundsen. As for the rest, well, that is best left unsaid. Suffice it to say that Kim Stanley Robinson could use an editor with a honed scalpel.
3354	Pinzon Sheet Set: Product is generally good, however the texture is not as soft as I would expect for a high thread count sheet. Also, rgardless of washer & dryer settings the sheets come out very wrinkled. Over-all I would give this product a grade of "C."
3355	Short of it's Goal: While this book makes some strong statements against Chirstainity being a foolproof religion. It does not touch at all on other religions like Islam, Buddism, or Hinduism. When in a debate you must have as much information on your subject as possible, and this book is well short of that goal.
3356	look elsewhere: There are wonderful miniseries out there. Either of the Forsyth Sagas, Wives and Daughters, Berkley Square and all of the Upstairs Downstairs series. Even Catherine Cookson's The Girl or Glass Virgin is better. This is not one of those. This is heavy going with unlikeable people and often absurd situations. Call me a fool but someone, somewhere should end up happy in these stories.
3357	Worked Great on Days 1 and 2, inside snapped on Day3: This was awesome when camping with ~12 adults and worked like a dream (used coffee filters to keep grounds out of coffee).Unfortunately my internal percolator was made with very soft aluminum so it bent easily and cracked. this caused the water to not be able to go up the straw.
3358	If you think Ann Coulter has an honest bone in her body...: ... try reading Al Franken's "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right." Franken thoroughly examines the journalistic "integrity" of the 41 (or is it 39???) year old Ms. Coulter and finds it thoroughly wanting.
3359	Poor translation: Anna Karenina itself is a terrific book. When you're reading a Russian book in English, though, the translation is everything, and this translation is not the best. Not only does the translation change the meaning in spots, but words and even entire sentences have been completely left out of the book. At times, the story does not seem to make sense - then I switch to another translation I have (Pevear/Volokhonsky), and voila, there is a missing sentence or paragraph that clears everything up.
3360	Great for removing glued-on labels from products: I used to use carbon tet. to remove labels stuc on products, but that is no longer available. So I use nail polish remover. It works pretty good; I soak the label in the liquid and use either my finger nail or a spatula to scrape off the soaked label.
3361	Decent attempt....but with a major problem.: Focusing primarily on the rarely-seen Fleischer/Famous Superman shorts from World War II (which, like most of the war cartoons produced under the Paramount banner, features the Japanese), this disc has about the best video possible for a public domain release of these classic cartoons. Problem is, this company has arrogantly decided to add their own sound effects in addition to (and sometimes over) the original soundtrack. What could be a reasonably affordable holdover until Warner Bros. restores the cartoons turns into a colossal waste because of the audio equivalent of graffiti. Additionally, the beginning of the final cartoon, "Terror on the Midway" is nothing more than a series of freeze frames, implying that the publisher didn't look too hard for a decent print. Definitely not worth buying.
3362	Did not work for long: We ordered this filter as a direct replacement to the one the fridge came with. Everything was running fine until last week when water just quit coming out of the dispenser at all.If you do any research on my particular fridge you will find that the icemaker, which is making next to nothing of ice for the last 2 months or so (making ice real slow), and the water dispenser are a major issue. This is concerning the ice maker itself and the multi-control board that runs the dispenser.I rip the filter out today only to find that it is totally blocking all water from getting through. My water has not changed since the last filter nor is the water coming out now rough and ugly with the plug installed.Sad that this filter only lasted less than 5 months, their quality must be getting bad or I got a shabby one.
3363	Far from the Madding Crowd: I have enjoyed the classics so much since purchasing my Kindle. This was one of my favorites. It is a great story with lots of interesting characters. My attention was held from beginning to end.Far From the Madding Crowd
3364	Dim transfer, lousy DVD: Lovely Soviet animated film from 1957, marred by a badly faded, scratched, and spliced print. The English language track, featuring Tommy Kirk and Sandra Dee, dates from the film's 1959 US release -- as does the live-action prologue with Art Linkletter. No Russian-language soundtrack here, folks. The video transfer is so dim and grainy that night scenes are all but unwatchable. For such a steep retail price, this DVD is an insult. An average dollar-bin disc looks better.
3365	DON'T DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY !: PRODUCT WAS DEFECTIVE, CANNOT GET IT REPLACED NOR A REFUND.DON'T DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE
3366	A Must Read!: In the last few years I have read many spiritual books, and this is now one of my favorites.The author draws on the readings of Edgar Cayce, as well as the views of several others, to discuss the realms that await us after death. A great asset of this book is that it shows how our thoughts and beliefs will actually impact the realm we find ourselves in upon death. For instance, although God does not damn anyone to a hellish afterlife, if someone believes that that is what they will find, they will. However, no one is stuck in a "negative" realm forever - there is always help available to those who are ready to give up their "earth-bound" thoughts.The author also discusses the importance of prayer and meditation in preparing our souls for the afterlife, and he has included several exercises to help readers with the process.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in spirituality, the after-life, &/or Edgar Cayce's readings.
3367	Absolutely, positively outstanding!: As you read the narrative that is imaginatively layed out with different type and size mixed in with graphics and photos you can almost hear Michael Jordan speaking. They are his words and reveal some things about his life that I've never read before...and I've read everything written about him. As you can see I am a big fan and miss him so much on the basketball court. This book is just one of the many reasons that I along with millions of other people am a big fan of his. The book is as brilliant and polished as he is and also has the same good taste he has. Another great thing about "For the Love of the Game" is it will appeal to almost anyone of any age You can skim thru and look at the photos or read the stats or read every word. Whichever way you choose you will enjoy this book.
3368	Simply Awful: The box cover and desription of this make this flick seem sexy and edgy. It is actually boring, depressing, and almost completely reprehensible. The moral of the story is that straight men can be persuaded to pity gay men enough to sleep with them (but only if they have AIDS and are dying). I was insulted by this film. Save yourself time and agravation--skip this one!
3369	Basic Equine Genetics Primer: I don't share the opninion of some of the other reviews out there for this book. While ALL informational books become somewhat "dated" after a couple of decades, that doesn't mean they are "worthless" - as a matter of fact, as new information comes out, some of the old, very good, information gets LEFT OUT of the "new" books. This is a good basic primer for equine genetics. Just because some items have changed over time doesn't mean that the basic info isn't good. It's handy to have around to look up something on the "quick".
3370	Great old band: I saw GMM play in 1991 when they supported Debbie Harry on a UK tour. They were great then - Shirley Manson was cool even before she got famous. I've got this and another album, Fish Heads and Tails, which is just as good. Good strong tunes. Still looking for a copy of the Live album they apparently released.......
3371	great recording, then, now, and always: I don't remember the ,70s; I wasn't even alive then. Gram Parsons was dead before I was born, but, thanks to this recording, I've had the opportunity to listen to the golden voice that is still vibrant with life. This is an outstanding country-rock recording, and it's great to have (it bears repeated listenings very well). I would have never have stumbled on it, but my uncle, knowing my musical tastes (which include Dwight Yoakam, Lucinda Williams, and Bob Dylan), guessed that I would like it, and he was right. Now, I'm guessing that if you like great music, you'll love this album too. Buy it today, and help keep the tradition alive!
3372	Lots of fun!!: This is my 16 month old's favorite book. MY husband and I get tired of making all the dog sounds, but he doesn't! A cute book!
3373	A Legendary Rock Album: This is, along with Van Halen's first album, probably the best debut album of all-time. I recommend this 100%. But it's not just "Welcome to the Jungle," "Sweet Child 'O Mine," and "Paradise City" that make this a 15x platinum album. It's the supporting cast, such as "It's So Easy," "Nightrain," "Mr. Brownstone," "My Michelle," and "Rocket Queen." I really can't pick out one bad song here; they're all hardcore, super-charged songs. This covers everything that a hardcore rock album needs: dancing with Mr. Brownstone, telling of a girl w/ a dad in porno and a mom that was a heroine-addict, etc. Lastly, I really stress the fact that Slash is the most underrated guitarist around. Take one listen to this album and you'll hear some nasty riffs and crazy noises coming from his ax. This is the ultimate album, no question!
3374	NAVIGON PIECE OF JUNK: DON'T BUY THIS C**P. IT'S THE WORST GPS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO CHECK GOOGLE MAPS BEFORE I LEAVE MY HOUSE, BECAUSE THIS JUNK IS TAKING ME CIRCLES, THROUGH SHOPPING CENTERS. IT'S THE MOST FRUSTRATING WOORTHLESS DEVICE EVER. AND NOW YOU CAN'T EVEN REACH CUSTOMER SERVICE.
3375	Poor sound quality: I had to replace a GE unit which developed what appears to be a common problem of cutting off incoming messages without any warning---although it did have great sound quality. I decided to try this AT&T machine, in spite of the reviews which mentioned poor sound quality. Those reviews were right. The sound quality on incoming messages is sometimes so poor as to make the unit worthless. I am now trying a Radio Shack unit. Don't waste your money on this AT&T machine.
3376	WORST comedy I have seen to date, and I've seen a LOT of em.: This movie was EXTREMELY bad. The physical comedy and ingenious parodies that made movies like Naked Gun, Airplane, and Dracula: Dead and Loving It were ill-concieved, mostly recycled, and sometimes out-and-out bad. I cannot believe that Leslie Nielsen even DID this movie. Without his comedic talents, this movie could have actually been one of the worst EVER for ANY movie, rivaling Plan Nine from Outer Space.
3377	A book for everyone: If you're mormon, post mormon, motorcycle enthusiast, westerner, feminist, post feminist, or a reader who just likes a good story, then you'll enjoy this book.Richman writes truthfully about her experience as a new Mormon pioneer - paving her way out of rather than into the Mormon Church. She parallels her solo motorcycle trip from Nauvoo, IL to Salt Lake during the fall of 2001 with the faithful (and fateful) journey her decedents who traveled the Mormon Trail 150 years earlier.The motorcycle metaphors may tire some, but I thought they added to the story. On the whole it is a good story. I felt a connection to her sense of pride in the pioneering spirit of her family side-by-side with her inability to live with such unquestioning faith.
3378	Use with caution: I was disappointed to find a number of errors in this book. When I cross-referenced some answers provided with text books and laws, they were not all correct. It was useful to have various subjects in one book to know what to study, but otherwise I would not use it for the actual material presented. I also found that it was not well organized. It seems some others found it to be great, but I scored well on the exam by studying notes, text books, and laws.
3379	Great quality and perfect for every day carry.: First off I am left handed and this is not set up for a lefty but do no let that stop you from purchasing. I have found that the knife works well for a rapid open in the left pocket. It will take a little practice but worth the time. I am a repeat Cold Steel owner and this may be my favorite one yet. The SNAP of the lock and the ultra sharp point makes a very clear statement that this is a weapon not a tool. It work well as a tool and is okay for every day carry but to be clear you are buying a weapon designed for a very clear purpose .Small enough to carry in all types of clothing.Light enough to be comfortableSharp edge and secure locking systemQuick deploy from pocket or handIt is a good primary or secondary weapon to carry daily.
3380	It feels good to finally have a new arcade version of DDR.: Supernova is a pretty decent machine. The seems right(with all the licensing they do to make these games, you'd have to expect atleast this much). I've been playing DDR since 2004 and think It's the best foot rhythm game todate. In the grove is ok and pump it up....i just hate the 5-panel and menu intergration. A lot of people think In the Grove is a better game just because the steps for the songs are hard, which doesnt make the game itself good. There isn't any orignality with the songs or steps. Every song is just some generic techno. At the highest diffuclty all the songs play the same, no matter how the song sounds. I do like sound quality of the system though. its among the best. The pad is nicely made as well. to put it simply, DDR just provides a funner experience. when i play in the grove all i think is why am I doing these steps and when will the song be over.
3381	waste of time, preview exceeds movie!: I could not even finish watching this. It was dry, slow moving, and pointless. I watched for 50 minutes thinking that it would get better, no such luck. I turned it off and watched broadcast TV instead. The previews made me want to watch this. I was extremely disappointed.
3382	Nice looking & heavy enough: Although these are not inexpensive, they are worth the $ since they are heavier than other, cheaper ones I've used. Also, quite pretty.
3383	Serviceable: Considering the price I was pleased with the quality of the tools included in this kit. Especially the Seiko style opener (easier on the hands + easier to control). The thumb screw pocket case wrench is adequate & the quality of the tweezers is very good (compared to expensive Swiss tweezers). If you're going to change watch batteries this tool set is better to have than not. Being retired, SERVICEABLE (reasonable & adequate) is my favorite word!
3384	hope this helps: I love this cd its my favorite Disturbed Almbum and the Lyrics are great.voices- 4/5The game- 5/5 Everytime I hear this song I jsut have to sing along it doesnt matter what kind of mood im in.Stupify- 5/5Down With the Sickness- 5/5 I play this song everytime im angryViolence Fetish- 4/5Fear- 4/5Numb- 3/5 A little different from there other songs.Want- 3/5 not one of my faves.Conflict-5/5 great song.shout 2000- 4/5Droppin plates- 5/5 deff. one of my favorite Disturbed songsMeaning Life- 5/5
3385	CAREFUL! NOT FOR US MODEL 2007 NISSAN PATHFINDER!: Be sure to double-double check the part number when ordering, and make 100% sure your air filter matches both the MODEL and ENGINE of your auto. Use ONLY the sizing guide on the K&N website as the Amazon compatability guide is incomplete and many cars that share the same OEM air filters cannot share the same size K&N filter. If you are buying this for a 2007 NISSAN PATHFINDER note that this will NOT fit in the US 4.0L gasoline model but only in the non-US 2.5L diesel model.
3386	not an ABC learning book: This is a soft cover book only good for pictures of Elmo. It does not have the letters displayed in bold fonts for children to learn. The cover is very misleading.
3387	Hype does not equal quality: I've never really liked Matt Drudge. Never really hated him, either. His website is sometimes informative, sometimes annoying, sometimes uncoscionably biased. Unfortunately, this book tends towards the last two. Thumbs down, Drudge!
3388	No smudging or smearing: By far the best paper I have used in our plotter. Other rolls don't hold the ink as well, and when handling, often rub off on fingers... this paper does not. Inexpensive and perfect for mock ups and decent prints.
3389	Was this really a Wide?: I've been buying Reebok Princess for years and this one just seemed like it might have been mislabeled. It feels more like an R on my foot. JMO.
3390	Exactly what I expected: They sent the book in like new condition. I got what I paid for and would buy from them again.
3391	Great Jeans!: My husband likes the faded look and they are so hard to find in his size (40x34) in the stores. These look great.
3392	HURTS SO GOOD: MADLIB AND DECLAIME HAVE UNTAINTED CHEMISTRY. IF YOU ARE INTO SMOOTH TRACKS WITH CREATIVE LYRICS THAT KEEP YOU BOBBIN' AND WAVIN, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS CD. THESE CATS ARE EXTREMELY CLEVER AND THEY MAKE ME FURTHERMORE PROUD TO BE AN UNDERGROUND HEAD. KEEP IT COMIN' LIB!!
3393	Cannot remove the seals!: I am a homeschooling mom who purchased this item this summer to make ice cream with my child. It worked wonderful, but we are completely unable to get the seal holding the saltwater undone from the container.I had two strong men and my contractor, who used torque, try to remove the seal and couldn't get it to budge. We are sitting here with an item we have used once and can't use again.We have contacted the company, who made recommendations,which we tried to no avail and when asked for a replacement, recieved no reply. They have been unresponsive to us since. A bad, bad deal!
3394	Fabulous and fitting: The shipping was fast, and the dress was true to size. It fit perfectly. This dress was elegant enough to wear to a formal dinner in front of the Eiffel Tower, and I felt fabulous in it! This dress caught the eyes of many people in fashionable Paris!
3395	Nice to have a kid book about Crohn's, but bad quality: It is exciting that there is a children's book about Crohn's. The author is a doctor with Crohn's, so the information in the book is factual and there are great notes preceding and following the story. However, the quality of this book is pretty poor. It is unrealistic. The whole subject of Crohn's get brought up because the mother serves her daughter a different snack than she does her daughter's friend. No child is going to believe that a mother would do that. Also, the way the children talk to each other isn't credible. The pictures are also not very well done, but I guess they get the job done. It is nice that children will have a book available to them about Crohn's but it is poor literature. I was disappointed. Children with Crohn's deserve a well written, well illustrated book, and I am still waiting for it.
3396	A rocking pilgrim!: I bought this album a few days after seeing Eric Clapton in concert in April 1998. He was then promoting this album. He opened with MY FATHER'S EYES,which was the first hit from this album. That song along with RIVER OF TEARS was reused for CLAPTON CHRONICLES,released in October 1999. PILGRIM is from the Mel Gibson-Danny Glover movie "Lethal Weapon 4". BORN IN TIME was written by Bob Dylan. ONE CHANCE and INSIDE OF ME have hip-hop style R & B. I heard SHE'S GONE on the radio so I believe that was a hit also. All the other songs are good.
3397	Not suitable for Australian KitchenAid Mixers: What a shame it is packaged as being suitable for all KitchenAid Mixers when it is not! Beware Australian customers, you will have to purchase additional parts to make it work on your Australian Mixers.
3398	Nylabone Big Chews: These were half the price they are in pet stores, and my dogs love them. It's great to get the huge Nylabones at an excellent price. Also, they arrived very fast.
3399	Pitiful: Chair does not lean back and I practically slide out of it. I can only find one position which is moderately comfortable, but I cannot sit at it very long without getting back pain. The controls just manage the position and degree of pain you will reap from sitting on this thing for very long.
3400	Amazing story of the men who fought WWII: Danny Esposito, aka Abe Cohen, is a man hiding from his past. He's changed his identity and joined the army, in an effort to escape those who might want to find him. What he doesn't count on is the war. When the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, he finds himself sucked into the vast conflict. What he learns about himself and the world while fighting we change his destiny forever.Interweaving Danny/Abe's story with a detailed acounting of the fateful attack on the Rumanian oil fields at Ploesti, this story combines a gripping story of the terrors and triumphs of combat with one man's story of self-discovery. The descriptions of combat are detailed and utterly convincing, and provide the backdrop for Abe's growing realization that there is more to life than he's ever expected. As someone who has always been fascinated by the men and machines that made up the Army Air Forces in World War II, this story kept me engrossed from beginning to end.
3401	"The Beav" is the best!: The show's content and messages are timeless treasures that are enoyable for all generations. Leave it to Beaver portrays family life in a positive way. In today's society this is hard to find. This dvd set is a great one to add to your family movie collection!
3402	Motor and R/C components make this a huge disappointment: Enjoyed building the set with my son. The RC components lasted about a day before the rear gear became stripped and the car no longer moved. Looking at the car, these are really low end components - not in line with the erector set components. Would not recommend. Buy either an erector set or a RC car - this set is a bad combination.Erector Radio Control Tuning Street Racer Set, 368 Pieces
3403	Total Torture: I cannot express how horrible this movie was! Not only do you have to stare at Matt Damon's face for over two hours, but it also burns in your mind as you are knodding off while watching this bore. The movie was dragged out, with every cheap attempt to throw twists and turns that were completely not needed. The only bright spot was the acting of Jude Law, who is absent in almost the whole last 1/4 of the movie. Matt Damon and Gweneth Paltrow both over-act unbearingly. If I wanted to torture my worst enemy, I would tie them up, and force them to watch this unbelievable trash!
3404	Good Driller Thriller: Driller Killer is about a trouble man who picks up an electric drill and can't put it down. First, he takes to the streets and starts killing off homeless people. Then he starts killing those he believes have wronged him. I will say that the first half wasn't that great. It's not much of a horror movie at first, but things really pick up at about the halfway mark and it becomes a gory slasher flick. And a good one, too.
3405	Not the old Ironman I used to have!: I got this watch just a couple of months ago. This is my third Ironman. My first one which I loved, was stolen. My second one was also fantastic and I retired it only because after many years the band cracked apart and was not replaceable. This new one, I thought the cloth band would be better- but it does pop open a lot. Ok I can live with that, but, the watch has been malfunctioning and going blank on the face. It goes in and out and sometimes has to be reset. Right now it seems to be waterlogged which is odd because I shower but don't even swim with it. For a brand new sports watch that's hardly acceptable.I never had that issue with my other ones. I now have to try to return it for warranty repair. Not even sure how to do that.
3406	Nice look,but thats about it: I bought this mouse. I read what others posted about it, and bought myself one too.But this is not as good as one would think. First off, their are some reach flaws in it. The 2 buttons to the far left,on the side are not too easy to reach your fingers to.The next thing I hated about it was that their is this bump on the right site of it, I dont have a clue as to what its for,but I annoning as anything.I could not stand so much, that I filed it down. 3ed off, the bottom mouse pad touch areas are not well done. So if you have a heavy hand, like myself, it tends to catch on the mouse pad.Other than that, the mouse looks nice, I'll give it that. And their are some neat button settings you can toy with.But all in all, I did not like this mouse. I found it just too hard to deal with.
3407	Worst thing ever invented: You know, sometimes we have things around the house that have been "Mickey moused" or just learned to live with. I did not realize until today how much of a piece of junk this is. When we first got it, the volume knob stopped working within a few weeks, it makes crusty sounds. The radio does not stay tuned in, the on-off button stopped working within 2 months so if we wanted to turn it on and off we would have to unplug the bulky cable. The iPod dock makes a loud hum sound with no audio, the only way we can use the iPod is by using the auxiliary plug in the back (cable not included) If it were anymore possible to get something to be crappier than this, I would like to see it - I would be amazed. Absolute garbage, not even worth it if it were free.
3408	Nice quality material: Bought for a pack n play. They work fine but just a tiny bit too big. I can take care of that by tucking extra material in before placing mattress on the bottom of the crib. Would recommend.
3409	Want to move on ..: This is book is okay for someone wishing to understand the protocols and the building blocks that make up the protocol stack. But its emphasis on the applications is very, very poor.I personally think that the numerous companies now have invested money in the building blocks and now want to benefit from developing applications, which can be sold to their customers.This book does not add anything new for me.
3410	strBook = "load_of_crap": Out of the dozen or 15 Wrox Press books we have at the office, this one is the only one I regret buying. If you own any other Wrox Press ASP books, DON'T BUY THIS ONE -- IT'S REDUNDANT to the nth degree! Truly, if you own ANY ASP books, or have any ASP experience, whatsoever, this book's probably not worth your money.
3411	Poor quality!!! problems with resolution and shadowy image: I bought this 4 port kvm to hook up mi xbox mi desktop and mi laptop... since i have 2 port kvm same brand hooked up with my 22 inch monitor, the funny thing is the item is low quility it arrived with little scratch also the image with the 4 port kvm is blurry shadowy.. isnt clear with the 2 port kvm is not perfect but at least is clear and you dont notice also with the laptop it doesnt get all the full resolution... wich is weird because with the other kvm and also hooked up directly with lcd tv i have no problems with the resolution of the laptop... all i can say is buy at your own risk as i did but also im sure like me youll regret the buy... is pure garbage im sure out there is another one that works better...i would only recomend the buy if you are going to hook it up with something that doesnt require alot of resolution or a clean image
3412	If you didn't get Black Velvet Flag, you won't get this.: Classic Misfits songs redone in a jazzy/lounge style? Genious. It's different. Some will like it, some will hate it. No one can deny the fact that it's pretty damn original (I highly doubt the Nutley Brass has any knowledge of Come Recline with Black Velvet Flag) Same idea..take something timeless, and put a different variation on it. It's a good piece to add to the collection. Well, happy listening and if you don't get it, thats your problem.
3413	weight loss yoga: Everyone thinks yoga looks easy, well I'm here to tell you its not all thateasy. You can feel your body aching during and after the work out.
3414	Wild ride thru a cat's eyes.: Cheers to Tad Willams! I'm starting to wonder if a CAT really wrote this book, because everything is seen perfectly thru a cat's eyes. Great adventure, filled with action, humor, and the process of self-dicovery. If you have children, don't read this book at them, because at one point (Hearteater's Mound) it gets a little scary. Overall, wonderful, wonderful book!
3415	Does the job, easy to transport: I've used this mat several times now, and though it's not very padded it's easily more comfortable than an ordinary blanket or towel. I've used it on inclines and it doesn't slide. It's easy to transport due to the handle and strap. I haven't tried it on wet ground so I can't comment on how waterproof it is, but it's made to fold in a way such that whatever it was on (dirt, etc) won't get on the side you sit on.
3416	Slow and Boring: I wasn't sure what the movie was about. Whether it was about someone trying to write a story, a man looking for answers or the ship itself. The plot and the storying line is a little rough or rather non existent. There is alot of paranormal stuff in the movie but very little is said to clarify what happened to the staff and passengers. There is alot left unsaid. The only reason I gave this film 2 stars is because of the sound. If you turn off your t.v. you can listen and imagine a better movie...
3417	Great Measuring: I like this tape measure. It is big, so it is easy for my 3 year old to play with and measure things around the house. She got it last year for Christmas and is still playing with it a year later.
3418	Great summary of research and useful to have the tools: This book is great in that it provides the actual survey tools used to assess the human-animal bond, as well as references where to find where the tools have been used. Wonderful that this information can be found at your fingertips! Would appreciate clarification on whether we can freely use these tools. Highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to evaluate human-animal interactions, even in regards to other types of research, such as compliance in other aspects of veterinary medicine.
3419	Just what I wanted: It had all of his greatest books like tell tale heart. And the table of contents worked just fine. I RECOMMEND for teachers.
3420	Bob Hope collection: The quality was great. I thought it might be grainy ~ but it wasn't. They're great movies with wonderful memories. The quick wit humor without the worry of somebody dropping the F bomb or nudity is fantastic. To be able to watch clever dialog with your kids ~ especially when they are advancing from cartoons. Definately a worth while investment!
3421	Contemporary Philosopher: James Redfield writes solely on the topic of human spiritual awareness. His books are not meant to be read for a fictional adventure. Rather the story is simply analogous to his philosophical teachings on our everyday lives. He is a contemporary philosopher, and when reading the Celestine prophesy you need to look beneath the surface of the plot in order to interpret the significance of what Redfield is saying.
3422	somewhat crappy: of course you can't expect the ps2 experience to translate to the psp. gameplay is entirely different, even with gamebreakers and such. would make a great way to pass time on long flights or rides if there were mini-games.
3423	Bring back the 1959 version please: I'd also like for the soundtrack album to be released. I searched the internet for a week trying to find this version of the soundtrack. Luckily one Saturday, while garage saleing, I found it. I am in Porgy and Bess heaven now.
3424	Child Vesion of D&D: This game is reallly boring and there is nothing new or revolutionary about it. The spells are mediocore and the gameplay is hack & slash.Not a true RPG!
3425	don't blow on it: this tent is so light weight that if a small wind comes the tent will go down. it would be great inside a house. i returned it
3426	More May Sarton: As her life changes and age creeps in, the internal drive and communication with her garden, the sea and a variety of friends and would-be friends fill the pages and kept me up too late into the night.
3427	Seems great: The swing came right on time. I was suprised that everything was in order because the price was so cheap! I found the swing at a few stores for over $100 and refused to get it for that price. The swing was easy to put together and I can't wait for my daughter to get here and use it. The music and motion is easy to take (some swings are so annoying!). Overall I am very pleased with the purchase. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because I have yet to use the product.
3428	Have the right equipment: I wasn't too keen on this product. All the TV's I have in my house do not completely shut off and continue to suck electricity so this product does not work. The company does warn you but I wasn't sure if my TV's were included in that. Now I know. I might be able to give a better opinion if I had a TV it worked on.
3429	Mark from Houston: Good or bad, what was delivered was a newer replacement version of the E4c-n's. Still very happy with the headphones I received. Was delivered in the time promised. Even though it was not the E4c-n, it was just as good, maybe better. One disapointment is that the newer version did not include a level attenuator as promised. I got the scl-4.
3430	NOT WORTH THE MONEY: I WOULD NOT BUY BIRKENSTOCK AGAIN. IT IS EXPENSIVE AND WORKMANSHIP IS MEDIOCRE. ONLY AFTER A FEW MONTHS, THE STRAP BECAME UNGLUED. WHEN I CONTACTED BIRKENSTOCK, THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING, EVEN THOUGH I SENT THEM PICTURES OF THE SHOE.
3431	Labels Unlimited 2.0: This software is written for Windows 95. It is fairly stable in Win 98/ME though it did present occasional lock-ups. It has been a real nightmare, for me, with Windows XP requiring uninstalling and restoring to an earlier setting. It slowed down my machine to the point it would take 12 minutes to load a program. I warn anyone with XP to steer clear of this program.
3432	My Personal Prayer book for MOTHERS: Is there ever a time you don't know exactly what to pray for your children? This book gives you the scripture and what to pray. It is very helpful and has many subjects pertaining to a specific problem or area of concern.
3433	never got to use it - leaked right from the package: Was disappointed with this soother because it leaked before we had a chance to use it! the fluid was coming out from the soft vinyl links.
3434	Best product ever: I love this device more than my iphone and that says alot. So far have bought 3 kindle's, one for myself and two as gifts for family members who love them just as much as I do. This would have to be the best gadget around and I can honestly not praise this machine enough.
3435	Jeanne Marie Reborn!: This is a charming series of stories with delightful illustrations which has captivated two generations of readers in our family - my wife when she was a child, and now our daughter. They are faithful reprints of the original story and illustration, and are perfect for the toddler to 5 age group. We are hoping that more of the stories are brought back into print soon.
3436	A CD-R ?? WTF ???: I bought this, imported it, and for what ? A CD-R !! Where is written on the product's page that the CD is a CD-R ? Is the artist knows that ? Ridiculous !! Don't buy this.
3437	Way too big: I ordered this set for my husband and when it came in the mail I returned it. The set was way to big. I had read the reviews before I bought it and saw that some people said it was a big set, but I figured how big can big be. This set would be good if you have a really big gas grill and you cook big burgers, but we only have a small coal grill.
3438	Good!: I really liked this book, but it should be called 'Found Puppy.' In the beginning, Stella helps some horses out of a burning barn. Then, Stella isn't allowed to get her puppy out of her house when she evacuates. At her aunt's animal clinic, Stella finds a kitten. Stella falls in love with the kitten, but is very worried about her puppy.
3439	A Nice Read And Very Useful: Actually I found the book to be very useful. It was very basic at showing the color correction tools which is exactly what I was looking for. The explanations were short and concise which is what I like. I realise that everyone has their own color correction tricks which have to be developed in time, so I wasn't after that. I feel the book is very useful for those trying to make use of color correction tools.
3440	Great story and editing.: The scenario is awesome overall, and the the story is very interesting, I don't want to say much because I don't want to spoil anything, but its a very heartwarming story that is as close to a chick flick that you can get..
3441	Against all odds: Amazing, stents unable to care for their children , so the children had to raise themselves and sometimes the parents too
3442	Horribly disappointing: I would not recommend this book to anyone other as a "what not to do" when writing a novel. The grammar, writing style, editing, and lack of character development totally detract from the mediocre plot. I honestly feel the author had a good idea for a storyline and for her characters. However, the book falls short of hitting the mark.
3443	Charger charges: Works fine. It charged the batteries that I bought at the same time as the charger and my drill runs like new.
3444	Help! Let me out of the house!!: Help! Let me out of the House!! No, not because it's such a scary masterpiece. But because it is boring, poorly developed, and extremely lacking in character depth and development.Which one is Jack? Which one is Susan? Who cares?I never connected with any of the characters, and I was glad to get through this book. Truth be told, I skimmed the last three or four chapters just to be able to "finish" the book. I was largely disappointed in what could have been a very good book.And, the Christian theme was rather poorly developed, as was the whole of the book. I say jeers to Peretti and Dekker on this let-down of a corroboration.
3445	Life of Jesus Christ and Biblical Revelations 4 vol. set: This is a fantastic set of books that you will want to read through for the rest of your life. So easy to understand and follow. I highly recommend this 4 vol. set to everyone who wants to know the life of God and Jesus better. These are a must have!Life of Jesus Christ and Biblical Revelations (4 Volumes)
3446	A Waste of Time: I thought this would be at least a decent movie, but it was an utter waste of time. The main character is nothing more than annoying and is predictable in every way.
3447	Dinosaurs by Melissa & Doug: A great puzzle for preschoolers. My 34 month old loves this puzzle and will put it together on his own and then take it apart and put it away without any help. The big sturdy easy to clean pieces are great for his little hands to manipulate easily. The puzzle also has very nice graphics.
3448	Lyricism at its best in the short story: Mark Helprin's writing provides a wonderful experience somewhere between the pruned brilliance of Hemingway,the lyricism of Pasternak, and the surreal vistas of Garcia-Marquez. One of the finest short collections I have encountered.
3449	BLURGH": EWWW i lyuv bratz n evrythin but this doll is ugly!!! She looks so cheap n nasty n y r her legs painted ORANGE!!!!! I kept this cloe but i never touch her there is a 1st time 4 evrythin n this is the 1st time a cloe doll has been ugly!. I hate her so much grrr lolpeaceemma xxxxxxxxxxx
3450	It's really bad: The Dresden Files prove that Butcher can write, worldbuild and direct compelling characters. This book has none of these qualities - the action and world are full of holes, with paper-thin characters acting in improbably, unbelievable and cliched patters of interaction.The only reasonable explanation I have is that the books have been written by someone Jim is close to and that he has lent his name to them. If you enjoy the Dresden files and the works of authors like Hobb, Rothfuss or Martin, stay away.
3451	Too Simplistic: I was very disappointed with this book. Not what I expected at all. Buckland's "Complete Book of Witchcraft" if much more informational and flows from topic to topic much better.
3452	Based on Little Men?: I couldn't believe how much they deviated from Louisa May Alcott's characters and story line. To begin with, Jo was not a widow! Her husband was a very important character and a big part of the school. Meg's two older children, twins, Demi and Daisy attended Plumfield. There was no measles epidemic, no child died in their care. Amy and Laurie's daughter, Bess, was 3 years old and never attended Plumfield, but when she visited the kids adored her because she was so sweet and beautiful. There were enough interesting plots in the book to draw from without making such huge changes. The love story between Jo and her husband was actually very interesting. They could have done flashbacks to how they met. It was a shame to leave out the example of a beautiful, lasting marriage just for the sake of making a possible love interest out of a handyman. It lost the point that some of the kids who didn't have parents found new "parents" at Plumfield. They cheapened and dumbed down the story.
3453	Strong Quincy Jones Arrangements: This import release includes two selections on a single disk. Quincy's arrangements soar, and it is easy to see why he was in such demand at this time. I particularly like the "In the Heat of the Night" release, where Quincy's arrangements showcase his command of dynamics, with Ray Charles's wailing lead vocals.
3454	May have no fragrance added but it is not fragrance free: There are ingredients in this lotion that have some kind of scent so it is not fragrance free - it was very aggravating - I had to hop in the shower and wash it off immediately. If you have sensitive skin, I doubt this is a good choice for you.
3455	Where is Hal David when you need him?: I first heard of this CD on an National Public Radio interview. It sounded like it had great potential, which unfortunately it did not live up to.While some of the music is interesting and Mr.Costello does an OK job, the lyrics are just plain awful.
3456	A very challenging collection of standards: I bought this book because there's a nice transcription of Smoke Gets in Your Eyes from the Platters.Some of the chord progressions are very difficult, even for an intermediate/advanced player. The fingerings are quite challenging and I find it really hard to keep things flowing between chords. Despite the level of difficulty, these arrangements are suited for living room performance at best. The chord progressions sound very full but you'll have to add a bit of your own to spice things up.There is no CD with this book, which makes it even trickier for players whose primary style isn't jazz.
3457	Worth 10 Stars: Ella! Ella! Ella! She's really SWELL-A(sorry, I do tend to get carried away at times)on this superb yuletide cd. It doesn't matter whether or not you're into jazz, or even Ella Fitzgerald, but if you want to add yet another swingin', fun, fabulous Christmas cd to your collection then this is the one. Every song sounds like a labor of love, Ella's warm, wonderful voice caresses every note while backed by Frank De Vol's orchestra. Hard to believe the album is 41 years old now, it sounds so nice & fresh today-even more so than recent holiday albums. Very highly recommended.
3458	Where was this guys editor?!: Yea it may contain some interesting anecdotal information but, yikes, what a chore to read. This guy must have failed his freshman writing course! Gross gramatical mistakes, misused words (the author must not own a dictionary), unused words (I don't think this guy knows more than 10,000 english words and they are all in this book multiple times), run cover to cover. My ten year old can tell a better story than this with content that would seem not nearly as exciting. Buy it if you must, but be prepared to dumb down while you sift for the usefull stuff.
3459	Way too complicated of a game, takes the fun out of it: There is way to many dice, and may options on which dice to use and what it does for each turn, way to complicated even for adults
3460	not worth the money, legs break easily: I've had this table a couple of years now, as well as the matching chairs. The chairs are okay. But the table is worse than awful. The legs are fastened by an obliquely set screw in the bare wood, and any pressure on the leg, such as moving the table slightly,or even tightening the screw too much, causes the triangle of brittle wood that holds the leg to the table to break off at the screw point, making the leg useless. You can then turn the leg upside down and drill a new hole to hold the leg in place, but eventually you end up going to a lumber store to replace the legs. The table top is very poorly made, with patched wood and filler. It is maybe worth $80. Certainly for $300, you can get something much better.
3461	replacement water filter is as expected: Ordered this replacement for my 5 year old Amanna refridgerator and it worked exactly as previous ones. I get a year's use out of mine.
3462	Nice Fireplace to relax - 3 loopable scenes: This is a farely good Fireplace for this crowded field. It has 3 fireplace shots each lasting 20 minutes and are individually loopable with your choice of natural crackling fireplace sounds or a music soundtrack.The first 2 fireplace scenes are similar - the first is the beginning of the fire with large crackling flames (see the customer pics above), the 2nd "ambient embers" is a more calming 'older' fireplace with large glowing embers and smaller flames. Both fireplaces are full screen.The 3rd fireplace is in Widescreen. However, it includes some of the outside of the fireplace... so if your plasma TV is grey, it will fit right in. Otherwise, the others may be more appealing.Nice DVD on a cold winters night to curl up and read a book with.
3463	Easy on the eyes and too light on the instructions.: I thought that this would be a good reference for me, as I am new to the whole sewing thing. However, the book has no information in it that I could not find in more comprehensive guides to sewing. The pictures are colorful and the diagrams are somewhat helpful, but there is no information in this book that did not come in my sewing machine manual.
3464	Caution: This could ruin your guitar's finish.: I bought this humidifier largely due to the positive reviews. The humidifier covers the entire sound hole, but it takes a good deal of pressure to fit it into my Martin D-28. When using it, I was meticulous about squeezing all the water out and using a paper towel to soak up any residual water from the sponge and around the rim of the humidifier before I inserted it into the guitar. Nevertheless, the humidifier reacted with the finish around the sound hole of my guitar. I find that completely unacceptable. Use it at your own risk.
3465	A great FF8 companion: I found this book to be an improvement on the FF7 book. The directions are easier to follow, and it includes a lot of important information. I would have liked the names of the Cards to be easier to read - dark font on a dark background is too hard to reference for anything - and the beastialityairy was too hard to decipher. But that's a small point when you compare it to the failure to continue with the total coverage in the FF9 book. This book told me what I needed to know about the little things that I missed - the weapons, the GFs, the magazines (not enough room), and locations like the Islands or the Deep Sea Research Center. It was tremendously helpful. Still is.
3466	This mouse is a man: A resourceful mouse from a well-to-do mouse family shows that even the pampered can muster up some chutzpah when they have to.The writing about nature and the seasons reminded me of E.B. White. I loved it when Abel was holed up in his log during the long, snowy winter and loved the gruff frog named Gower, with his primal trances.My boys, ages 7 and 9, liked the book too. William Steig makes good use of the great wealth that is English. To me, he's right up there with White and Arnold Lobel and Doris Burn (who wrote The Summerfolk).
3467	You'll Pay More Than You'll Want To!: I discovered this gem of a band not from T.V. or the radio, but rather from an AMV I downloaded. The song used was "Bite Your Rhymes" and the anime clips were from the movie "Mezzo Forte". The first time I watched it, I was blown away. So, of course, I went to find the CD and it exceeded all my expectations (which is not very easy to do.)Their music could be described as nu-metal, but contains none of the aggravating flaws that comes with the genre. The lead singer, Jimmy Urine, growls and squeals with ease and the guitar riffs and drum beats are unconventional enough to make a great listen. Just one more proof that the best bands don't play on MTV![...]
3468	Not what I thought: I couldn't even get through the first chapter. Did not hold my interest. I only purchased out of curiosity. But not at all impressed.
3469	Nightmare on Sansa Street: I just bought this e260 (11/08). The player itself was manufactured in 2006 and still being sold as new by Amazon and JR's Computer world.The product information fails to leave out the fact that you can only use a 2gb mirco sd card, it will not recognize anything else. So forget about SDHC compatibility.Speaking of compatibility you can not hear audible.com book content on it and will never be able to.If you want album art you have to find it on the internet and install it manually in each album folder (big pain). Most players will automatically do this when you sync with windows media player or your preferred download service.Now to continue the nightmare I went on the Sansa site to try to fix all the stuff that is not compatible with the rest of the world and it was listed as a "retired player" So you can forget about any support.I just bought nothing more than the electronic version of a gallon of outdated, rotten milk.
3470	Poor Quality Construction: Mine arrived with rivets popped out and the steel where the birds sit is thin and flimsy. I returned this product, and would not recommend it.
3471	Handy English Encoder Decoder: Simple and certainly "handy"! I wish I had this back in my school days. Almost as useful during the schooling years as your Noah Webster's Dictionary, this book clearly walks you through all the spelling and phonics rules you will come across. Written in its clear and precise format, it is quite an aid in teaching the phonics rules to your children, as well as having them seek out the rules for themselves.
3472	not worth the time: I am usually interested in medical drama, but I almost gave up on this book after the first few pages. The language was choppy and stilted. It was supposed to appeal to teenagers, but I am a teenager, and it just sounded fake. I don't think anyone actually talks like that unless they are in Beverly Hills or on TV. It was a soap opera in book form. Just the names of the characters would tell you that -- Zoey, Tristan, Summer... The plot was choppy and I didn't feel like the characters were developed enough to feel any connection with them. There also wasn't very much actual medical drama...the book focused more on the interaction between the SCRUBS and the mean doctors. Finally, the ending was pure gimmick, and while it was a cliff-hanger, it didn't make me want to read the next book.
3473	Lovely but not so informative: As is true of DK's Eyewitness books, this book is full of fantastic pictures. It's great to wet one's appetite, but doesn't really have enough meaty information to help one prepare to visit Andalusia. It's one saving grace: great maps. I recommend this book, but not alone. This is a great companion to The Rough Guide to Andalucia.
3474	Terrible, terrible movie: The HD DVD picture quality is decent enough, and that's the only positive thing I can say about this film. The dialogue is horrible. Nicolas Cage's performance is barely watchable. Kate Beahan's performance is one of the worst I've seen by any actress. The plot is predictable. This film is barely watchable.
3475	Evolution Delusion: Uh, yeah, conveniently these fish and thousands of other "species" magically don't change for millions of years, I and my evidence-based Bible do not think so.
3476	Parental Caution Advised: My elementary school children came home upset that a classmate had been sharing material from this book at school. Apparently, a girl at school was reading this book outloud to them. Her mother apparently had read the brief description and reviews, and thought it would be an enjoyable book for her young daughter to read. Sometimes as parents,we do not have time to read the entire book first, but trust the general info we get from sites like this. Because of my children's concerns, I have now had the opportunity to review this book. This book is clearly not appropriate material for that age. There are graphic, detailed descriptions of premature ejaculation, as well as vivid descriptions of the actual sex act. With the other reviews, I wanted to post this so other mothers could be aware of this graphic content before purchasing for their elementary students. This isn't something that needs to be circulated around elementary school.
3477	Important only to the authors: "Leaving Reality Behind.." is a myopic and biased account of a subject that just isn't that interesting. Unless you were one of the eToys.com employees or one of the 'cutting-edge European artists' of etoy, the 'Toywar' was quite simply a non-event for the rest of the planet. In essence, the authors (who clearly are sided and likely involved with the etoy camp) are trying to dress up a relatively trivial legal dispute over a domain name that is now about three years old. Why is this interesting?? Throw another 'yet-another-dotcom-story' on the pile.
3478	Works good for first year: I loved these sock when I got them! I only wear socks in the winter, and I got these last winter for Christmas. Now, as I sit at the computer, I am wearing them. Unfortunately, the hanes white socks that I also purchased last winter are in much better shape than these. These have worn very thin on the soles and the left one even has a hole in the heel. It pains me, since they cost so much to just throw them away after 1 year of use (not even that as stated earlier), but it seems I will keep using the hanes and stay away from smartwool. I also have 3 other pairs that I bought after receiving these because I loved them so much. They also have been worn through. It seems to be a flaw with smartwool, in my opinion.
3479	Kettle Chips Make Great Mouse Food: After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse. Don't know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch. When my son gets home, I'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon. The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don't know which. I will never buy these again from Amazon. I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase. It makes me sick to think about it!I included pictures at the top of the page. Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.Update: I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn't want them.
3480	Handles fall off.: These are quite lovely, no nonsense steel measuring cups. Until the handles inevitably fall off. I had dreams of having a friend weld or braze the handles back on but I lost them before I could get them to him.
3481	Dumb and Dumber Actresses: Whether by direction or lack of script, these two women are terrible in this movie. I know its camp but man, this was bad. At least I could have laughed through it.
3482	Awful: After having wasted three whole years of my life listening to this seriously sugar-coated mess, I've had enough. A nice voice seriously goes ugly by screaming, and I'm afraid she could be hurting herself, pounding her navel like Tarzan's wife. And I'm not surprised that that song, "My Heart Will Go On," had been seriously overplayed three or four years ago. HELLO? I USED TO LIKE THAT SONG? Why didn't James Horner choose another singer to sing MHWGO? Celine has been famous for singing other people's songs, not just her Barbra Streisand/Liza Minelli-esque style of singing. I don't get it at all.
3483	Be careful....: I own the Gateway AR-230 DVD recorder. I purchased this 25 pack of Memorex DVD+RW's thinking it was a great bargain......too bad it wasn't. The first one I used worked fine, but this only set me up to record something using my timer only to come home and find that the DVD had a write error. The recording was lost, and so was the DVD as it wouldn't read even as it tried to format. I figured it was a one time thing, but the next two Memorex DVD+RW's I tried both failed as well. One would stop after recording for 30 seconds after formatting, and the other couldn't even be read. Then, of course, I thought something was wrong with my DVD recorder, but my Verbatim DVD+RW's work great. If only they were the same price! : ).....anyway, make sure these suckers work with your deck before spending your hard earned $$.
3484	Captivating style.: This book caught me by surprise. I fell in love with the authors style. Her metaphors and similes do a great job of describing the people and places. Ther author seemlessly wove the background of the characters into the story. There were a few details I would have liked to seen or heard more about, but still a highly recomended read. For me, the mark of a truly good story is that it leaves you craving more.
3485	Imagine over 2,500 years of Portugals History in an easy to read paperback: Historicaly precise,not missing any major revolution be it social, intelectual, political, economical...Read it in a day and a half.Whow!!!!
3486	Agree with Steven: I agree with Steven. I tried to save a few bucks by buying this, but there is so much slop in this unit that the only thing consistent with this jig is the inconsistency of the results. I ended up buying the PC 4212 as I have heard very good things about that jig.
3487	peice of junk: This player didn't last 6 months. The jack where you put the earphones in is messed up and now plays only static. The jack also is where you are suppose to power it up- it is suppose to power up automatically- it stoped doing that. Finally, when it was working it took about 10 minutes to load and another 3 minutes everytime you wanted to search for a particular song. Not a happy customer.Rca M4002 Opal Series Mp3 Player With 1.5-Inch Oled (2 Gb)
3488	Love this stuff!: I love this jojoba oil. A little goes a loooong way, so be careful. The first time I used it, my hair was an oil slick! It also has a nice, light smell.
3489	Multiple projects down and more to come!: I purchased the Akuzuki floor nailed back in 2009 to install hardwood flooring (red oak) into our living room which had been carpet at the time. The nailer never jammed, misfired, or malfuntioned in any way - it made the job a breeze. Plenty of power and consistent cleat depth this nailer did its job well. After I was done the tool was put away for 2 years until 2011 when I installed red oak flooring into my kitchen. Once again the nailer was consistent in sinking cleats properly, did not misfire, jam, or malfuntion even once.After putting thousands of cleats through this product without any malfunction I can say I would easily reccomend this to anyone. You will save money over renting a floor nailer and can be sure that you are getting a reliable product.
3490	Terrible!: It does not do what it claims to do, therefore I give it one star. I wish I could give it zero stars, though. The cloths actually scratch CDs and DVDs. They also leave lint residue on the CDs. As one other reviewer mentioned, the cloths really do look like fabric softener sheets that you put in the dryer. Don't waste your money on these "cleaning" cloths.
3491	Pampers Cruisers: Overall, this is a good product. The drawback I found so far is that the fastening tabs can be hard and sharp. Sometimes they can cut a mark on baby's belly.
3492	What's more odious than a blackmailer?: A murderer, that's who. As much as Miss Maud Silver hates blackmailers, it does not justify murder in her mind. When she is spending a summer holiday at the seaside with her favourite niece, Ethel Burkett, strange happenings are occuring at a neighbourhood house. Miss Silver gets drawn into it when someone is found dead in a beach house. In this case, the murdered victim has more enemies than enough, and there are more motives than enough so it makes it difficult to find the killer. But, never fear, Miss Silver is there to figure it out, but not before there is another death. This is a book with two murder victims that are both very unlikeable people.
3493	Caused Terrible Brake Juddering after Use on Race Track: I have Performance Friction # 0731.20 and 0732.20 pads in my 2002 Corvette and I would NOT recommend them. I run HPDE events on the race track and they have caused terrible brake juddering (shaking/pulsating) by depositing part of the pad unevenly on the rotor. Since there is no way to fix this, I have to remove and discard these pads rotors. Thank you Performance Friction!
3494	uninteresting subject matter...: does NOT compare to The "Cat Who" series by Lillian Jackson Braun, whose books were humorous and easy to follow fiction
3495	Handy Book: Great book with lots of handy ideas and tricks to help keep things clean the "natural" way.
3496	Should be called the Infernostasy: I love this album although I am also disappointed in it. It is definitely not Demigod. The overall atmosphere is no where near as dark as Demigod and it seems that band did not really evolve with the exception of Inferno. Inferno ultimately earns 3 of the 4 stars I gave this album and definitely outshines the other members of the band.
3497	Beautiful collages: I have been searching for these cards for literally YEARS. I had a set at one time, but the series has been discontinued for awhile now. Thank goodness for Amazon! This seller sent the box of cards out right away, and I received them within 3 days - in *perfect* condition. I am thrilled to have them back, and so thankful for such good customer service: prompt, affordable, and careful. I would definitely buy from him again.
3498	Ce livre est HOT!: I bought this book and it goes through a bunch of phrases common to Quebec. There's also a short pronunciation guide and minor pronunciation tips throughout. I gave it a 4, because it would have been better with a cassette tape to teach you how to pronounce these words :)
3499	NOT all "Crystal" or "Clear Fluorocarbon" strings: These are NOT all "Clear Fluorocarbon" strings as implied and printed right on the box (picture on Amazon differs from box I got). The third and fourth strings are wire-wound and not even with the same color or type of wire. I didn't even attempt to put these on my uke. I threw them in the trash and ate the loss.
3500	Not so much a translation as an apology: I wrote a detailed review many moons ago about how this edition is not so much a translation as a rewriting. Ali fails to take this opportunity to address the well-known problems such as the grammatical and historical errors, and instead adds words throughout the text to make it more palatable to Western readers, in many places changing the meaning completely. In fact this distortion of the text should be considered blasphemy, if not for the fact that some adherents consider deception to be an acceptable means of advancing the cause.The fact that all reviews for this item seem to have been quietly removed perhaps speaks volumes about the plain meaning of its unadorned teachings, discomfort with what Ali has done, or the power of its adherents to silence doubts.
3501	Horrible!: Truly terrible movie and i just cannot justify any reason why you would want to waste your time with this film, and like the last line of the film says "we are going to need some rope and duct tape" for the director and all his staff !!!
3502	JOHN LEE AWSOME EARLY RECORDING: This is a fabulous recording of Hooker's acoustic work. John Lee is certainly one of the very best blues musicians, just as comforable acoustically as he is electrically. What a great CD. Get this one if you like the blues. It is a real treasure. I wish that this had been released sooner but then again, all GREAT things are worth waiting for.An other interesting thing to do is to listen to this, or a few songs, and then some Buddy Guy acoustic. you'll find such a similarity in style and beat.Have fun!
3503	incredible second come-back!: Wire have managed this again. They are back for a third time and it is even better than the second come-back.
3504	Another rip off: Do not buyThe theatrical versions were poor by comparison with extended ones.Do not be tricked into buying them twicePerhaps when they are left with unsold inventory they will learnWould rate it lower than 1 star if I could
3505	Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: The Hours has an audience in people who share the void suffered by its characters. That void is where a life is supposed to be. If you are one of these people, then get a life. The rest of us found The Hours unforgivably dull.
3506	Forever Love/Forever Young (2 pack): We received the DVD "Forever Love/Forever Young" on time in new condition. This product is a wonderful addition to our library collection. Thank you so much.
3507	New Heights in Conspiracy Theory: Despite its hype, this book adds nothing to the historiography of Abraham Lincoln or the Civil War. Numerous other negative reviews detail the text's numerous technical inaccuracies, and there is no point covering that ground again. I find it difficult to call this work a history. It contains no new information of consequence, and reflects no meaningful original research. Its conclusions are based on assumptions that are in many cases fallacious, and it advances its "interpretation" by setting up absurd "straw man" cases and then "proving" its point by knocking them down. In consequence, it offers no genuine insight into the period. This work is more in the nature of a neo-conservative rant about "big government" masquerading as a "study" of the civil war era, written to advance an agenda rather than historical understanding.
3508	A Revolution in Cognition?: Published 20 years ago, founder of NLP, this book was edited entirely from audiotapes of introductory NLP workshops. Amazing and interesting view on cognitive behavior and communication. It is a dramatic new approach to traditional psychological therapy, a turn around to say the least. The imperative is that each individual has the potential for change and that each and every single piece of behavior has a positive function in some context. People process language at the unconscious level, and typically the counscious mind is the one that knows the least about what's going on in their behavior. The mechanics seems rather complex for the reader who has his first approach to NLP but ther is an abundance of other books written on this subject which will broaden your possibilities of applying this technique on a professional or personal level.
3509	Harley manual: The binding on this book was totally shot. I removed the ringed binder he sent with it and the manual fell apart.
3510	This Is A Piece Of History..... Dont Sleep!: Takin it back to the roots. True New York B-boy History... This is exactly what i've been wanting to see since I started B-Boyin. Know the roots of this nasty dance style. Its full of B-Boy legends both known and unknown by the scene. And besides the bangin main feature, its full of bonus material. Like I said before if you are a B-boy, into hip hop or want to know about a new york underground street movement that turned worldwide in less than 30 years.... DONT SLEEP!!
3511	Ignore this book...: A good science fiction book should have you wanting to read it. You would not want to put it down, waiting to know what would happen next. This book seemed to drag on. Everything that I found interesting in the first book was not there. Instead there was nothing but a small but slightly interesting shell of a story wrapped up in a soap opera like atmosphere. It also has an obsession with sex that I can not explain. (but it gets A LOT worse in the third book) The series goes downhill geometricly after this one so dont bother.
3512	Terrible: Her singing is terrible... I would recommend getting the album of an artist who can actually sing.
3513	overpowering smell: At first I was impressed by this dishwashing liquid...The scent and the cleaning ability seemed great after the first wash. But, we soon realized that the scent was somehow being absorbing into all our plastics including our sons bottles, plastics spoons, spatulas etc. and was overpowering the taste of food. If you never use plastics in the dishwasher, you might enjoy this product, but in our house it just doesn't work. We've gone back to cascade...maybe all natural isn't so great after all.
3514	Boston: Guitar Play-Along DVD Volume 31: I was sitting around, Smokin', when I got More Than a Feeling reminiscing about the Long Time ago when I was in a Rock & Roll band. I couldn't get any Peace of Mind, so I got onto Amazon, started browsing, saw this DVD and thought, "Let me Take You Home Tonight". Well, it didn't happen than night, but Amazon shipped it quickly which gave me some Piece of Mind. I Don't Look Back on the purchase. Like the other Hal Leonard DVDs, it is fun to play along to the tracks and if you play guitar, the songs are pretty quick to learn. Four stars because the interface could be better for learners with a feature to slow down the tracks. Other than that, enjoy.
3515	Too Big: These work great, but are way too big. Waste of good filling when no one can finish them, adult of child.
3516	Box says 12 and I only received 11: Sharpie are great - but when you order little items like this, you dont expect it to get it wrong.I got so dissappointed that the box is suppose to come with a dozen pens and my box only came with 11 pens.Its annoying when its so small but it seem like quality control of having the correct amount is not there.
3517	worked short time: It wasn't close to original, i mean for this price I can not complaint because it is not comparable with original gigantic price. The speed of transfer is slower and charging speed as well.
3518	why would chinese cooks write vietnamese recipes: The recipes in this book suck big time. The authors should stick to making stuff for Panda Express. Leave Vietnamese cooking to real Vietnamese - not any random Asian will do.
3519	ABSOLUTELY AMAZING: I do not normally read biographies. I was turned away from them because most biographies are long and boring, and simply state the facts. This biography, on the other hand, was not long and boring, and while it did state the facts, they way to make the reader fall asleep. In fact, as in many of Fuller's books, this biography makes the reader want to keep reading right up until the end. I am impressed by Mr. Fuller's amazing writing talent, and look forward to reading many books written by him in the future.
3520	An awful remake!: This 2004 version is a total disaster. There is simply no comparison between this version and the 1965 movie, as the old movie is far superior in every aspect: drama, suspense, cast, story telling, and on and on.In the first movie, you had a sense of why things happened the way they did. The acting quality of the actors in the old movie is far superior. Unlike the new movie, it portrayed a great display of the clash between the cast's characters. The conflicts in the new movie gave me the impression of fights between children, kind of working during a picnic. It is laughable, but the new movie portrays the Gobi dessert as a far cleaner place than the Sahara, because the characters in the new movie always appear very clean.If you want to see a really great movie, see the old one, and forget about this one.
3521	Reese's mom: The Baby Papasan is very nice for newborns, now that my daughter is 2 months + old, I wish that I would of picked a bouncer with more toys for her to interact with. The material is very nice and washes well. The attached blanket is a convienence. She seems indifferent to the music and vibration. The angle of the chair is nice for feeding her a bottle. Overall, this is a good quality product yet, lacks room for developmental growth.
3522	Lacks important details: I read this over the summer. You would be better off saving yourself the money and going to apache.org. This book lacks important details for anyone that is new to apache. She expects to much out of the reader. The way she suggests to implement apache is confusing and useless. I believe this book is outdated as well. I just purchased Web Application Design and Implementation: Apache 2, PHP5, MySQL, JavaScript, and Linux/UNIX (Quantitative Software Engineering Series)by Steven Gabarro. Hopefully it will be better than this train wreck definitive guide.
3523	STAY AWAY!: This dictionary is poorly edited (with numerous typos), incomplete (random information that does not reflect the needs of a basic speaker) and, in parts, embarrassingly childish (the introduction suggests, among other bizarre comments, that Bosnian may be too difficult to bother to learn well? ).Although it is difficult to find detailed Bosnian dictionaries, older English/Serbo-Croatian variants are still quite relevant (the nuances for advanced usage notwithstanding) and the English/Bosnian dictionary from Nikolina S. Uzicanin is a SIGNIFICANTLY better purchase (for a pocket-sized book) than this one.
3524	Cats In Time Book review: The type of reader that should read this book is a reader who likes to go on adventures. The protagonists are Gareth and Jason. The antagonist is Gareth. My thoughts about Jason is the I like how he's always into adventures and knows how to solve any problems. I also like the way he can fit into his surroundings, meaning that he can dress up like the people that are in the country he's in. My thoughts about Gareth as the protagonist is that I like how he has the power to travel around the world. If it wasn't for him, Jason wouldn't be able to go home. Another thig I like about Gareth is that he can talk. My thoughts about Gareth as the antagonist is that he gets Jason into a lot of trouble. Like when Jason almost got his head chopped off. My thoughts about the book is that I liked how the author described each person Jason and Gaeth met. I haven't read anything else by this author, but I think I will.
3525	Non-replacable batteries: I like my trimmer, but be warned, when the internal batteries die, a perfectly good trimmer is not usable. Batteries can't be replaced, and it can't run corded.
3526	Nightmare off shore: The unit isn't bad. Worked well for 8 months before it died. That's when the trouble started. Sony service is a nightmare. After 4 transfers between off shore service tech sites (with the bad accents can hardly understand what they are saying)and 5-15 min holds at each I arrived at the supposed right place. I have a phone that keep track of call times and it reported a 83 minute hold time. I got the represenative, talked for two minutes, was placed on hold so tech could talk to his superviser and was hung up on. Called back, and again the transfers and an 80+ minute wait. Then I was transfered to another tech (the last hurtle). I ended up with a tech shop 100 miles from my home. After all of this the last insult was that I was required to pay shipping to the tech shop. I strongly suggest that you buy from a more reliable company.
3527	Great movie: It had a little of everything, a love story, action, suspense, fiction all wrapped up in a great package, ie Matt Damon. I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it.
3528	Stools: This is a nice pair of stools for the price. They're a little lighter than I thought they'd be, but still sturdy. It only took about ten minutes to have them out of the box and set up against our kitchen island. I recommend them.
3529	Does it really work?: I put this in a 37 gallon tank which uses a mechanical filer with carbon filter. So I put this pouch right next to the carbon filter with the hopes of having a clearer water.well, it's been about a week and I don't see any difference. Things could change, but I don't see any indication of hope for now.Maybe I'm using the wrong kind of filter?11/09/12 updatethis product works. I don't know what I was doing wrong in the previous setting, but i bought another bag to substitute the carbons (my Fluval filter has two compartments for carbon bags). the water is as clean as when used carbon bags and I don't need to buy any more carbon bags anymore. if you have doubts about this product like me, remove carbon completely and you will see the difference.
3530	2-port USB Manual Switch: I have my PC and laptop wired through the switch to my Canon MP830 printer so I don't have to fool around changing cables or transferring data when I need to print. Works well.
3531	Horrible!!!!: Went thru 2 of them in less than a week,do not buy ,just save yourself the hassle and go brushless.these things are powerful and alot of torque,but wats the point when its only gonna last a couple runs only.
3532	Great book for young readers!: My son absolutely adores this book. He is almost seven and delights in reading it aloud to anyone who will listen. He laughs every time he reads it. I definitely recommend this book for a child's library.
3533	Lost Sole verse found in Bible Code: Absurd long-words perform surgical intrusions,Impeding the brain with cranial confusions,Convoluted metaphors create pompous delusions,Leaving cyberpseuds with paranoid illusions
3534	Good machine: I got mine yesterday and have used it twice already. The smoothies came out very good. The only complaints I have are1.) It is VERY loud. I live in an apartment and am afraid it will upset the neighbors! :) and2.) The spout clogs easily. I'll just have to add more juice/milk than the smoothie kit says to use. It has a lot of frozen fruit and it becomes too thick.The great thing about it though is it crushes ice VERY well! My blender won't do that.So overall, I really like the machine and recommend it. Just be courteous to your neighbors and use it before 10:00PM! :)
3535	bad light: This light only worked 1 day and die forever.I would not buy this product ever again.How could it be?
3536	Longjohns: This is a great album! Also check out the DM3 self-titled. Soundclips available at cdbaby.
3537	Horrible customer care: This company has the worse customer care ever. I wanted to return the computer because it ran very slow and did not meet my needs to my satisfaction. When returning the item I got one of the worst customer care providers ever. I will never by or suggest anyone buying from them
3538	You Suck, a love story: Christopher Moore is a wonderful and witty writer. This is the second book in the series," Best Fiends;a Love Story", being the first. I enjoyed this book, but,not as much as the first.However,I am looking forward to a third in the series.
3539	pretty good CD: I could not hear the first recording, it skipped to the second piece. But it is good to have it.
3540	Pretty Good Album: This cd is pretty good, but nothing compared to their first cd. I would say this cd ties with "follow the leader" for 2nd best korn cd. "life is peachy" being the least best. And to all those "supposedly" korn fans just because they come out with a new album doesn't mean you automatically give it 5 stars just cuz it's korn. i would defenitley agree with the band that this is an experimental album. Jonathan Davis really experiments with diferrent vocal distortions. Guitars pretty much sound the same as does feildly on bass. The best songs on here are Somebody Someone, Trash, Wake up, Let's get this party started, and Dirty. If you are a korn fan get this album , you won't be dissapointed
3541	Get 40,000 words: The author published an updated version of this book called 40,000 selected words. Get that title - it is fabulous!
3542	Wonderful product and transaction: Great service and just what I ordered! Delivery was quick and prompt. I have a Garmin sand bag in another car and wanted one for this one also.
3543	If it is tuesdasy, this must be Belgium: I bought this DVD just to see Suzanne Pleshette again. I was a bit disappointed as Suzanne Pleshette had too much make up and wig and did not have the grace and simplicity when she did that unforgettable " Rome Adventure ". The only time she looked magical and alluring was when she was wearing that blue top which in itself was the only scene worth watching ....
3544	An excellent source for simple spells: Janina Renee performed a work of magick in itself when she wrote this book. The spells and instructions within it are simple and understandable for anyone interested in Magick or Tarot. The wide variety of spells is also a treat if you are looking for any one specific thing. Money spells, love spells, even spells to bind trouble makers, this book has it all. I highly recommend it.
3545	The best of Raymond Chandler: This book, contaning Chandlers later works, is perhaps the best collection of Chandler you can find. Sure, does not contain the better-known novels - The Big Sleep and Farewell my Lovely - but it does contain The Long Goodbye, which is not only Chandler's finest, but a great novel by any measure.Chandler lived a tough, hard-drinking life, and these later works came out of his mind with difficulty. But the quality of The Lady in the Lake and The Long Goodbye (The Little Sister is less memorable) make this collection essential.In addition, the book contains some essays and letters, including Chandler's writing on the mystery genre, which will interest any budding suspense author.In short, read this book! Read The Long Goodbye, then read it again. This is not just a great mystery, but it is also great literature.
3546	Too Small!: I think they should substitute "Small" for "Midsize" in the description of this item. I just returned it because it was too small. Entire states are on one letter-size page and only major roads are shown. I bought it because the Large Scale Atlas is not available in spiral bound except for the one with the Travel Guide which makes it too big and heavy. I have now ordered the Travel Guide version and intend to tear out the Travel Guide section.
3547	How I would review Fidelity:What it Means to be a One-Woman: The book is right on, but rather discriptive. Not for children, but an excellent resource book for men.
3548	Not what I expected: I really liked the idea but hated the product. It leaks and its hard to spray enough oil for regular cooking. Wonder if I was doing something wrong.....
3549	Multipurpose pancake mix: Pamela's is one of the best GF products available. The pancake mix can be used for many things. Good recipes can be found on the back of the packages. Waffles are excellent. Banana bread is delicious.
3550	An excellent little machine: Since there's only 2 of us these days, the smaller food processor is our best choice. This little machine is excellent. I love it.
3551	DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER: I HAVE BOUGHT SONY NP-FS11 BATTERY FROM THIS SELLER AND IT WAS NOT WORKING, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW...
3552	One of my favorite CDs: I first heard of Smash Mouth on the radio in 1997. I don't know why I waited so long but I got Astro Lounge about a year ago. There isn't a single song I don't like. My two favorites are All Star and Come On Come On. After I heard this CD Smash Mouth easyly became my favorite band. If you are a pop fan get this CD.
3553	Worth a listen: Just as in years past, when a certain "sound" comes in, or in this case, back into the mainstream, there are usually dozens of soundalikes and coat-tail hoppers. The Departure, just like Franz Ferdinand, Interpol, The Bloc Party and countless others are a new entry into the trend of bands inspired by their parent's record collections. It seems sometimes as though each new band has a couple of primary influences that they derive their sound from......as of late, it seems that Gang Of Four has been the flame - with the Departure, I hear a bit of GOF but more then anything, I hear Au Pairs. Actually, if someone were to want a simple comparison, I'd have to say that The Departure sounds like Au Pairs with Johnny Lydon singing.... Certainly worth getting....
3554	works, but has some problems.: Like the previous posters mentioned, this seat does have some problems. You cannot adjust the recline if baby is in the seat. The food gets trapped where the straps connect in the bottom of the seat and you can't clean it out. Our son has thrown up while in the seat and it's impossible to get completely clean. The toys are really cheesy and aren't very entertaining (might as well not be there IMO).The seat works ok, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone since there are other similar products out there that have gotten better reviews.
3555	Made Mummy giggle too: This book was just the ticket for one evening when the bedtime routine seemed to be a struggle for everyone... because it got us all laughing at poor Kipper as he tried to count his toys. What exactly is going on is a bit of a mystery to Kipper -- but the readers start to figure it out before he does. A truly delightful book that had us ALL laughing out loud.
3556	- Be warned -: This is a great book, and the series is very good. If you read the first you will most likely go on to read the rest of the series. So be warned, this series ends up being very religious. So people who do not like to be preached at may want to stay away. Also, i found myself making parrallels with religous history that i found rather offensive. This applies only to the last book, but since this is the first you might as well know what you are getting into.
3557	Terrible read; rambling unintelligible discourse: If only there was a way to give this book NO STARS. This book reads like an eighth grade term paper. Examples are poorly developed and the writing is trite and substandard. I can't believe Adams Media has the audacity to publish this tripe and call it a book. Books are for learning.Some of Michaelson's brilliant insights include: "An inefficient victory is bad, but not as bad as losing -- which is extremely inefficient" and "In every game there has to be a winner and a loser." It's almost like Michealson went to the Dan Quayle school of quotes. Unfortunately, the ENTIRE book is written in the same cheesy prose. Michaelson also has no focus and the book is very poorly organized. Save your money on this one. It might be the worst book you've ever read. It certainly was for me.
3558	Excellent Enchanting Tarot Artwork from Farber and Zerner+: I recently acquired this great Tarot deck and book.And it is really amazing to explore and practice with.What i don't like about the deck is the confining white border around the edges.If they cut off the borders,the deck would be more facilitative and flowing.The artwork is stunnning and magickal.It's a modern tarot deck with a heraldic grandeur and majestic splendor that brings the chivalric past into the mundane present.It's one of the best Tarot decks around today.The book is basically a good addendum,yet most information is a repeat of standard traditional tarot books,like from Arthur Waite and Eden Gray.It's another great montage and collage of Tarot images from the creative divination team of Amy Zerner and Monte Farber.
3559	Fills in the Gaps: I consider this the best biography of these four scientists going. It has the technical foundation that more popularized treatments lack but it has a great sense for the individual personality too. In particular, it has a through treatment of Freeman Dyson's work and background, something that gets slighted elsewhere. I think the insight into Feynman's personality is spot on and correctly assesses the forces that led him to behave as he did as well as achive what he achieved. Read it for the wonderful section on Dyson if nothing else but the whole book is great.
3560	Not in OEM Packaging & 3 times the shipping: I was a little disappointed in these because they were not in the oem packaging and only one had the protective coating on it. Were they used or returns, don't know. I understand costs for shipping but 3 times the cost for buying 3? How about a little bit of a break on shipping when you purchase more than one item.
3561	One of the best albums of all time...: This is the first album I could ever leave in the tape player in my car to just play over and over. There is only one song I would ever skip past, and even that song is not all that bad. Her voice is so phenominal and the music is touching. Even songs that the lyrics arent so deep (i.e. Ice Cream) the melody makes it be a great song nonetheless. If you like Tori Amos, Sting, or just about anybody, you'll love this!
3562	Just Kind of ... Dull: Like many others here, I read this because it was an "Oprah book." I'll give the author credit for detailed descriptions of what the characters had to do to survive ... killing hogs, giving birth unassisted, tending burns and laying out the dead, etc. ... but this book is strongly lacking in any emotional connection to its characters. Not to sound like an acting coach, but "where is the motivation?" If Morgan's intent was to show Julie to be a simple, hard-working, salt-of-the-earth young woman, he succeeded (for me) in portraying only the "simple" part of that equation. She was nothing more than an automaton, getting through each day by moving from one chore to the next. Where was her heart through all this, where was her soul? Vivid descriptions, one-dimensional characters, weak dialogue. I can only give this book 2 stars.
3563	Commie crap: This is a ridiculous propaganda cartoon aimed at discrediting the the opposition to communist infiltration of unions. It was also a veiled attack in people like Charles Lindbergh, Father Coughlin and Huey Long all prophets on the subversion and subsequent decline of America. I'm not a Bogart fan and he is only adequate here. The script portrays white workers concerned about unbridled immigration as racists and morons. Well...check the demographics of America, the strength of unions and the labels on everything you buy.
3564	Just ok to me: My son likes this book just because it has a bear on it, but I find the book slightly annoying to read. The lines flow very poorly. It is my least favorite of the many children's books we own.
3565	Not what I was expecting: The brightness of this spotlight was not strong at all, in fact, we could barely see the light was on.
3566	Very good set: This set has everything you could need in a handy case. The case seems sturdy enough. It might take a second to get the tools back in right but very good set.
3567	terrible: love friday the 13, hated this movie. it does not have enough death scenes and lacks suspense
3568	A Must Have For Collectors: I have had this particular Breyer horse since I was a child and have loved it. It stands very well alone. This model shows Beauty's personality as well as his excellent conformation.
3569	Worth every penny: It is a must have book for every architect and collectioner...it worths every penny that you paid...
3570	Lots of pieces, but beautiful when put together!: I have to admit, when this first arrived and we saw all the pieces I thought NIGHTMARE! But the instructions are relatively easily and it took my husband and I about 2 hours total putting it all together. It is beautiful and sturdy. Only complaints: The drawers are not as smooth as they could be & hardware is kind of shabby and a little loose. We may just buy new knobs that look & fit nicer. All in all we are very happy with it and it will fit baskets about 8.5 inches wide and 12 inches long (that's what I bought anyway from Ikea and they look great). Great value and adorable in a nursery!!
3571	badly made: i bought this as a time saver seem to spend much of that time repairing the rivets that holdthe jig against the door or frame the pins that fall out and fitting different shims and filing down bits in all a waste of time and money
3572	Perhaps the best Study Bible and translation: When I bought this Bible, I was amazed. I have quite a variety of versions from the NIV to the NASB. However, this ranks near the top of my list. The NJB is not too liberal, nor is it too fundamentalist conservative. It is even-handed and the notes, maps, and references are second to none, perhaps only to the NIV study Bible. The translation is clear and fairly poetic. As an evangelical scholarly Christian whose pursuit of God's truth is never finished, the NJB is a treasured Bible indeed.
3573	A Good Introduction to Locksmithing: I'm neither a locksmith nor interested in becoming one, but I did want a basic understanding of the locksmith's art and science when I bought this book. It gave me just that; a nice overview of the different types of locks, some basic service instructions. I would have liked for a bit more information about safes and combination dials, but I understand that the book needed to be limited in scope to keep it readable. The illustrations are fantastic and it had a "taken from real life" feel that many textbooks lack.
3574	killer sex queens from cyberspace: o.k. as far as campy video's go this one takes the cake...no real plot, realy bad acting, some of the footage namely the glori-anne segment was taken from another video. wasnt worth the time to watch or the money that was spent...and i'm a guy who love's cheesy campy video's. most of the video did not make any sence, the plot hole and their were many of them made no sence. this is the typical movie scenerio as if i had the money i could have done better...and it is my belief that anyone else could have...do not wast your money on this major flop. your i.q. will defenitly drop several points after watching this.
3575	Poor Product Quality: I am new to Law and Order, but I really like the series. My problem is with the poor production quality of the DVD sets. The show deserves five stars - the way the DVD sets are produced does not. The episodes are on double sided disks. Can we get any cheaper?In years gone by, DVD collection sets were attractive well put together products. HBO had some of the nicest sets around. Now days, it seems to be all about "how can we produce this product even cheaper, and make more profit?". I would gladly pay a few dollars more to get a well produced product. I'm a collector and prefer something of substance.
3576	Didn't like the voice.: I bought this cd to go with the book and it is very frustrating because the songs on this cd are not even in the same order as the book. The singing voice fluctuates too much, it will be really soft and then it gets really high pitch. And if you have the volume set at a lower level for some songs then you can't hear other songs. I think there are better cds to buy than this one.
3577	American morality: Americans don't give a damn about the people of Iraq. But some americans are more concerned about Bush's reelection so they say that going to Iraq was justified. Over 1100 american's killed based on lies. American morality is in the gutter. This film and the Jesus film are both pornographic and are produced by "conservatives".
3578	Piece of Junk: If I could give this thing zero stars I would. It is such a piece of junk. We bought it brand new and after 6 months the faucet developed a crack and leaked. I didn't keep the receipt (who would think I would need to on a $300 faucet) so I couldn't have it replaced under warranty. I patched it and that seemed to hold for about another 3 months until the sprayer developed a crack and started leaking. I tried patching it the same way and that didn't work. Then the faucet patch gave out and now both are leaking. So I've had this piece of junk less than a year and already have to replace it. If you value your money, don't buy this expensive faucet. It is nice looking but very poor quality.I'm now very concerned about buying any faucet from this company at all. If all their faucets are of this quality I don't want anything to do with them. Do your research before buying from this company. If I would have seen these other reviews I would have never bought this expensive piece of junk.
3579	I enjoyed it.: What more do you want? I'm sure others have more detailed reviews, thus making mine unnecessary. Four more words required.
3580	Too tight around upper thighs: I am a size 30 in jeans so I thought it would be fine if I ordered a size 30 in these. I had seen other posts recommending to order a sizer bigger but I though: "Nah, that can't be my case."I got a size 30 and everything fit nicely except for the part above the thighs. It felt really tight, as if it was going to cut off blood flow. I am super fit, swimmer build but I guess my thighs are above average thickness.I've ordered a size 32 and it was a little tight still but better fit.You might have to order 1 to 2 sizes bigger depending on the thickness of your legs.Otherwise, they seem to be a great product. I've tried them out in the pool, no complaints. I feel more comfortable wearing them because they have a looser look due to the mesh. They look great.
3581	Good flower book: This is an oldie but goodie. The flowers are beautiful and well described. A great book!
3582	A SEAMLESS, REMARKABLE COLLECTION: Geyer's tales are subtly layered, infused with biblical allusion, history, philosophy, myth, and the harsh, unforgiving ambience of the author's native Southwest Texas. His characters, rugged as the landscape that shapes them, emerge before the reader full-blown, fashioned from the clay of the actual, tooled by uncertainty, courage, triumph, tragedy and the unpredictable turns of human love. This is a seamless, remarkable collection of stories by a writer comfortable with place, knowledgeable in the universal yearnings of the human heart. Highly recommended.
3583	super cute: i thought this was a really cute movie and worth watching. girl movie. great lazy day movieathon! Love Rachel McAdams
3584	Best Female Rapper EVER!: This CD rules! Finally a female rapper who can give the likes of Jay-Z and DMX a run for their money. I love her style and her voice. Lil' Kim, Da Brat, Foxey Brown, Missy Eliot - - you all better get outta the way because EVE is running the show now. Just listen once to "Love is Blind" and you'll know what I mean.
3585	The Black Scorpion: This DVD was of very bad quality. It keep flickering and stopping until it just completely froze. I had to remove it from the player and watch another movie. I was very disappointed because this was going to one of my classic Halloween movies.
3586	Meh: I had to read this book as part of a Young Adult literature class, and the attend a lecture by Lois Lowery. I can honestly say, that I wasn't that thrilled with the book. I felt like I'd read it before. I hadn't, but I read a book that had similar ideas that was written in 1938 by Ayn Rand entitled Anthem. Anthem takes place in the future, in a world where individuals have no name, no independence, and no values. All decisions are made by committees and individualism doesn't exist. Giver is essentially about a society that has eliminated pain and strife by converting to "Sameness," a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives.
3587	Was a total rip-off: I used this product once before it cracked. I pushed my blender under the cabinet and the base broke into several pieces.
3588	No words can describe the wonder that is: Slipknot!: With 3 drummers, how can you possibly go wrong! Well, you can, pretty easily, but Slipknot managed to use each of them in such a way that they compliment the entire band to the fullest. I personally love a big band, especially one with lots of drumer (being a drummer myself). The fast paced music really gets your blood pumping. Their music is repetitious, but is also excellent. In all the repetition of rock and metal music these days, its nice to actually see a band where it sounds good. An excellent cd. If you like KoRn, you're gonna love Slipknot.
3589	DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. SHAME ON KODAK!!!!: I purchased this printer after seeing all the commercials on TV that told me how much I would save on ink. WRONG! Did not work at all most of the time. Apparently, they have a defect but still choose to sell them anyway. After much time troubleshooting with customer service, they did send me a new print head which worked for about 6 months. Then, back to no printing at all. As for saving money on ink.... what a crock! Photo quality is the worst ever. My printer from 8 years ago produced a better photo. AND even though most of my printing is on "draft" quality in order to save ink, it tells me I'm out and must replace the cartridge. Yep, $20 color cartridge that is still heavy with ink. There is no override to keep going. It's like it's programmed based on the number of pages, not actual ink used. WORST PRINTER I HAVE EVER SEEN. (and I have spent 9 years as a secretary using many, many, many printers!)
3590	Stick It!: Great product! Don't know why I waited so long to get one. Knowing the exact distance to the pin helps me to stick it close. Made a big difference on my approach shots and has been invaluable on the par 3s. Don't be afraid to spend the extra $ for the slope model unless you play in USGA events (but really, how many USGA events do you play in?) Well worth the money spent!
3591	Otello / Verdi, Domingo, Studer, Leiferkus, Vargas, D. Graves, Schade, D'Arcangelo, Chung: Otello / Verdi, Domingo, Studer, Leiferkus, Vargas, D. Graves, Schade, D'Arcangelo, Chung is a recording under the direction of Myung-Whun Chung who leads Orchestre et Choeurs de l'Opera Bastille on this Deutsche Grammophon recording from 1994. If one compares this with Von Karajan's recording with EMI from 1974 it is quite apparent that the one with Von Karajan is superior. The sound quality is a little better being that it is a Deutsche Grammophon recording. Domingo is amazing in his role as Otello. James A. Hepokoski's essay "'Otello' as Dramma Lirico" is a very well-written essay. Kenneth Chalmers has written the synopsis. The lyrics are available in English, French, German and Italian. It also contains photographs from the time of the recording. Recommended. 4/5.
3592	Fantasy pushed as history: Bellesiles' work has been refuted and he has been shown to be a fraud. Much of his "research" and "sources" were fabrications designed to fit his preconceived anti-gun message. His assertions and conclusions have been demonstrated to be false. If you want the truthful history of guns in America, I would recommend:"Armed America: The Remarkable Story of How and Why Guns Became as American as Apple Pie" by Clayton E. Cramer
3593	SAMSUNG PRODUCT BACKUP: I HAD SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH TV NOT TURNING ON, AFTER HAVING PURCHASE A YEAR AGO. FOR ALMOST YEAR IT WORKED GREAT !!TRIED ALL SOLUTIONS GIVEN TO ME, AMAZON WAS HELPFUL WITH CONTACT INFO. IT TOOK ABOUT 2 WEEKS TRYING TO GET SERVICE, WHEN SAMSUNG COULD NOT FIX PROBLEM, IT WAS RESOLVED BY OFFERING TO SEND ME NEW REPLACEMENT, THIS YEARS MODEL. I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH SERVICE.
3594	This is the second book from this author: I just love her books- they are a fast read and I thoroughly enjoy them. Jane Jeffry's great and I love her friend Shelly Nowak. I read this one in three days. I am excited to read her others.Pick one up today!!
3595	A thirty dollar advertisment for CompTIA and A+ Exam.: Most of this book was devoted to selling the exam. Not much else... Don't buy this.
3596	The Best Product for Hardwood Floors ever: This is the very best product very made for hardwood floors. It cleans, doesn't leave any streaks and makes the floors look new.
3597	Not Bad: THE ONE MOST HATED THING FOR ME IS TRIBUTING I HATE TRIBUTING but that is just about the only bad thing besides the fact that you can only win when you get lucky, like when I summoned 2 eygyptian god cards at once on a glitch and still barely won(btw I have only senn one glitch I would deafinatly buy this game
3598	The Pop bubble busrt: Ok....Definitly not up to standards. I have to admit that they have had some great songs in the past, but this album is a fall from anything they've done. I am not a boyband fan, but I'd stick with Backstreet Boys.
3599	Fraud: It is obvious that many of the beautifully photographed container "gardens" were actually flower arrangements stuck into a pot. Many of these plants couldn't have possibly grown in the container pictured. Bogus!
3600	No wonder Doyle asked Barry to write this book: Barry was supposed to write a chapter in Dolye's Super/System, but when Doyle saw his work he asked him to turn it into a book instead because the material was "too good". I think that Doyle asked Barry to turn this into a book because he didn't want his Super/System book to be complete flop!I have read more than a dozen books on poker, strategy, life of poker players, stories, etc, and this is by far the worst book ever! He filled it with nice pictures so it can be a conversation piece. If you have any interest in poker, buy any other book - even one from Phil Hellmuth.The best chapter in the book is the one about sex and poker. It is very funny because it is so dumb. Pimps have higher morales than this guy, and most can likely write better than him!
3601	I would have rather watched paint dry: I anticipate the arrival of Anita Shreve's latest book and this was no exception. A huge disappointment. Cliche-ridden and just plain boring. 180 degrees from The Pilot's Wife. Even the normally delightful prose describing the New England scenery seemed stilted. The characters were poorly drawn parodys. The story within the story was totally irrevelant. The comparisons made with current events made no sense. I skimmed the last half and then just gave up.
3602	fungus relief: Simply, this product doesn't work. I contacted the seller many times. Each time they promised to refund, but there's no refund. You might as well shop for snake oil - it'll probably be more effective.
3603	Unfortunately: It didn't work with me. After two rounds of the presence process, I developed major depressions, panic attacks and anxieties.
3604	broken headphones: I received these headphones broken. The right ear piece doesn,t work. I would appreiciate a new set of headphones to be set out to me asap. I can return the broken headphones if you would like. Please let me know what is the outcome
3605	Very cool card cabinet: Ok, who really needs this nowadays with digital scanners and cell phones with unlimited contact lists? I do! Its very nice and anyone that sees me digging in for a business card always comments positively.."oh that's so cute":) The little digital clock on the top drawer really works the alpha separators are nice.
3606	Bland!!!: I hate to disagree with most of the other reviews, but this tea tastes flat, bland and a bit bitter. I've searched for a decent decaf tea and finely found three, two here on Amazon, and for less money than the Taylors. Bigelow Organic Breakfast Blend is the best. It has a rich, deep, aromatic flavor and goes well with a bit of sugar and milk or just plain. Higgins and Burke decaffinated Orange Pekoe is lighter in flavor than the Bigelow, but still offers deep amber richness. The third isn't sold on Amazon, but hopefully they'll add it as they carry the Peet's brand coffee. Peet's decaffinated English Breakfast loose tea is decent, too.I use the Bigelow for single cup enjoyment and the Higgins and Burke for making ice tea.
3607	Contents of this set: This is not a review. I just received this set and wanted to list the episodes.Disc 1: Panama, Istanbul, Prague, New York Hudson Valley, EcuadorDisc 2: Harbin China, Maine, Food Porn 2, Caribbean Island Hopping, HeartlandDisc 3: Bonus Features: Burning Questions, Techniques Special, Holiday Special
3608	Good moisturizer for Sensitive Skin: This moisturizer was good, did not cause any acne, provides a somewhat dewy finish. Not the best texture and perhaps alittle bit liquid like. A decent buy.
3609	Can't recommend this product: We have owned this flatware set for about five years. Unfortunately, a few pieces are now missing so I am looking for another set. I wish that I could just buy more of the Henckels Manor to add to what we have because I love the look and the feel of this flatware. However, I agree with others that the quality is poor; our set is now badly scratched and has water spots that cannot be removed (I was blaming my dishwasher until I read the reviews). I do not recommend this product, as much as I liked the set for the first few years.
3610	What's rock 'n' roll w/o Bon Scott and his bagpipes?: Yes, you heard me correctly, Bon Scott plays the bagpipes on this album and you can't help but think what other things he could do! This is one of the greats of the AC/DC collection because it was their first. Great songs include: T.N.T., It's a Long Way to the Top, and Rock 'n' Roll Singer. Inside the cover are letters about each member of the band and they're very entertaining, if you can read the fine print. Great rocking album and if you are an avid AC/DC fanatic like me, for sure you should get this one!
3611	Ok,this is the best jumper ever or pooperoo.lol: Love it.....baby love's it too he enjoys he's play time with this great product also with out failed every time he goes in there my baby does poopo sorry I just had to say it happens every time., lol over all i will recommend this.
3612	good idea, poor sound: i love the around the neck asymetrical cord. having grown up in japan, where this set up was very common, i'm glad to have it. sound is kinda crisp, but very little bass. van halen sounds ok, but black eyed peas sounds wimpy. and the little rubbery thing falls off pretty easily, already lost one for good. it's key to the sound quality, now mine sounds real bass-less.
3613	Very interesting book: The book is great; it follows the Davids in the MLB. They are continually competing against the Yankees who are trying to buy their best players. Yet year after year they continue to make the playoffs and have a similar amount of wins. It shows how people can take an idea that is highly critized and make it work for them.
3614	this thing rocks!: I'm not a flexible person and this makes self massage possible for me. I can hit any trigger point on my back or kneed out any knot. Stop reading the reviews and just buy it and try it yourself. You WONT be unhappy!
3615	Amazing performance by Hilary Swank: Hilary Swank is simply astounding in this film. It is easy to see why she won the Oscar for it. Overall, all of the acting is excellent with strong supporting performances all around, especially Chloe Sevigny as the love interest. The film itself is dark and somewhat dreary and thus, it succeeds in getting its point across. I had seen the documentary beforehand and if you have already seen it, you may find some of the film a little boring. Overall, this is a masterpiece of portraying a segment of our society that is truly frigtening. Anyone needing a good definition of "white trash" need only watch this film. The dvd is very good, great picture quality and features a commentary from director Kimberly Peirce. Several language options are included.
3616	disappointed: I was unable to find a replacement bulb in local stores, so when I found a source online that was great news. I placed the order and received the replacement bulb very quickly. I could not see the stem of the bulb while it was in the package so I had to remove it, when I did I discovered that it would not fit in my lamp even though it was the replacement bulb specified to replace the original"OTT-LITE" light bulb. I was putting it back in the package to send it back when I read the fine print on the packing slip telling me that the product could be returned no problem (if it had not been removed from the package). So I have a light bulb that cost me in excess of $18.00 including S&H, it does not fit in the lamp I needed it for nor does it fit in any other fixtures in my house.
3617	a great jam: it is only a man of eric claptons stature that could pull a guitar jam together of this size, eric is playing some of the best guitar of his life and i especially liked david hildagos guitar playing and guitar tone. i think some of the negative reviewers should appreciate that this historic event was put together instead of being a bunch of bittermens.
3618	A Must For Every Married or Hoped to Be Married Couple: When my husband and I viewed these video's I know it's redundant to say, but it was life changing! Light bulbs kept going off with both of us. We said, "if only" we had known this years ago. But today is a new day and His mercies are new and fresh every morning and Great is His faithfulness. We look forward to spending our retirement with these principles more and more firmly entrenched in our lives. Thank you Emerson and Sarah for sharing these God given time held truths to that s generation that so desperately needs it.
3619	Great product...if: Good product if you use it on hard floor(tile or hardwood etc.)Dirrections are terrible and leave you quessing as to installation. I tested the jammer,it can be breached but with a lot of damage and effort.
3620	Beware of Knee Injury with These Workouts: I wanted to post this review to make others aware that these exercises have lots of squats and jumping. I have just been diagnosed with a patella/knee inflammation in both knees from these exercises in this DVD. Please be careful - I am now in physical therapy for a month to undo the damage from improperly squatting (although I followed Jillian's advice on how to squat according to her instruction). Workouts 2 and 3 are way too intense with stress on your body. I agree with the other reviewers that there is not enough stretching.
3621	Nice toy but better Lamaze ones: Jacques isn't a bad toy but my son loves the octopus and beaver one better. I personally think the octopus is awesome (Captain Calamari) because baby can chew on all his legs. There's also a mirror underneath him so if you hang him from the carseat, baby can see themselves. Love this brand of toys so wouldn't say not to buy, however, my son just wasn't thrilled with it compared to the other animals.
3622	Commercial Beatles suck: What I have realized since I started listening to the Beatles albums, is their commercial single releases suck for the most part. Add to that EMI'S Monetary greed. to keep rehasing the same old songs time and time again. And you have a very unappealing album. The best Beatles songs were never single hits.IN MY LIFETAXMANAND YOUR BIRD CAN SINGTOMMOROW NEVER KNOWSGETTING BETTERA DAY IN THE LIFEDEAR PRUDENCEHELTER SKELTERGLASS ONIONBIRTHDAYSOMETHINGCOME TOGETHERThose 12 songs are real Beatles classics. Only a few on ones are worthy. like Paperback Writer & Eleanor Rigby...
3623	wrong part!!!!!!!!!!!: i ordered the axle carriers for my revo 3.3 and i got sent the axle carriers for E MAX. i had to buy a different bearing for them to fit. i will buy REM parts from now on. REM is more durable and last time i checked offered a lifetime warranty. might wanna check those out before you order the wrong part!!!!!!!!!!!!
3624	DVD Player: Received promptly in good shape. Does a good job for a non-HD player at a great price. Wish I had spent a bit more to get one with a HDMI output port.
3625	Worth Reading: It's a good book worth the reading for every programmer aspiring to be a professional. My only negative comment is that I wish the author presented a logical explanation of the reasoning behind pattern implementations before presenting the actual implementation (code). On many occassions I found myself confused as to why a certain implementation was chosen. I understood the code, but did not comprehend the reasoning behind the code. In many cases, the logic of the pattern was not self-evident (for example read the Observer Pattern).
3626	Review of Shooter: There are a few things I've come to expect of a book whose primary focus is sniping. Most contain a brief history of the art, and some background on training and equipment. Shooter contains very little of this material. It does however have some excellent material concerning the war in Iraq, and the author's ideas on how effective "mobile" sniping teams can be in modern warfare.If you are looking for a reference work on sniping this is not the book, and others such as Out of Nowhere by Pegler and Sniper by Gilbert are better. If you have read these and are interested in how the use of snipers is evolving then I would definitely recommend giving Shooter a read.Originally I had rated this book low, but after rereading it I would change my rating to 5 stars.Tiger McKee
3627	A fan from Missouri.: An outstanding read about an outstanding career soldier. This book's only fault is that it should have been the first of a series. The author was the kind of guy you loved to have on your team, but would never introduce to your sister. Riveting.
3628	Sympatico: Kacey Jones - never heard of her here in Australia until I bought her album of Mick Newbury songs. What a find! Elegant, intelligent versions of some of Mick's best. She clearly loves the songs and the songwriter, and the emotion shows through. Forced to buy several more copies for friends. Wide range of styles and arrangements which I am sure Mick would have approved without exception.
3629	Love It: In addition to loving the DVD, I love the music and the dancing in the movie and recommend it highly.
3630	math blaster: My son loves playing this game, and as a parent I love that he likes it because its a great learning utility. I'd definitely recommend this to any parent who has an elementary school student at home. It has a great entertaining value to learning, they did a great job making this
3631	The best reference for ANC algorithms: This excellent text is written for advanced study and practicing engineers who need to design controllers for active noise control systems. The emphasis is on the algorithms that are usually implemented in a Digital Signal Processor. The book's treatment of acoustics, sensors, and actuators is not as in-depth as texts by Fuller or Nelson. Included in the book is C and assembly code for the most popular adaptive control techniques, but beware of bugs and patent issues. One of the algorithms covered in detail is the Filtered-X Least Mean Squares technique that one of the Authors (Morgan) help to make popular in the community.
3632	A definate for any Oz fan: This book is great. If you never knew how the Tin Woodman became who he is, or want to know what has changed since he left the woods, read this book. It captures what kind of relationship he had with his girlfriend before the Witch cursed his axe and he became the Tin Man that we all know him as and love dearly.
3633	Believable characters: Good writing. Believable characters. Kept me wanting to read more. I felt like I was in the story . Good plot.
3634	Village Records: The book didn't contain the information I was hoping it would. Basically $33.00 for nothing of value to me. I will try and research a book's content more before I purchase another one on just a couple of recommendations. I wish a table of contents had been available to review before I purchased the book. Live and learn.
3635	Helpful for anyone wanting recreate the 70s craft fashion look: For anyone interested in sewing, crochet or knitting clothing in the style of the 1970's this book is a great find. Projects include how to transform a tablecloth into a halter top or dad's boring old dress shirt into a Cossak flavor blouse or tunic. Even just to looking through this book without doing any of the projects presents a good view of ideas that add up to the goofy craft style that was the 1970's I remember. This is more of an idea book than a detailed instruction book. Instructions are given for every project but you are expected to improvise, adjust and fill in the details.
3636	Concise and pratical: Graham gives you the tools to do what needs to be done. He lists websites for corporate research, provides scripts for cold calling contacts and worksheets to keep track of your progress.This book is a gem!
3637	Does not work for me: I do not recommend this product. It is a waste of your money. Rather, try vegetable glycerin. Not only does it work, but it's cheap too.
3638	Boring, Dull, Lame, Stupid: Playboy DVDs in general leave me quite unsatisfied. There are a couple of exceptions, the first Girlfriends DVD and More Sexy Girls Next Door are both very erotic and have some great scenes. I was hoping that this DVD would be more like the More Sexy Girls Next Door DVD but boy was I wrong. First of, this DVD is very tame. There is really very little decent nudity in it, and what nudity there is would easily be classified as PG-13. Second, there is way too much yacking and not enough fondling (if you know what I mean). And third, many of the scense are actually repeated throughout the DVD. My advice is to save your money and avoid this DVD at all cost. If you really want to invest in a good soft core adult DVD, check out some of the older Penthouse titles like Dear Diary, Internet Babes, or either of the two Pets In Paradise DVDs.
3639	Not As Advertised: Spore... The game that was developed for a decade and promised to revolutionize the way we think of interacting with user generated worlds.It simply does not deliver this experience. While many of the creature and building creation tools are fun and interesting the game play is very lackluster. Most systems are highly repetitive and there is little reward past the creature stage for any well planned evolution of your creature. You're hyper carnivore can easily become a tree-hugging hippie in tribal with no consequences, nor do you have any advantage at combat. The same is true for the reverse situation.Very simply, it feel like the stunning revolution we were promised is a world stunningly empty of content. There is no good AI to creatures you share worlds with, no rich ecosystems develop. It feel like a combination of free internet flash games tied together by innovations in procedural animation techniques.This is simply unfortunate.
3640	Terrible product: Sennheiser makes good things, but not this one. Sound is okay, but they are stiff and TOO TIGHT. Oh, my Gosh, my hat size is only 7-1/8.I returned it.
3641	Does not last long!: I bought this hot air brush at KMart, its the only one they have with a larger size barrel. This is the third one I bought in a less than a 2 year period. I use it daily, and it gives great results. However, it does not last more than 4-6 months. The point at which it breaks each and every time is where 2 flimsy screws are attached to the barrel. I am now looking here at Amazon to find a different brand, for when my current airbrush breaks I will not buy another Revlon one. If it wasn't for the barrel breaking off so soon after purchase I'd give it 5 stars.
3642	Is Strieber obsessed with lesbian aliens?: Though initially The Last Vampire grabbed my attention, it devolved quickly (as do most of Striber's books) into an inane example of what a generally good writer produces when out of fresh ideas. It seems that Mr. Strieber has been out of fresh ideas ever since he switched gears from the original Hunger and Wolfen by switching to the alien themes of Communion et al. He allows this theme to slip ino The Last Vampire in minute threads throughout. This, intertwined with his emphasis on Lesbian sex (which was done well in the movie version of The Hunger) gives The Last Vampire an unorganized read.
3643	Although a classic a group, the CD: OVERATED!!: First and foremost I must be in agreement with the beats. Initially, if the beat does not grab me, I am reluctant to listen to the words. After listening to all the hype about this CD and discovering I only enjoy one song and an interlude, I was quite disappointed. The CD reminds me of a mix tape similar to a Sound Bombing composition, although Sound Bombing II, the new release, is five stars better.
3644	Drago Menacing As Ever in "Convict": Actor Billy Drago (Deadly Heros, Freeway) has been making movies since the 80's. He is type-casted as a subtle psychotic killer with unique behaviors that he has made his signature. For fans, he is a guaranteed good time in the bizarre behavior department. He remains true to his craft in "Convict 762". The movie has good casting, Frank Zagarino (Never Say Die) and Shannon Sturges (Tornado!), who use their air time well in this deadly game of cat-and-mouse. There's good action in this low-budget sci-fi thriller and it keeps the viewer entertained and wondering what's what. This movie is worth the time and a must have for Mr. Drago fans and sci-fi lovers.
3645	Everything You Need To Know: Everything you need to know to day trade.Digital Day Trading defines exactly what is necessary to be a profitable day trader and then shows you how to do it effectively.The price charts and Tradecast screens and interviews further explains what needs to get done.Very clear presentation,no fluff.
3646	YIKES! Headless dancers!: I guess I should have caught on to the play on words in the title - "Hip to Toe". I am a dance instructor looking for new ideas for my preschool and elementary dancers. This is NOT what I hoped for by any stretch of the imagination! The description claims this is an "Award Winning Rhyming Sensation" - how misleading! My children were NOT entranced with this strange combination of headless dancers tapping and twirling to spoken nursery rhymes. We were all quite turned off by the sheer weirdness of the whole presentation. YIKES! I would obviously not recommend this DVD to anyone in the "real" world looking for children's entertainment or training materials but it may have some "artistic" value for those whose tastes run to the "artsy" and unique.
3647	Didn't finish: I have never read a Jodi Picoult book before, but this one came highly recommended by a co-worker and a book club member, so I took it on vacation with me. I stopped reading this half way - I just couldn't take it once Jack got arrested again. Too predictable, too weird, too boring. The Hawthorn rip off was just so obvious. I thought I might pick it up again to finish it, but there are just too many other good books out there.
3648	As raw as they come...: Georgia's best kept secret,Tinsley Ellis,can easily stand alongside Clapton or Gary Moore.This 1994 offering represents the fruits of a live in the studio recording with a band that decided to strip down to the essentials:smoking guitar licks and a tight rhytm section.Featuring Derek Trucks as a guest,this album is so good that it might actually be true!
3649	Good movie, CD is bad...: It Plays, however, sounds terrible in the drive and does not down load so I can not copy it to my Ipod. Movie was good.....
3650	Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn: As a stay @ home Dad, my wife told me this might be something I could relate to. But not--the world of minivans, swanky subdivisions,is the last thing I can relate to.
3651	A well-remembered favorite: My daughters both enjoy reading science fiction. While discussing The Hunger Games, I told them about Starman's Son. Although I had forgotten a lot of the details or perhaps didn't understand them fully as a young teen, I do recall it being one my favorite books. I am anxious to read it again and share it with kids.
3652	It works: Not as well as a prescript but it's safer too. It's the same ingredient in green tea without the caffiene.
3653	focus!: One of the tricks to be successful in any endeavor is, no matter how much you learn, to keep abreast of the basics.This dissertation provides contemporary insight, common-sense, and interesting experiential examples to make some poignant points about making money in the music industry.Find a quiet moment, or slip this disc into your car CD player during rush hour traffic, and listen!Keep your music career in sharp focus!
3654	Sea Wolf: I thought there was wonderful character development. London made me feel as if I actually knew the people as well as he did. He used fantastic visual imagery and if I closed my eyes I could see the action take place. He used many sailing terms I was unfamiliar with and to more thoroughly enjoy the book I would suggest any reader brush up on sailing vocabulary and parts of a sailing vessel.
3655	entertaining: I purchase these for all my friends with new babies. The babies love to watch the rainbow but better than that I had purchased it for my cats. They get lots of exercise on sunny days, chasing the rainbows around the house. It keeps my old and my fat cats moving. This is great even I am not home to play with them.
3656	Great Starter Doll: I bought this for a great-niece who is too young to play with it yet, but after reading other reviews, I do think she will become attached to Baby Stella. She's soft and cuddly and her older brother even thought she was neat!
3657	The best movie that I have ever seen!: This movie keeps you guessing until the very end. After I first saw it, this movie became my new all time favorite. It's definately a must see
3658	Hawaii Low Budget DVD: I was truely disappointed with this DVD. The production is very low budget! Announcer is not a professional, has a wierd voiced and does not read the script smoothly. The video quality is poor. The script is extremely simple and but it does have acceptable information. It's kind of like a high school video production. Just an overall disappointment.
3659	Why Didn't I Read These Reviews First?: I bought this stupid thing thinking the price and description indicated a good safe investment. I hung it on the wall near my computer. Occasionally it would wake me up in the middle of the night for no reason at all. I don't know if it was self-testing or just defective. I tried to get to it quick enough to figure out what the "voice" was saying, but I could never get to it in time. Today it went off and so did I. I smashed it to smitherines and threw it in the garbage. First Alert? Never again!
3660	Classis East Side Kids move.: This is in reference to the Alpha Video version.This is a classic east side kid's move where the kids help out the poor little rich boy who gets himself in a jamb. If you like the East side kids, like I do, you'll like this movie. The DVD and sound quality are terrible. You can barely see the picture at some points and the sound is scratchy to say the least. It appears it was just copied from the old films. I guess you can't expect too much for the price. There is a re-mastered copy of this video by Digiview Productions so make sure you buy that version. I haven't seen it yet but it has to be better than this one.
3661	Nice Idea - Bad Product: Really sounded like a great gift for my wine lover and gadget oriented friends. Boy was I disappointed. The user interface is awful - very primitive and difficult to use (lots of scrolling through wines vs going to right to what you're looking for). I am really glad that I bought one for my husband as well and saw how bad this product is.. allowed me to apologize profusely to my friends.
3662	a weakly contrived "movie plot".: this book was totally disjointed. the concept was sound,but from the beginning the characters were sadly two-dimensional.also it seems like Green couldnt make up his mind. and kept changing their personality to suit his poor story,which would have better fit into a hollywood movie of the ridiculous"batman & robin" vein
3663	product not good.: Picture is bad so is the sound,it is recorded by a single camera that moves up and down which may damage your eyes. Its not worth selling it.
3664	Security Mail box is junk!: The top door is very hard to open. It is so had to open that the screws that secure it to the 4x4 post will pull out of the plastic back of the mail box in no time at all. The entire top of the box flexes when the door is being opened. The locking mechanism doesn't work either. The key can be inserted and turned, but when it is locked, the key can't be removed. Not much good this way. Save your money and buy something better.
3665	Truly wonderful in scale: I'm so glad I bought this; although it's expensive and hard to come by, I am pleased to finally have a copy of Blake's complete pictorial works. Of course I also bought a copy of his complete written works. If you are a lover of Blake's work and strive to understand him fully, this is a must-have.
3666	Not worth it: I had this watch for about 5 weeks, hardly wore it as I was keeping it for a nice watch. when I put it on for the third time, I turned out the post to reset the date and the post came off in my hand. I cannot set the watch, use the watch or even wear it now since both the time and date are wrong. I requested a warranty service and they said sure. pay to send it here, wait a minimum of 90 days and please include a check or money order for $28.00 to send it back! What a rip-off. I'm going to save a ferw hundred more and get a REAL swiss watch. Don't waiste your money on this crap.
3667	A MUST HAVE: If I was forced to give up all my cds except one this may be the keeper. I like all of Red Riders and Tom Cochrane's music but this one stands out. All the songs on Neruda fit so well together and all the songs are great especially" Nepolian Sheds His Skin".Give it a try.
3668	Hard to find, found: Glad I was able to score a real copy of this record before CD's become a part of history. No Aimee Mann collection is complete without it.
3669	You're too dumb for this movie, and so was I: This film was long, tedious, overwrought with baseless emotion, etc, etc.I would have rather been doing laundry then wasting my life watching Melancholia. You've been warned.
3670	The book is one sided: I was required to read this book for college. I was excited about the book until I realized how one sided it is. It mainly talks about problems african americans have. Doesn't talk about native americans, asian americans, or hispanic americans much. It also isn't politically correct. They call different culture groups native americans, asian americans, hispanic americans, african americans and white. Although sometimes it states european americans instead but the authors should have stated european americans from the begining since they did for the rest of the ethnic groups. It was also one sided on the role of women. It made it seem like growing up to be a "girl" was a bad thing and a stay at home mom should feel bad because she's not in school. In my opinion, this book is one sided, biased and a waste of time. I am reading the 8th edition and cannot believe it got this far.
3671	The Worst Puzzle Game Ever!!!!: In this game, all you do is line up the colors and clear blocks using the color you, a triangle, have at the current time. If the blocks get to the square you are in, the game ends. Another thing that gets me is that this game lacks a 2-Player Mode. Do not even bother with this game.
3672	The Poorest 2 Hour Adaptation of a Sci Fi Novel: I read this book recently while traveling - like most Stephen King novels, the book holds the reader's attention - with sufficient descriptions, narratives and character development. Unfortunately, this adaptation significantly deviates from the story's plot, is not a true representation of how the tale is told in King's novel. In fact, there are several scenes that are not representative of anything in the novel and the distortion of a solid sci fi/horror story is very disappointing. If you've read the book I'm sure that you'll find yourself numerous times wanting to turn off the movie and retain your fond memories of a good read.
3673	This man is a reliable source? PLEASE.: Mr. Kaplan used to go around with an old suitcase on which there was a piece of silver duct tape, on which he had written "Vampirologist". In it he carried a mallet and a wooden stake just in case he had to kill any vampires. He started a "Vampire Research" institute. He was a true believer in the Amityville story and tried to convince the Lutzes and another researcher to become involved in a book deal with him so he could cash in on the story. When his overtures were rebuffed by the Lutzes he decided to do anything he could to get even and became a critic. A VERY UNRELIABLE critic. And we are supposed to put any value at all in anything he says? PLEASE.
3674	Great: Used movies are a great way to surprise my college student. She is the envy of all in her dorm. The used movies are a great CHEAP package to mail to surprise her that I never have to leave home for! No scratches worked great! Arrived promptly and would recommend seller.
3675	the best drivers: Expensive? Yes.But these drivers are extremely comfortable and precise. And the color coded labels on the back will save you countless hours searching for the right screwdriver (not really, but it is a surprisingly helpful feature).Given the number of times you use a screwdriver, you might as well get the best. And these are the best.
3676	Could not use it.: Took over a month to get here and when I got it I could not use it because it wasn't for my region. So after paying for it and waiting so long in the end I couldn't even use it!!
3677	Excellent for small batches: This pot works great for small batch canning. I am able to fit about 7 half pint jars in it. I have also used it with my canning discovery basket (which holds three pint jars). Overall, a great purchase!
3678	A dreamlike atmosphere that incites a childs imagination.: The last time I saw this adaption of Alice in Wonderland I was 10 years old. However, I saw plenty of movies in my childhood and none stands out as haunting as this version of Alice in Wonderland. Its hazy dreamlike atmosphere thrilled me as a boy and any version I saw afterwards was a grave disappointment --especially Disney's which came out about 20 years before. I still remember this film very much and was excited to see it again only this time I noticed things that were very adultlike. The music added to this film's charm and itself was very erie but beneficial to the story. I must say that there will never be a movie that comes close to his book like this one did.
3679	Great game and it's successor: This is a great game, especially since it was released 5 years ago. It still holds it's own as one of the best space games ever. (By the way, I noticed a few reviews mentioning technical difficulties. Be sure to download the game software update from the Homeworld 2 website on the support page.) If you want a game centered around space based combat and commanding fleets of ships without a bunch of cartoonish junk, this is your game.For those who already have this, or have been searching for a newer, more advanced and complex game of this type, check out EVE-Online. That game is so elaborate you could literally step into another life in a vast universe with everything from different professions, economies, wars, corporations, politics, commerce, governments, and a vast universe of over 5,000 systems, each with planets, space stations, and more to visit. It's the ultimate evolution of sci-fi space games.
3680	Overly complicated, and finicky: I'm not sure if it's Windows Vista or these specific headphones, but the process to connect to the computer is convoluted and hardly ever works. The sound quality is soft, frazzled, and spotty, There's a constant *beep* every 5 seconds I could not get rid of no matter how they were used, and the range seemed to be only about 10 feet before it got too fuzzy to listen to. $50 Down the drain. Better spent buying extra long extension for regular headphones.There has to be a better way than bluetooth.
3681	Froggies steering my car...what could be better?: Last summer I received several matching froggy car interior items as gifts. They have all held up very well! I have this steering wheel cover, the seat covers, floor-mats and the little trash bag.I liked them so much I bought my daughter the cute monkeys seat covers for her car. They are adorable and she loves them.These products are durable and fun. I would recommend them highly.
3682	dont be fooled by the title: Honestly, I received it. I opened it once. I never looked at it again.A boring little book that really didnt help me in any way.I'm sorry I purchased it.
3683	Whirlpool PUR filter: There's not a whole lot to say - I need a new filter every 6 months or so and this is the model required for my fridge. The water tastes fine after being filtered. There is definitely still mineral left as I get a lot of scale/build up on spout on the fridge, but our water is very hard.
3684	Great indoor chopper: The blade cx2 is a great helicopter for beginners. It is easy to learn how to fly and is very responsive to control inputs while still maintaining stability. I also bought the sh-60 seahawk body which looks realistic and doesn't affect performance. I would also buy extra blades because you are bound to break them sometime. This is a great chopper.
3685	Microsoft Groovy Mouse not so Groovy: While I find most aspects of this mouse great my complaint is primarily aimed toward the scroll wheel middle click button. It is maddening to use since the wheel seems to be so sensitive. When you go to middle-click anything the wheel moves and your target link moves away. While this is very frustrating the rest of the mouse functions are great. I use Mozilla Firefox with tabs and a middle-click is very important to me. If you are looking for just a regular wireless mouse that looks great then this is it. However if a middle-click button is important to you find another choice.
3686	Save your money: If you want a good gazeteer for the world of Greyhawk, buy the Living Greyhawk Gazeteer. This is good as a refresher, or if yo just need the map. It's size means the info on everything is limited. Very brief writeups on the various countries and factions don't have enough meat to make your own campaigns off of unless you're looking to make the Greyhawk world your own creation. But if that's the case, why aren't you creating your own world instead of buying an official one? Save the money and buy the Living GreyHawk book. It has more to it and is more worth the money.
3687	Don't buy unless you don't intend to use!: I purchased this item 30 days ago at a local store. After using it half a dozen times for smoothies (something a 550 watt motor should easily be able to handle) the motor stopped working. I exchanged it at the store feeling that I had just received a defective product. I used the new one 1 time...the motor died. Ridiculous. Needless to say, I returned it for a full refund. I won't be buying a black & decker blender ever again!
3688	Quality good, size too small, size specification incorrect: I was planning to put my laptop under this monitor stand (in its docking station with lid closed) to free up desk space.My laptop is 13.75 inches wide. The description says the monitor stand is 16.3 x 12.6 inches, but actual dimensions are 15.7 x 11.7 inches. When assembled, space between the legs under there is 11.65 inches -- not wide enough to fit a laptop unless it's small.Construction is sturdy; fit and finish are acceptable. Assembly is easy. My complaint is the misleading size specification.
3689	Gates 20613 Lower Radiator Hose: Perfect fit for my 1969 Lincoln Continental. Direct factory fit, molded hose. Most places try to sell you the flextube which does not work in the tight quarters on a stock lincoln. The only way to go. Does not include the inner spring though, save the old one and reuse.
3690	don't believe the hype: Two scenes: a murder, and a rape. Yes they both are really graphic, but it's not what turned me off. I just found the movie to be extremely boring. It's well made, well acted (dupontel was fine, vincent cassel was good, as usual). But my god...after the rape scene I had the urge to fast forward the movie. The film is flat, offers nothing interresting. I don't see what Gaspar Noe was trying to show. It all looks like a very nice marketing experiment. Don't believe the hype...
3691	Best product we know of: We have a tried a number of products to clean and polish our hardwood floors, but Bruce is easily the best. It gets up most grime and leaves a nice finish. This half gallon refill is a terrific bargain, at least when selling at half off as it was in May 2012.
3692	I took him up on his offer to call -- very disappointing.: I took Hicks up on his offer to speak with him on the telephone. I was impressed that he would actually make his telephone number available, and would answer it himself. I had called to discuss one of his "kits". In a very amicable manner I asked Mr. Hicks for some way that I could verify his claims. Instead of responding helpfully, he said "I'll still eat tonight if you don't buy my information". He treated me like a dolt. Needless to say, I did NOT purchase anything more from him.
3693	Fantastic book!!!: I teach school and I use this book in the classroom. It is wonderful. It is a multi-layered book that even states that it is in the beginning of the story by comparing the storyteller's story to a wall that the storyteller's father tears down only to find something beneath. The figurative language is wonderful. I would highly recommend this story to anyone that is looking for a good book to read that really makes you think. Young and old alike.
3694	Don't waste your time and money: The learning curve when you find out you and/or your family is gluten sensitive is steep. I wasted valuable time trying to eek information from this chatty waste of paper. The tiny amount of information buried under the self-important personal dribble is out of date. Gluten-Free Diet: A Comprehensive Resource Guide, by Shelley Case, a dietitian, is a much better use of time.
3695	Derivative with subtle homophobia: It isn't even that much of the elements have been done before by better writers. Or that the few original ideas don't logically track. It's that the author runs a subtle but nonetheless disturbing homophobia through all three novels.(Every time there's any hint whatsoever of some ambiguous character, this person is always repugnant) And yet she seems to have no problems whatsoever with rampant incest. Disturbing.
3696	8 months old & already problems!: We purchased this camcorder in October of 2003, and by June 2004 the pause button has already quit working. We have only had light to moderate use of this camcorder since purchasing it. It is still covered under the one year warranty, but we have to ship it all the way to California from Arkansas (and yes we have to pay for the shipping and handling), and it will not be back before our vacation. They will not cover it unless it is shipped to them. I would think twice before purchasing this product.
3697	If I'd wanted to read Dumas, I'd have read Dumas: I had to put the book down after a couple of chapters. Some people are saying "homage", I think a more appropriate word is plagarism. I think the idea of a 'novel' is that it should be new. This book really insults the reader and what's worse, it sucked compared to Dumas' Three Muskateers.Unoriginal, insulting, insipid lack of imagination. Plagarism.
3698	A Highly Revealing Book: I had a chance to come across this book while looking online for "Passion of Christ" by Mel Gibson. I watched the movie, and it was an interesting story. However, I was, and still am, amazed by the information revealed in this book. I had the first reading of this book, over 500 pages, in a couple of days. It was really hot! The information was so intense that I am going over the second, more thoughtful reading.In my humble opinion, this book, surprising little known so far, offers to everybody a new perspective for our relations with God. It is true that such a perspective is very challenging and it takes some time for people to fully understand it. How could it be different for a new groundbreaking theory. "Confessions..." is a must for everybody who perceives herself as a free-thinker and is searching her own soul. I highly recommend this book for reading by everybody with an interest on spiritual issues.
3699	Better even than I expected: This set wasn't high on my priority list, but I finally picked it up on sale from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised. The shows definitely show their age, but the stories were better than I'd expected. Ron Harper and James Naughton worked well together, although I think their comedic banter at the start of many episodes went a bit too far. Roddy McDowell was great as always as Galen. Lots a great guest stars from other 60s and 70s shows appeared, including Mark Lenard, Royal Dano, William Smith, Marc Singer, John Hoyt, Jacqueline Scott, Geoff Deuel, John Lormer, John McLiam, Michael Strong, Morgan Woodward, Beverly Garland, Harry Townes, Joseph Ruskin, and Sondra Locke.When I had finished watching all 14 episodes, I was truly sorry to have no more to look forward to. It's a shame the series didn't get the chance to play longer and give us a conclusion.If you're a Sci-Fi fan or fan of 70s-era television, then I'd highly recommend this enjoyable, but short-lived show.
3700	Truth about War: Although I was never "in country," I was in the USN during the Viet Nam Conflict.I made two cruises to the South China Sea aboard the USS Ranger CVA-61, Aircraft Carrier.I also had friends that were killed and friends that were injured in Viet Nam.If you are willing to know the truth about war, including Viet Nam, watch this.
3701	The phone is nice but AT&T service is bad: AT&T wireless as a company is not prepare to service any customer. Please try their customer support line before ordering the phone. You will be on hold for hours and at the same time the department that handles your number porting is different from the ordering derpartment which is also different from normal customer service. If there is any issue, there is no single point of help so you will end up waiting hours on hold.The phone is nice but don't get the service from AT&T. The provider is bad.
3702	A coloring book for grown-up as well: I have always loved this book and was delighted to find this color yourself version for me to color. I may also purchasre one for my grandson. This is fun for all ages!
3703	Way too much, unless you are a expert: Wow, what a book about preaching. The book is long, detailed, and yes tedious. I was warned before hand concerning the book, thanks Matt, of the nature of the discussion. Buttrick is a master, there is no doubt. He knows every thing and every one concerning preaching. This book is not for the average preacher, most would have no clue what he is talking about, it is mostly theory. This book is beyond me, I am not that good yet to practice this methodology. But the book was helpful in polishing the pulpit. The book is like fine sandpaper, it puts on a beautiful finish on a preacher, but you have to be polished before the paper would do the job. If you are a top notch preacher that needs the most challenging material and style, this book is for you. If not, read "Preaching" by Calvin Miller this year.
3704	Jaw Droppingly Amazing!: I really don't know how you can accurately descirbe something so flawless and do it justice at the same time. from start to finish this c.d. does not fail to keep you sucked in and does not let you go until that annoying couple seconds where you actually have to come back from your mind-trip and press play again. The melodies, harmonies created here are quite possibly the best to be put to a record in the last decade. Absolutely amazing! And yes...the vocals, the vocals are sooooo awe-inspiring. Maynard NEVER ceases to amaze me with his amazingly powerful yet, hauntingly beautiful voice. Just when i think he couldn't do any better, he comes along and outdoes his previous performance, be it TooL or APC. This IS the Album of the Year! But, dont take my word for it, find out for yourself.
3705	A great story of recovery: The story of Johnny Cash's life is as tough as it is inspiring. Immense artistic talent mixed with shyness and a desire to make up for past faults, all within the context of the rise of rock and roll, makes Cash's a story like no other, except for perhaps that of Elvis. His friendship and eventual love for June Carter stabilized the internal chaos that fame and fortune brought him.
3706	The tape does no justice to Bharatnatyam: In my opinion, the tape does no justice to Bharatnatyam. This tape is good for those who have no knowledge about Bharatnatyam. It is a complete spam. The chollkutt(speech) is very poor and the words are mispronounced. I am not sure which style of Bharatnatyam it follows. The dancer's face has no expression or shows no enthusiasm. The dress attire of the dancer too doesn't follow any regime. The dancer's movements are not energetic. (...)
3707	Where's the doll that was supposed to come with the book?: I like the book but I'm disappointed that I did not get the doll. Not that I don't mind making my own doll but it would have been nice if the seller could have mentioned that there was no doll included with the book. That would have been a little more honest. I'll probably try to get the doll and book from another seller but I'm not sure I'll be buying from this one seller again.
3708	Great tool!: I've had two of these bit holders for over ten years and never had the cap "fall off" It is a great tool. The single compartment storage area holds seven bits. The cap is a friction fit that is easy to thumb-off and press on, no unscrewing or lining up any holes. It's a simple, great design.
3709	Do NOT buy this....you will be sorry, I was: Even the tech support people could not figure out how to get this to work. I was on the phone with them for 1 1/2 hours ( they were very nice). They admitted that I was not the only person to have a hard time with the installation of the drivers...then the soft ware...then getting the pad to work. Eventually, the tech guy just gave up...said he would have to ask an engineer (!!!!).When the tech support people can't make it work ( and tell you they are swamped with calls from other frustrated users)....you know there is something wrong.There are lots of other good options out there....so save your money and your sanity, and go with something else.
3710	Not representative of the movie; a big disappointment.: To run a four-hour miniseries and then offer a cd which is supposed to adequately represent the mini series, should require a two-disc set of the major music from that movie. This collection does not fill that bill. Some of the music on this cd is only there to satisfy certain demographics and does not do justice to the miniseries...nor to the period it pretends to represent. What a huge disappointment; it could have been so much more... Obviously, somebody just wanted to make a buck and didn't care about the people who count the most: the customers.
3711	bliss encoded: i love this record. love. that's a big word. if you like harmonies that saturate your soul and melodies that you cannot forget (you will humming them forever) then just buy this. the instrumentation, the lyrics, the phrasing are brilliant. belle & sebastian fans know this already. let's update the ones who don't. this is modern-retro 60's pop, scottish pub, drinking-song alternative folk-rock that smart college kids dig and their 'simon & garfunkel' parents will dig, too.if this is your first Belle & Sebastian record, trust me, you will buy more after this.the snappiest numbers: "if she wants me", "i'm a cuckoo", & "wrapped up in books". but they're all golden, really.
3712	Wonderfully endearing story!: Michael Christie has written a wonderfully endearing story of a shy little reindeer named Olive. Olive is like many of us in that even though she is constantly doing her best, and getting better and stronger every day, inside she still feels like a nobody, and wonders if she would ever be chosen for such an important job as pulling Santa's sleigh. This is a very uplifting story about how Olive finally comes to discover her dreams at the North Pole. Even though this book is written on a 9-12 yr old reading level, the little ones simply love having it read to them over and over. My 2-year-old constantly wants someone to read it to her, and my 11-year-old is usually the one who does. It's the kind of book that MUST read EVERY night at bedtime for months(or so your child will tell you.) This is definitely a 5 star book...a new classic in our house! You won't be disappointed with this one.
3713	Did not work: These did not work, model listed for our fridge. Had to return, sent same model the second time. Also charged a 20% restocking fee. Not happy that these cost $11 for nothing.
3714	Ok, I am interested, to a point....: A new Gay show. After QAF, I needed something to fill the void...This episode caught my attention. But the episode is a little raw and needs to be "spiked" up a little. I was slightly disappointed. The characters were briefly introduced and the story line was limited. I gave it 4 stars because even though this episode is raw, I feel it has potential. In my opinion, they have my attention with the plot. But the story line is a little weak. I think they need to introduce the characters more.Will I get more episodes, most likely. Even though this first episode was weak, I would like to find out what happens....Its not for the QAF fans though. This show is different. Definitely a work in progress.
3715	Where's the movie?: This is quite an amazing story. Surprising it hasn't already been made into a movie, but in this day and age, this is probably a good thing. Thanks for putting it all down on paper!
3716	Excellent for the price: The sound quality is good but not great ("fuzziness" audible), and the microphone isn't all it could be, and the comfort is also good but not great.
3717	ahhhh!!!: it was my birthday, and my parents gave a game boy advance, i was totally happy, until i began to playdit was dark to the bone i only could play under a super brilliant lightmy advice is dont you buy it, the game boy color its much better...
3718	Mediocre and Pretentious: Read Henry Miller and Louis Ferdinand Celine instead if you want to experience what a really good work of art looks and feels like.Fante try's but he rarely gets off the ground. The best part of the book is his description of life working at the cannery.This seems to me one of those first or second books an artist might write which he thinks is terific but looking back 10 years later realizes it is a "work of youth" and "badly flawed" if he is honest with himself.
3719	great product and is holding up well: I got this cover in mid july of 2010 when I got my new ford truck. After a year and a half, I wanted to post to the amazon consumers that the product is holding up great. Went together easy and has held up in all the weather climates you can think of. The adjustment of the fit is easy. I like the driver side, inside the cover latch release. If you have a locking tailgate, this is really nice because you can only unroll the cover by releasing the latch from inside the bed with the tail gate down, so it adds a bit more security than snap style covers.Material is made of very good quality. I have owned cheaper covers with silly snaps that wont unsnap in cold weather and poor top material and I will never go back to that after having this cover. Do yourself a favor and spend the little extra cash and go for this tonneau cover. You will be very happy!
3720	Warning: This movie is NOT what it claims to be: This movie hyped itself to feature the efforts of the Navajo indians during WWII and the usage of their language as code. Less than 10% of this movie is actually about the Navajo indians' contribution to the Pacific War effort and mostly about the Nicolas Cage character and his problems. I was very disappointed.
3721	Brings me back to my childhood!: Gosh, I use to love Clifford and all of his stories. This one particularly is my favorite. I am so glad that it is finally in a board book so my daughter can enjoy it with out it being destroyed before her brother or sister comes around. The pictures are very colorful and the book is very sturdy.
3722	Not Compatible with Win7: This was an awesome WiFi card with Windows XP. There is no way to use with Windows 7. Shame on Cisco/Linksys! Any other reputable big name company would have made the effort to support their customers. No driver means no support.
3723	Haven't burned a cookie yet...: I am always burning cookies and ruining cookie sheets, but with this, I can't! Cleans easily, stores easily and saves money because you don't have to waste all that parchment paper.
3724	"Anonymous" isn't the writer he used to be...: The book itself is worthless outside of North Dakota, where arecent shortage of bathroom tissue was reported, but what reallybothered me was the scandal surrounding the author's identity. Does anyone care who Joe Klein is? Of all the writers who put out works of "fiction" in the last five years, isn't it safe to say that Joe Klein does not rank in the top ninety-nine percent? I mean, it's one thing to cover your back against lawsuits by writing a "no-names-mentioned" roman-a-clef, but to do that and then slap "Anonymous" on the cover...that's like ringing your neighbor's doorbell and then, instead of running, beating yourself up so you could say a mugger did it. Kind of defeats the joke. No offense, Mr. Klein, but you should try assertiveness training.
3725	rugged shell, weak guts: Like a turtle it's invulnerable as long as the head is retracted. But the USB prong cracked right off after a month of use... and not hard use. Junk. And is loaded with some of the more annoying software too...
3726	Very good: This book does an above average job of covering various aspects of trading. Short of perfection, as if there is such a book, it does cover basically all aspects of trading. If I were looking to get into trading or investigating how to start this is where I would begin. I don't think that it's anything new for most accomplished or experienced traders but they would still learn something new from it.
3727	"Secret Honor" - best kept secret in Nixon films!: Philip Baker Hall's performance as Richard Milhous Nixon rates as my favorite among Nixon films. His portrayal of Nixon covers all the bases, from quiet obedience to his beloved mother to the snarling, foul mouthed paranoiac we've all come to love (or hate). The film is riveting as Hall's Nixon drags the audience deeper and deeper into his harsh world view and finally brings us to the very edge of his despair. The end will have you laughing, cringing or both. Brings into sharp relief the concept that we are all heroes in our own mind, and it will make you wonder what sort of spirit dwells in the leaders we currently elect if a man this twisted with hate, self loathing and paranoia could be elected president twice. Just an amazing film. Even if you don't subscribe to Hall's portrayal as reality you can't deny that this a talented and powerful performance. This film should be a must have among the "conspiracy" minded.
3728	Wonderful Birthday Gift: This was a birthday gift for my father--he loves John Rutter's music and he loved this. He was very happy to receive this CD and we played it many times when I was there for Christmas and we all enjoyed listening to it.
3729	Great guide: Wonderful product for hiking, walking with the family and for our main purpose, hunting. Tracks nicely. Great viewing options. Has tons of memory and sooooooo easy to use. Great for all ages. You have to have one if you walk in the woods at all. Just love it!
3730	Advertised as a Six-Pack but Ships as a Single Can: Pretty simple - the picture and description indicate you are buying a six-pack, but only one can shows up in the package. RETURNED!
3731	Superman, Spiderman, Batman in one. Should have rented not purchased this movie: What I haven noticed is that HR exploits his son's looks in his movies. Not bad looking but not the best in Bollywood. This movie is okay at the beginning, but then turns boring watching him smiling and posing and showing off his body and hair. Tooo long of a movie. This movie is a combination of Superman, Batman, Spiderman and The Black Mask. Don't know why I purchased this movie, should have rented.
3732	Finally a technical work the layman can read and understand: Having read a lot of popular material re: the Battle of the Little Bighorm it was with a mix of interest and apprehension I started on thisone. And what a surprise it was ... no technical lingo, and where it was used adequate explanations were included. There is a balance between the unfurling of historical events, what was discovered about them and how it enhances our insight of what may have happened. The book narrows-down many of the options while at the same time creates newones. The reader expecting the ultimate answers will be dissappointed. Reads like a novel excepts a few parts where fire-arms and types of ammunition are discussed. Not to be missed by Custer-buffs and people interested in popular archaeology. Too bad many drawings are included of the survey-activities on the battlefield and not actual photo-evidence.
3733	Greens can change your life!: Victoria gives great information on why we need dark leafy greens in our diet, and a very palatable way to "drink" them. I've been drinking green smoothies for over a year, and they make me feel so great! I also went on a 1 week retreat where all we had to eat/drink was green smoothies and fresh fruit, and wow! what a transformation. I also recommend all of the Boutenko books, 12 steps, cook books, etc.I am now in the process of transitioning to an all raw vegan diet. There are many health benefits, and this book is the best introduction. Victoria really does her research! Enjoy....
3734	Works good make sure you open a window: So far we found this product be very effective for its advertised use. The only downside and I'm sure this is unavoidable is the fumes that it puts off when in use. Now I don't know much about the chemicals but I do know that for a general film cleaner we have switched to a product that we have to pick up locally because it can't be shipped because of its flammability. Interestingly we found this product we picked up locally did not have the harsh fumes of the one we used to get shipped to us. I know this is a review but it makes me wonder if chemicals are added to some of these cleaning compounds so that they can be shipped state to state. And if those chemicals are in fact the ones that add such a harsh aroma. So in closing just note that you'll need to use this product in an extremely well ventilated area. Otherwise we found this product to be extremely effective for its advertised use.
3735	celiacs beware!! Contains wheat.: I checked the ingredients before I bought this product. However, they do not list them all, because this product contains wheat, which I cannot use because I am a celiac. Unfortunately, I put it on my skin before I decided to double check the ingredients. Ugh!!!!!
3736	Overrated. Tripe.: Very bad example of character comedy. The jokes fall short and seem very standard. Its not awful, but don't pick it up or add it to your collection.
3737	Under the hood: good book. very good storyline to follow from start to finish...shows the strength of the writers and animators...would recommend highly..
3738	BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!: I love this movie so much, It may be old, but it has such a great story line, it so real, and It can't be touched with a 100 foot pole. It is a beauty. LOVE IT!
3739	Died in less than a week.: Wouldn't buy this again. Lasted less than a week before dying on me. Amazon informs me I need to put at least twenty words into this review, so OK, it was shorter than one week before it died. Maybe that's clear and long enough.
3740	Nice: I recently bought this for my floor tom, it sounds decent in comparison with my older one that came with my drum kit, the only problem is that scratching becomes visible after 4 weeks of playing, and had to replace the lower drumhead for some Evans G2 clear for it to sound good
3741	Cute toys and concept, but "non-existant" customer service: We have been waiting over 2 months for username approval. No rejections or responses of any type from Shing Stars moderators. You need username approval to do certain things on the site (like have buddies, which is a "BIG" thing most of the kids want!)The only way to contact them is through e-mail form on their site, 90% of the time you get a canned response. It took me 3 e-mails to even get a response from them (and guess what- they answer they gave implied it was a canned response or did not read the entire e-mail).Stick with Web Kinz! At least there is plent of FAQ's on their site (something else Shining Stars has very little of)It's not very compatiable with FireFox either.
3742	Not very happy!!: Well, my daughter wanted this doll so bad , and if you don't say the exact phrases loud or clear enough she will not respond to your chid correctly. I also noticed while my daughter would feed her with the spoon provided or brush her teeth with the dolls tooth brush, this was making the painted lips on the doll come off (peeling off).In my opinion not safe. This doll made my daughter (who wanted this doll in the worse way) so upset and frustrated that the doll sat on the floor until I returned her.Too bad she was cute!
3743	Much Loved Toy: My 6 year old has been playing with Imaginext since he was 4 and he loves it. He has never had a problem reconfiguring it or getting it to stay together. Everytime a new item comes out he wants it. My 3 year old even loves playing with it. I think the sets are very durable as well. In the 2 years he's had it, we haven't had a piece break yet and he plays with it a lot.I recommend this for any parent that has a child who enjoys building and pretend play.
3744	Excellent book.: After my puppy getting sick for the first time, I was in a rush to get a medical book or two to have on hand. This was an excellent choice. It has so many topics.
3745	So Far So Good: I haven't used it very consistently yet, but what few I have taken seemed to have stopped my hair breakage and that took only about one month. In a few more months I will update my review.
3746	Ricky Martin Unplugged: I returned this product to you as it was all in Spainish. It wasn't asvertized as so. All other purchases I've made from you get 5 Stars! I'm a very satisfied customer.
3747	Dave Weckl is the man!: To all you drummers out there that need a new direction in their playing, this for me goes beyond your expectations. I've never even thought about playing in odd time let alone in 5/8, 7/8 and 9. He breaks it down and shows you the easier way to feel and count it. Also he has his solos and playing with trax. He also talks about "backwards" playing and playing dead on the down and going around the groove. You have to watch this in order to really appreciate this great video. If you are new to Dave or already know what he's all about tackle this one.
3748	great for the price!!!!: we bought some tablets for our grand daughters at christmas and they had no charging cables. we checked and they wanted $12.00 for each cable. checked amazon and of course they had these for $1.65 each. how did i live this long, without amazon!!!!
3749	Disappointed: Black& Decker DCM2500 SmartBrew 12-Cup CoffeemakerAfter much research, I purchased this Consumer Reports highly rated Best Buy 6 weeks ago. While it makes a great cup of coffee, the carafe leaks. It seems to be coming from the area where the plastic handle/spout component joins the glass. I have attempted to resolve this with Black and Decker, only to find out that they have sold this product line to Applica. Attempts to contact Applica reroute me back to the Black and Decker web page where I started. I give up.
3750	Panama Canal: We loved this DVD. We took a Panama Canal cruise after viewing. Recommend both the video and the cruise through the canal.
3751	Shankar lacks empathy: A 2 because one of the first lines state "this book is selfcontained for someone with no knowledge of the subject and blah blah blah it should be readable and easy" this book is mightly confusing and rather boring. Shankar's style is akin to trying to give someone directions in a totally strange land to a unknown place by waving their hands in the air and telling you which way to go. This type of thing may be fine if you're speaking to someone who knows the land--a professor of the subject maybe, but is flirting with confussion for a student. A 2 simpling because this might be a great book--once you know the subject.
3752	nothing at ALL compared to suicide notes: but I gave it two stars for the "right side of the bed" track.nevada's grace isn't so bad, either.still though, the worst song on suicide notes is better than the best song on this CD.
3753	Sold it back...: This was a required text for a Computer Science II class at Baylor University. The book was hard to follow, and there are not enough coding examples. I sold it back to the bookstore, taking a lose as usual.
3754	Great Remote: Easy to program, easy to change setup, worked with all my electronics... even an older surround sound system. My wife even liked it once I showed her how easy it was to turn everything ON or OFF using only one remote. Program it once and you are done.... unless you want to change something or add pics or background pics.
3755	Nostalgic: This is a great album, but with some songs performed by generic singers. I'm glad they eventually included at least David and Shirley. This brings back great memories of when I was 9. There is not much more to say other than get it if you like nostalgia and have fond memories of this genre.
3756	PLEASANTLY SURPRISED: This set will comfortably sit side-by-side with links sold at high-end retailers (that sell for - seriously - 20 times more).Product exactly as pictured/represented. Ditto for the presentation box (were you planning a gift; Yeah, I'll take a pair :)
3757	Awesome: I looked at it and said - 1028 pages! No way I was going to finish a book like that, definately not with my record (7 months to finish 'Midnight's Children') Boy was I wrong; awesome...I would say one of the best books I have read. I actually felt like like I was part of the story and at one time did not want the book to finish! Folett has a way of keeping readers continuosly interested in the story, never boring and absolutely unpredictable, a lot of general knowledge about construction (and all very logical as well), and not difficult to keep track of characters as it is pretty difficult to forget the important ones. All together a wonderful read.
3758	Another classic by Nimzowitsch: Not as good as my system but still one of the best ever. This is a good match with my system.
3759	The Big Book of Recipies for Babies, Toddlers & Children: Not only were the recipies far from user friendly, I do not know of many babies or toddlers who would enjoy them. I was hoping to find some basic recipies but these were for a more developed palate than that of a child.
3760	Don't Waste Your Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Works great when first purchased. Will last about 3 months under normal use and then the beater brushes will quit working. Its a poor design. Very loud and hard to push
3761	Expensive, but worth it: No spills, looks great, and absolutely does not leak when locked. It's my daily partner on the morning commute. It's expensive, but worth every dime. This is the only cup I allow myself to drink coffee from around my son (he's 18 months). So, for safety, as well as for not ruining shirts, it's a good investment.
3762	Beautiful Creation: Shakespeare in Love is a wonderful story line of what may have happened in the genius playwright William Shakespeare's life as he penned many of his plays and sonnets. The movie is historically accurate as far as the time frame goes and even parallels what was happening with Shakespeare's contemporaries during this era. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I would highly recommend it, especially to Shakespeare fans.
3763	causes trouble: This drive has ended up being more trouble than it's worth. It' works ok *most* of the time, but when I was on XP the drive would randomly suddenly pretend to windows that it has no files (easily gets you scared). Disconnecting the drive and reconnecting it fixes temporaly. Also sometimes the harddisk never sleeps, and stays spinning at a high-rate all the time, unless unplugged from the machine.I recently upgraded to a new vista machine, and hoped that the issues with the drive would cease, but now I just get blue-screens complaining about usb or ieee power management. I've definitely pinned this down to the drive, as i never get this issue with it plugged in.All in all, I recommend staying away from this drive. As soon as I can I'll be buying a replacement and copying all my data from this drive to the new one, as I no longer trust this drive holding my data.
3764	Thanks for the warning!: Amazon: If you sell a version that has been altered from the original, you MUST make that clear in the listing! It is not enough to mark the individual discs deep in the fine print.I didn't pick up on the format problem until I glanced at the forum. I would not hesitate to return the package and demand a refund if I had ordered this thing by mistake. Thanks, all, for saving me the aggravationLet's get this straight. I won't buy ANY full-frame edition (unless the original is 4:3) because I really hate the idea of some schmuck panning the frame and superimposing his/her sensibility over the director's. And the Shrek films are totally professional, not throw-away kiddie drivel. They deserve some respect.
3765	Best vacuum for everyday life: I initially purchased this vacuum for my tanning bed repair and maintenance business. It cleaned the tanning beds extremely well including the lampholders and the ballasts. I use it every single day for the floor, furniture and curtains. I'm eager to purchase another for the second floor.
3766	Disappointing: This book is essentially an expansion on several newspaper columns related to the thriving Japanese automakers and the struggling "Big 3". I expected to gain insight into management systems and perhaps a comparison of the methods used at various automakers to understand why honda and toyota continue to gain market share and impress their customers. Instead, the book uses quotes from sources like Edmunds and company literature to demonstrate the writer's point and really tells very little about how these companies work.
3767	Amazing!: I have given away dozens of these books. I read it every day for two years an I was blessed and encouraged. It spoke to me just what I needed to hear almost every day.
3768	Worst Book in the Series: I read the book and I still couldn't figure out what the "Gamble" was that Wedge took. When Stackpole takes X-wing pilots out of the cockpit and tries to turn them into commandos, this book really slows down. I really hate a book that doesn't resolve even one detail of the plot. This is a continuation of what is really just 1 long book that doesn't end until book 3.
3769	CLAY AIKEN ROCKS!: I bought this cd along with clay aiken's single Solitaire last week. He has voice of an angel and I love how articulate he is when he sings with such passion from his heart and soul. WOW don't miss this one, he is awesome.
3770	TERRIBLE AND FACTUALLY INCORRECT!: In pursuit of factually correct accounts of our western history? Stay away from this poorly executed, and factually dishonest DVD. There is absolutely nothing burned on this disc that is correct or well done! Waste of time and money!!!
3771	Great treat dispenser: I thought the kibble would come out too fast since the hole is kind of big and has no rim inside but it doesnt. My pugs really enjoy this toy. I prefer it over the buster cube because the cube is really loud on hardwood floors. While this plastic is harder than the vinyl toy buddies ball, it's preferred for us over the buster cube. Would recommend.
3772	Don't get it: If you like old fashion movies this is for you but it really isn't that good in my opinon this was a waste of money.
3773	Not so good: I loved the Pamela's "simplebites" cookies but these organic expresso chocolate chunk cookies, which sounded good in the product description, just tasted plain weird to me. The texture is right but the cookies have an off taste, a little like rancid butter. I like these flavors together--coffee and chocolate--but not in these cookies.
3774	Butternut squash and apple soup recipe is awesome!: I feel like I shouldn't be giving this a star rating since I don't actually own the book, but I've read most of it. My mom has the book and I copied out the butternut squash and apple soup recipe. It is delicious! I don't have dinner parties but I make it for myself as an everyday meal. I'm just out of college and always trying to find things that taste good, are easy/quick, inexpensive, and healthy, though usually I have to sacrifice one or more for the others. This recipe tastes amazing, one of my favorite foods, and is also really easy. Since it's made from apples, onions, and squash, it's healthy, relatively inexpensive, and the ingredients stay good longer than most fresh fruits and vegetables (I always have trouble with fruits, vegetables, herbs, etc. going bad before I make my dish).My mom also makes the beef tenderloin (filet mignon?)- though not with the sauce; it's our favorite thing for Christmas.
3775	The quality of these books is aweful: No, I'm not referring to Tolkien (of course!). The reading content is fantastic. However, I recommend you not buy the boxed set printed by Houghton Mifflin. I've only read my copies twice and the pages are already falling out of the spine. These are put together very badly. Pay a little more and buy the hardcover if you plan on re-reading (and you will, trust me).
3776	Nothing is working but the calendar and phonebook: Looking forward to this 700w for quite sometimes. Sad thing is Verizon wants too much money out of your pocket and make nothing working on the unit for you. You have EVDO services and cannot use it as a bluetooth modem for your laptop internet access. You go buy the wifi card that doesn't work with any internet voip applicaiton or corporate PEAP-GTC network because it's asking for a personal certicate (no..root certificate wont work). You claim the rebate too fast. So you are stuck with the phone. What is good? My son likes the bubble pop game I guess that's the good part of it....and i use it to check the date and time. Man...what a time waste and a shame to have a product made with so many limitation. I think RIMM will take care of the corporate messaging world easily.
3777	I Don't like this book much: This book does serve for a decent reference for seeing how to use code, but the theory is nonexistent. It basically says here is some code and this is what its doing. There are very few paragraphs that are not explaining code. It doesn't tell why to do things nor what is and isn't bad code. Other reviewers were right when they called this book bizarre. To the books benefit I did learn quit a bit from reading it. If you have object programming experience or are familiar with object programming "JavaScript The Definitive Guide" from O'Reilly publishing is a much better book.
3778	Excellent work: I've been a mild Zevon fan for years, but not a full-fledged groupie. This is an excellent CD. Get's better each time I listen to it. Some songs are "kick-ass" (Disorder in the House), Some are touching (Please Stay, Keep me in your heart). Overall, a very satisfying collection that is ultimately uplifting. The many guest artists are a welcome addition to the production.
3779	I love the illustrations in the New Catholic Picture Bible: I read this book as a child, and I remember loving the illustrations. My children enjoy it just as much, and there are even some new stories and illustrations in this version that i had not seen before.
3780	Richard Scarry-a family favorite!: My son loves when we read him this book. Granted, he's only 7 months old but there is so much fun stuff to look at. Richard Scarry is a definite family favorite for us!
3781	great product: I am over 60 yrs. old and love this product. I ordered a 100 ft electrical cord,( do wish this product was gas powered) It is limited, but it does the job quickly and is quieter than other vac/blowers of this type/.
3782	Hot Dog Toaster: I bought this as a gift for a boy who really likes hot dogs. It does not cook the dogs very well at all. You have to cook the dogs 3 or 4 times then put in the buns to make it work. I think his parents took it to the goodwill.
3783	Not helpful: I just came back from Myanmar. This guidebook is hopelessly outdated in regard to practical information. It is at least 10 years behind on current conditions which are constantly changing. The only useful information is concerning sightseeing but even that is inaccurate. The problem is that there is no other current guidebook in print.For hotels use the internet directrooms.com, asiarooms.com or asiahotels.com.
3784	director of commercial real estate: excellent magazine for earning ability of commercial real estate and how to extract fair value by the efficient management of commercial property.
3785	Great easy-to-make recipes!: The recipes in this book don't require that you purchase expensive, hard-to-find ingredients. I bought this book because I have never made my own skin/hair care or bath and body products, so I wanted to start with recipes that a novice could make successfully. I was not disappointed! The first recipe I tried, grape seed lotion, turned out great! I will be making many more body care products using the recipes in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about trying to make their own beauty products at home but doesn't know where to start. The author provides a description of the ingredients and equipment she uses which I found very useful. I was able to find the ingredients I needed at my local co-op, but any health food store should stock them or you can find them online. You should be able to buy beeswax from your local beekeeper. I now feel confident that I can make my own products at home, thanks to this book.
3786	Waste of paper: Making meaningful sense out of the content of this book is impossibily hard. It's like a lot of info in a garbage can. Authors did not even try to sort it or clarify things. I borrowed BCRN book from a friend. Easy to read, eveything is in place. It looks like Sybex's only successfull CISCO book is CCNA course.
3787	For your mom, maybe!: This book has failed to define anything useful for me. It has very few terms for the number of pages, and the two sentence long definitions seem to be written for people outside of the computer industry. Not helpful at all.
3788	Not worth the money!: I recommend not even looking at this book! It only solves the problems that are in red in the text book and usually there is only 5 or so! Don't waste your money or time!
3789	Great product!: Well built and works as expected! The rubber housing for the gauge is a nice touch. Good price for a very must have tool.
3790	GRRREEEEAAATT: love them, wwear them all the time, great for working out, if u have any doubts, dont hesitate, and buy
3791	Much worse than the previous 4 seasons: Why do so many people seem to call this the "best DW season yet"? Compared to the previous 4 series, this one is very, very poor. The scripts are boring and childish; Gillan and Smith make a very poor team - they mumble and have very intolerable accents in addition to displaying very limited and amateurish acting skills; the sound, video, and special effects are dull and repetitive; and the overall seasonal plotline lacks any coherence or follow-through.I give this season 2 stars, only for making a feeble effort to keep the series alive. Hopefully, things will get better or die gracefully.
3792	do not buy this product! It is far worse than my English writting. Thats how bad it is!!: I have never ever wasted my money on a porduct as bad as this dvd.Its a bunch of bull from the beginning to the end... no scientific facts or arguments just a 50 year old lady telling stories like.. if your upper lip is fat then you like to share youre feelings, while if you have a slim upper lip... than you like to be left alone! and this kind of bull will go on for 50 minutes.It is far worse than my English writting. Thats how bad it is!!
3793	2 stars: Frances Pierce, as one of Anne Boleyn's lady's maids, has a unique perspective on the conflict that brought her mistress to power, and then to her fall. Even as Anne comes into favor, then begins to fall from it when she fails to bear Henry a son, Frances' own fortunes wax and wane. Often driven to tears by the capricious royal moods, Frances suffers the good as ill with as much grace as possible. Even her own marriage lies under the cloud of the court.** It is difficult to define a true plotline in this story. Frances does provide a different sort of look at one of the most infamous love affairs of history. However, her own story is somewhat distracting from the more interesting royal one. **Amanda Killgore
3794	Handy Gadget: Using a walker makes carrying things very difficult. My father-in-law has found this basket very handy. It doesn't fit perfectly on his walker, but it works well enough. The basket is very sturdy. Overall, a very good product.
3795	Does not work: We have had nothing but trouble with our computer and phone line since we got the catch-a-call. When it was hooked up, our connection speed was only 12 kps - 24 kps. It took FOREVER to get on line or surf the web. We unhooked it from our modem and now we get connection speeds of up to 56 kps, but now our phone's answering system doesn't work and it then rings into the computer instead of the answering maching picking up. It's frustrating and it makes me hate dialup. But not being able to afford broadband or Road Runner, we are kind of stuck.
3796	Super fun, but not too educational: Ty Girlz is obviously for girls, which reduces the chances of it getting as many friends, although there are male fans...me...but thats only becasue it's fun. It's very customizable and the games are fun, even more fun than Webkinz most of the time. The only problem is that it isn't too educational. They do have some games that make you think, but where it lacks in education, it has creativity and imagination, which is just as useful as education. The only other probelm is that it sometimes doesn't show stuff and freezes, but it comes back if you restart it (mostly games).
3797	A GREAT BOOK TO READ: I really enjoyed this book. The book provided lots of information for the consumer. You can not find this information elsewhere.
3798	Great: Buy this for yourself and anyone else you know who loves great music. In a perfect world this would go platinum. It's just incredibly good.
3799	Great sound at a great price: impressive sound in a small speaker.The "housing" look real enough and the price was great
3800	A Great Book!: This book is a magnificent book. It is a great story about friendship. It also has enough adventure to keep you excited and you want to get farther into it.This is surely one of my favorite books.
3801	Too Wordy: This book was a little TOO wordy for my taste. I am sure to ALL the FANS of the Hick's absolutely love it, however I did not. That's just my opinion. I am off to the next book. I prefer something that is straight to the point and less fluff, if you will.
3802	a must-have for climbing in SD: Bought it used as it's out of print but it was in great condition. It's a must-have if you don't want to carry around a bunch of loose sheets. If you don't want to buy the book though, you should know that all the topos are available at: [....]I just like having an actual book to bring along.
3803	Awesome kitchen organizer, on a budget: I intalled these in "all" my undercounter storage and they are great. Install took about fifteen minutes each using only a pencil, tape measure, square, and cordless driver and drill = simple and quick.Makes it super easy to store, organize, and access all my cook and bake wear, cleaning supplies, and various odds and ends. I have been using them for over a year and have had no problems at all. Every slider is packed full and works smoothely. My gear is mostly smaller, and light to medium duty, so this is perfect for me.I suspect that heavy kitchen equipment, in larger installations, might work better with HD ball-bearing sliders - BUT they were four to six times more expensive than these ClosetMaid kits.
3804	Well written.: I have very little use for Klingon "culture", or most of what they call "values". So it amazes me more than a little that I can actually enjoy a book written about Klingons, featuring almost nothing but Klingons, and lionizing their culture, attitudes and behaviors. I suppose that some of that is due to the fact that almost the only "value" that Klingons and I share is honor, and this book focuses on the lengths to which an honorable Klingon will go to defend that honor. But while I did enjoy reading this book, I can't in good conscience recommend it for anyone who isn't a fan of Klingons.
3805	Very Cute !!!: I bought this as a gift and when I open the box, the Razor Pocket Mod (Hello Kitty) looks exactly what the picture, it runs very smoothly, my mother just in love with any Hello Kitty products...
3806	Simply Dastardly: Nursery Rhymes with a sadists twist? How dreadfully delightful! If you are warped carry on and buy this book....if you are looking for a happy ending...go elsewhere.
3807	'TIS THE SEASON FOR SOUPS AND STEWS: Nothing tastes better on a blustery winter's day than a steaming bowl of homemade soup or stew. And, nothing is better to prepare it in than this All-Clad Stockpot.It seems that a stockpot is one kitchen item that never wears out, so I'd been making do with what we had. But, when I was fortunate enough to be gifted with this stockpot from All-Clad I couldn't believe the difference!It has a thick conductive base that spreads the heat evenly, not just where the burner might hit it. And, it has solid stainless steel walls that keep the heat in. The lid fits snugly, and it simmers away for hours emitting the most delicious aromas.The brushed exterior gives it a great look, and it is made to conform to All-Clad's estimable high standards. Soup's on!
3808	oh hell yeah: this is an awsome CD! it starts off good with a killer Undertaker theme. thats the best song! other greats include the rocks song, stone colds song, and the brood. plus, it has another one of the all time greatest songs.... DUDE LOVE!!!!
3809	Does a good job but a little dull: I have to have someone sharpen the end of it for me so that I could get underneath the staples I was trying to remove from a covered seat for a chair. It worked great once I did that, but the ends appeared to be a little thick at first.
3810	Nothing impressive here. What's all the hype about?: This book is nothing more than a self-help manual adapted to the Christian audience. His use of paraphrase versions of the Bible is annoying beyond words. Also, why do I feel like the book is being used as a catalog for the "Purpose Driven Life" merchandise collection? Score one for commercialized, warm and fuzzy pop Christianity. Perhaps Christians and churches will find their "purpose" easier if they stop chasing every trendy book and video franchise that comes along.
3811	That's good: My computer is not as hot as it was, I like it. The only thing that I don't like it is that the fan is a little bit noisy. Overall, it's good for me.
3812	Product good, delivery not so good: Installed the fan two days ago. This product replaced cheap box store fan installed in our bedroom. The fan is worth every penny and then some. However, it took much longer than the vendor stated the delivery would take. The product is great so far, the vendor's delivery was not so great.
3813	Stalk-Forrest Group, a.k.a......?: Gee, it sounds a lot like Blue Oyster Cult to me. And that's a good thing.
3814	Hoya 52mm HMC UV Digital Multi-Coated Slim Frame Glass Filter: Product was exactly as described and worked beautifully. There was no problem with lens cleaning prior to fit-up aand had no marks or other prints etc on the lens. The Nikon lens cap fits correctly and securely.
3815	Good Gator: I purchased this product in April 2008. It continues to float very good. The material that ties the sections together is still holding but the gator itself is showing some wear. I think it has held up very good considering that it has been in the pond floating for two years without ever being taken out.
3816	I Returned Mine: The countdown timer has a maximum of 60 minutes. How silly. The power meter is hard to read. Also, why did they waste space on the display with the year? Who needs that?Not me.
3817	Mean and Bitter Tone Throughout: Before reading this book, I was extremely cautious to avoid any information/review which might spoil and prejudice my opinion. In that I was successful.It had been a while since reading the other four books, so they were not on my mind and in fact I worried about forgetting minor plot points and whether that would affect my enjoyment.I needn't have worried. There was nothing enjoyable about Mostly Harmless. I was overwhelmed by a sense of bitterness coming from the prose, found myself wondering, "Does he even *like* these characters?"It struck me as the work of a man who hated what he was doing and wanted to kill it in the most complete and irrevocable way possible.Two stars for occassional flashes of the non-bitter Adams.
3818	Too much time invested in pumping it up.: I took the pool out of the box, saw all the work needed to pump it up, put it back in the box, and returned it. Honestly, I couldn't figure out how to pinch the air holes. I had to pinch them to get air in with the pump. Maybe I didn't have the right tools. Who knows. But I ended up buying a snap pool which holds practically the same amount of water. No pumping, no deflating.
3819	good value: very impressed with the qulity for the price,i have paid more for watches with half the qulity.would recommend invicta watches and Amazon service!
3820	Disappointed: I had very high hopes for this book but was very let down. The stories were boring and drawn out. I'll stick with David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs.
3821	*A MENUDO FAN'S 'MUST HAVE' CD*: If you ever, ever loved the sound, the memories of "MENUDO", you must treat yourself and anyone else with this wonderful 2-CD package. Adios,Juanita
3822	Blue Emu: Product was not helpful in pain relief. Perhaps the addition of lidocaine would have better. I would not recommend this product to friends.
3823	Buggy Examples: Why do I have to give this even 1 star? The early examples in the book didn't work, so I put it down and never went back to it.
3824	No Beer Information: As a book that has the title "... Bartender's Handbook" you might expect it to have some information about beer. I understand it's a cocktail book. That's fine. In addition to spirits, it does have quite a bit of basic information about wine, but absolutely nothing about beer. I mean nothing... at all. Of course beer is a large subject (as is wine) and there are many books to delve into the topic. It just strikes me that if you're going to include wine, you would include beer. I think it's a grave omission.
3825	enjoy the classics: Deana Martin brings us back to the days when music was at its best. If you love Dean Martin, you will also love his daughter.
3826	Good Desk Top Sound: Ideal for a small computer desk. Good Sound quality, and also works well to plug in you IPOD outside.
3827	SAVE YOUR MONEY: Wow, I'm so glad I borrowed a copy of my friend's before i went out and bought this piece of garbage DVD. Don't buy Toology, it's a complete disgrace to the band!
3828	Looking for action? Don't look here.: If you can not stand to read an extremely slow-moving, supposed-to-be-emotional book, this is not for you. Borland struggles to keep his audience interested, and loses, if you ask me. Overall, not a book worth reading.
3829	The little pin keeps falling out: I got pretty frustrated trying to take my own measurements using this tape measure before recently starting a diet. The little pin that holds the end of the tape fell out at least 3-4 times for each measurement I tried to take, even when I thought I was holding everything perfectly level. I really wanted to like this gadget but I was like, "Come on, how hard can this be? Make the pin lock or something!"Anyway, I got the measurements I needed and will measure myself again in a month or so. And, more than likely, no matter how careful I am, the pin will probably fall out 3-4 times before I get each measurement. Which is fine, but annoying.
3830	complete loss. While removing disc from the case it broke into three pieces.: While removing the disc from its case it broke into three pieces. So...no view or review. Complete loss to me.
3831	good product: this product is much better than others, believe or not, I bought three brands with similar product but this one keeps warm longer and the quality of material is much better. happy with this product.
3832	Li-ion makes the difference: On my 4th year of owning this Impact and love it. The NiMH batteries are starting to die on me. Downside is the replacement batteries cost 40-120 dollars for these, but it will use the Li-on batery as well.Mine is the older version with the Ni-Mh, but had to put a review here too. Awesome impact flat tire on my 3/4 ton truck, 8-lugs, a breeze with this impact. Bought another Hitachi Hammer Drill with Li-ion battery and hate to use my Ni-Mh the weight difference is out of this world...
3833	My mom loved it!: I got this for my mom. It was her b-day. She went to a 50's valentine party. I never saw the outfit, but she said it was made well and it was really comfortable. She won first prize for best costume.
3834	Ripped Off: This situation goes back to September 2010!! THIS PURCHASE DEMANDS A SUBZERO PRODUCT RATING.The 12 Gillette Fusion Blades were copies not made by Gillette. DULL AS A HOE!! When I contacted Amazon I was told that the money that I paid would be refunded and a new cartridge of GILLETTE blades would be sent. (Email Documentation is available..) As of this date none of the promises has been met.Be careful about your purchases!!!I'm through with Amazon.-- Don --
3835	Good for rental: I rented this on Amazon Prime for our granddaughter. She loved it, but has not asked for it since, so I guess I would say that it's a good choice for the 48 hour rental, but not necessarily to buy (hence the 4, not 5 stars).
3836	Cullmann Quick-release Plates: The quick-release plates listed are cmpact enough to leave on the camera. They aren't sturdy enough for large or very heavy equipment but for quick and easy use on 35mm and digital cameras they are ideal especially when used on the Cullmann Magic II tripod as do I.
3837	Error 99 and shutter problems are serious: I got a new 10D a few month ago. It just failed. I have not taken more than 500 pictures. I used only one lens Canon EF 24-70/2.8L. Today the shutter failed. One leaf of the shutter could not get back into place. So the camera shows "ERROR 99" and is no longer useful. Search on google will see so many posts on this problem. The shutter life is very short. Do not buy 10D until the problem resolved, or you will regret. I am surprised that no one addressed this here.
3838	Best Beatle album of all.: The Beatles White Album is one of the best albums of all time,Johns voice on Dear Prudence , Julia, is worth the money alone.This album stands out today as it did in 1968. To all Beatle fans and new ones , this is a must have for your collection..Rick Anderson.
3839	The last track of the gravy train: I, like so many who have stuck with this series past book 6, am only in it to know how it ends. Knife of Dreams, the 11th book in this strange journey of Robert Jordan, brings me no closer to the state of serenity that (after book 9) I feel I've rightly earned. To that end, I closed the book and asked myself what it was that kept me reading this trash, book after book, wasting countless amounts of currency just to keep abreast of the hemorrhaging plotlines. Was it the random paragraphs of detailed description about a culutre that Jordan kills off in one chapter? Was it the obsessively repetitive passages devouted to the spanking of Egwene al'Vere? Or was it some sick, twisted hope inside of me that somehow Rand al'Thor would keel over dead and Mat Cauthron would ditch princess Toun and go back to the dicing and womanizing that made him likeable to me in the first place?None of the above. I just want this series over.
3840	The WORST Magazine: I started reading this magazine because i needed something to read, but I stopped right away. Thr articles are pointless, because you can buy another magazine and see the same information, and same with the pictures. The editors of this magazine put exclamation points basically after every single sentence, none of which were exciting at all. Maybe i just hate Pop Star! just because i don't care for celebrity magazines. Or maybe not. But the only people I would recommend this magazine to is children under 10 years of age.
3841	I just didnt care for it that much: I am a huge Ian Tyson fan and have been lucky enough to see him in Jackson Hole in the 90's. I just didnt care for this album that much.
3842	Not for me: I like mystery, but I guess I don't care for a most of the modern writers. I enjoy a mystery that stands on it's own as a good mystery. Guess I'm tired of sifting through all the new best sellers to find something. Throw out the sex and drugs and everthing that goes with it in this book and and you are left with.......Pete
3843	Love them: These glasses are great. Definitely very thin arms but shape and fit are great. You shouldn't really do anything dirty or rough in them. I got the gold ones and my only complaint is that theyre not super gold, they almost look silver in the dim light.
3844	Don't waste your money: Norton old password manager worked much better. It is a pain to use especially if you use the same password for serveral different websites. After using it for a couple of weeks, most of the time not working properly, the final straw was that it suddenly stopped recognizing my Infovault password. Several emails to Norton and nothing but worthless repsonses. Hours wasted trying to get help from their website! Even when I just wanted to know if I unstalled the product would password manager still work, no response.
3845	Wow!: I walked into this novel thinking that it would be an utter waste of my time, since I had to read it for summer AP English work. Having finished it, I've realized that I was completly wrong. This book was amazing! So many words of praise come to mind when I think of this novel. It placed me in the center of a bitter-sweet experience that not only affects the lives of the characters but also that of the reader. The Poisonwood Bible was touching in every sense of the word and it was definitely worth the hours I put into reading it. Kingsolver's characters were believeable and extremely well-developed. The plot was unique and intriguing and I found it virtually impossible to put down. The beauty and majesty of this novel are hard for me to express, after having found myself drowning in such words and such a story. I am exceedingly pleased that Oprah has placed it on her Book Club list for June and I would whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone. Enjoy this mesmerizingly wondeful experience!
3846	Not what they were meant for.: I got these for a reason outside of what they were meant for. I made a firetruck loft bed for my son this year and I needed lights. I put christmas lights through the frame and covered them with these as red lenses. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect solution! When the lights are on it is amazingly awesome!
3847	Excellent flavor, love the reusable tins: This tea has an excellent flavor and I reuse the tins by buying larger quantities in bulk and storing in the tins. I have a "tea station" on my counter with a tin of this and a tin of the English Breakfast always at hand. A note to those of you who prefer your tea iced...use this with a coffee filter in your iced tea maker or through sieve and you won't be disappointed!
3848	I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT!: Books that don't deliver the promised cure but instead will fool you to the end. I am looking into this book to find cure and can't find it. I just keep reading the words as I presume it is leading me closer to get what I need. No, it doesn't come. Is just like another book, maybe by Suzane Sumers-people may think they will find cancer cure but NO. The book that comes to my mind that delivered is God's Medicine Is Best by L. Wise and another by a Russian author I can't remember the title at the moment.
3849	WHAT IS THIS: This was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. It is a disgrace to the first one which is hilarious. I urge you to please save your money and buy the first one. This movie should be erased from cinema and the director and producers should be fired. The laughs were funny if you are 4. In part one it was smart comedy. I bet the Farrely brothers are embarresed. 110% horrible
3850	There are better books for tea parties and intro to teas: This book is geared for, and would be appropriately aimed at, young pre-schoolers who enjoy tea parties, coloring books, and simple hand drawn images. It would be good for young girls who would be interested in hosting Teddy Bear tea parties in their room. Images are in black and white, with a brief explanation of the picture below.It is not a comprehensive guide for tea and tea parties, but rather a hard back version of a coloring book. As such, if you are looking for something to add to a gift basket for a youngster this would be something to seek. But if you are looking at a guide to teach youngsters about tea or tea parties in general, there are other books that would be better choices. There is not much to this one other than roughly drawn images of a girl at a teddy bear tea, with drawings of things the author wishes to explain.
3851	not worth the trouble: I was all gunho about getting this cd,ready to start working on getting a flatter belly but he did more talking and advertising his other products,kind of like all talk and no go! very disappointed, and since I played the cd if I were to return it I would only get 50% refund! So buyer be ware!
3852	Puhleeze: The first book in the trilogy was fine, other than it's remarkable similarity to the Julia Roberts movie "sleeping with the enemy", it was an enjoyable read. This book was just stupid. The plot just kind of meandered on until the completely unbelievable, and almost science fiction climax. And who exactly was the villain in this book? Roberts couldn't seem to make up her mind. Was it the crazy x-husband? Looked like it until you realize he was possessed by something. Was it the fame hungry reporter? Again, kinda looked like it, woops he's possesed too. But by what or who? That answer was really never given. Angry that I even wasted my time with such a stupid read. Nora Roberts, you have just lost a fan.
3853	Unbelievable flag!: Just received this flag after only 3 days! Quality is unbelievable! double thickness, fully embroidered vibrant colors. Absolutely blew me away! As a former Marine I was absolutely stoked when I took it out of the package and went outside in my shirt and tie and hung it up ASAP! My wife just shook her head, but by now she should be used to my motivated and enthusiastic nature. Buy this, you will not regret it. May God bless and keep our military safe! Semper Fidelis!
3854	Pitiful Attitude Of Black Males Dominering White Women: Thought it was so sad! Women lowering their standards for a cheap peek at what white men do and dont have.VERY DEGRADING I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THESE GIRLS-REAL WOMEN WOULD KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. TIME DOES MAKE A WOMEN WISE.SHE CAN USUALLY SEE HER ERRORS AFTER ITS TOO LATE OR BY THE TIME SHE'S 30.I HAVE BEEN THERE.
3855	Lonliness and redemption: I went through a real phase of reading nearly everything Douglas Coupland wrote a few years back and this is one of his better books. The story centres around the life of a lonely woman who hasn't met mr right or even mr you'll do yet. Her days are spent at work and she returns home to her lonely apartment for evenings with the television and her cat. Needless to say things change for her and life becomes more complex but i don't want to spoil it for you. What i like about Douglas Coupland's books is that he sees the ugliness of modern life but allows for the possibility of hope, redemption and a sort of happy ending. He is almost spiritual in a way although not in a bible bashing sense. If you enjoy stories about lives changed and hope for meaning in life then i strongly recommend Douglas Coupland, this book is a good start.
3856	Trash: Wish I could get my money back.Trash mouth Language dumb plot.Miss leading advertisement.Would never recommend it to anyone.
3857	Underrated: This movie is seriously underrated. As a resident of Oakland, CA when the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred, I was somewhat right in the middle of the real event, so I think I can safely revue the realism aspect of this movie. Well acted, well written and entertaining, this movie acurately portrays the real events of Oct. 17, 1989 well enough to bring flashbacks to those of us who lived this real life tragedy. If you haven't seen this movie yet, give it a try, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
3858	Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006 Anniversary Ed.: Great software! Not as advanced as Photoshop, but gets the job done. Easy to use and making dvd slideshows with photostory 3 has never been easier. I bought Digital Image Suite 9 and I liked it so much I upgraded to the newest edition. A++++
3859	I love to snoogle with my snoogle: The snoogle is pretty good. It's better than the full-body pillow I bought first; but of course it was also 5x the price. The main complaint I have about the snoogle is that it doesn't breath as well as it could so, being 8 months pregnant in June, snoogling can be a little too warm. It's not awful though, like I said - it's better than the first pillow I tried. At $50 it's somewhat overpriced, but if it helps you sleep it would be worth it and I do think it's worth a try. I use mine alot for naps and about 50% of the time for sleeping at night. Another potential problem is the size - my husband hates the snoogle b/c it takes up alot of room in our queen-sized bed; not a major issue, but I thought I'd mention it.
3860	Very good product for the price you pay!: I have owned this saucepan for more than one year. The quality of the pan is very good. I own other brand name stainless steel cookware, but to my surprise this one holds its own quality.The pan conducts the heat very effectively.Besides, to my surprise, it cleans very easily.Finally, the size of the pan is also good. It can be used for various occasions. I used it boiling pasta and veggies, quick sauteing spinach, and even deep frying meet. It all performs very well.The only design issue I have is the top of the lid and handle. It would be perfect if they use all stainless steel for the lid and the handle.I highly recommend this pan. Very good quality for the price you pay.
3861	What the...?: The first time that i heard this song, I said: What the hell is this, its awful, the only thing good is the voice of christina, and even that I think about it, personally, I think that she's trying so hard to make a good song, the result, a confusing and non-melodic song, Poor girl, I saw the charts and the song only peak 48, with a good reason, Britney will always be the best, no matter what.
3862	Not my cup of horror: I'm a big ole fan of Wilson's Repairman Jack novels, but vampires stories turn me off. I think that sub-genre has been way over done. I gave this one a try anyway, but this one's just not my cup of horror. I can see it appealing to those readers that can't get enuf vampires, but I'm gonna read Wilson's other work.
3863	Don't Buy: It's a total waste of money. First the stick broke (within first weeks of purchase), then the battery weakened (about 5 mins of charge after only 6 months of purchase). Sad thing is I would have paid more money for this product if it worked as it should have.
3864	jenthink and it's affects on you: Kathleen's hounding after Erin was really totally scary for me, and sooooooo real. I really got into this book right away, tho I dont usually read a whole lot I found it really interesting and pretty good. Because he told the truth about my life, and probably yours too in fact I think the guys a psycic and should have his own show totally or else it would be areal waste and a bummer. And the sex schenes where so real, the giggling and jiggling and laughs and tears and joy and sadness all mixed up together. Totally heavey. I only wish that there had been a beach scene or one in the mountains in a cabin would have been awesone, cuz I know that happens to alot of other people too. But anyways definatley five stars all the way.
3865	JR review: I had a problem with the first collection and I sent it back and exchanged it. This was done in a very timely manner.Great job and service.
3866	what Chinese crap !!!!: I did not even have a chance to use it... I thought that I had better test it out before a camping trip in spring, (thanks to the boy scout up-bringing, "be prepared") so I hooked it up... it leaked right away, not out of the valves, but out of the poorly constructed shaft... so back to the individual gas canisters... what a rip-off... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP !!!!
3867	The author should have started wrapping it up around page 45...: The author hooked me and raised my expectations during the first 30 pages or so. And then the pitch started about the importance of storytelling above all else. At some point along the way I imagined the author (or someone else buying into this book's premise) speaking in stories to people. Who would take such a person seriously? What about judgement and mixing it up? There's time to be direct and there are times to be indirect. One arrow for all is one gross oversimplification.
3868	Disappointing Resource: This book will be most useful for fundamentalists who wonder about the contradictions in the Bible if it is read literally.
3869	Not the Original English Dub Version: I love, love, love the original English dub but this will do. The dialog is just a tiny bit different from the original but I didn't want to spend $60 for it. If you are a true die-hard fan of the original, you might be disappointed.
3870	awesome purchase: I am all about TaeBo but wanted to add something a little different to my workout program. So I bought this dvd and Cardio Overdrive (also by Alison Davis). Alison combines several dance styles that are fun and really make you work your body. The first time I tried the dvd I was so caught up in the moves that when the 45 minute workout was over I couldn't believe that much time had passed. But I was sweating and could feel I had a good workout. I'm a good dancer but some of the moves are a little confusing- don't let that discourage you. Alison instructs you to make the move your own so you don't have to do it exactly the same. Plus one of her workout assistants does the low impact version of the workout that you can follow. For me not conquering all the moves made me want to go back to the dvd to try again the next week, so it's a challenge.
3871	Wow.....: I own all of oteps other albums, and at one time I owned this one too. The song warhead is absolutely great. And house of secrets has it's good points too. HOWEVER, this could be the most depressing album I have ever listened to in my entire life. It put me in such a bad mood that i actually had to sell it. I liked Sevas Tra and I love the new one, ascension. This one could go down as one of my least favorite albums. Just way too depressing.
3872	young holmes- - very cute!: I think that this was a really good movie, I think that it kinda explains why homes really never fell in love in the future. and I think that Holmes is really cute!
3873	good: Not the best utensil organizer but it does hold all of our cutlery. the mesh designs allows for debris to go past it so debris doesn't pile up in it like most other utensil organizers.
3874	Awful lens: Spend your money an buy a better lens than this one. Was slow, unresponsive and I switch it out after taking 2 pictures at a wedding. You get what you pay for people.
3875	good for homework: A good book to give to cleints as home work, but I would not suggest doing it on your own w/out support.
3876	Tiny Euroface: It's quite a nice product, but is really small for a standar room. I'll have to buy a bigger bulb.
3877	Red Flag: The only song that I really liked on this album was Red Flag. I heard the song on a late night show and thought that it would be a more punk rock album. It turns out that it is more emo, which I hate.
3878	Don't bother: Looks beautiful. Nothing against the poster itself. But for this price it's insane. Pay an extra twenty bucks and get a real screen. Its only worth it if your going to get a nice frame, and even than, its still only a poster. Kinda like a tshirt tux.
3879	one of my top 5 faveorite movies of 2004: it kind of goes from book to book. they start out with one then skip some and go to 2 but it comes back to one later.but still a really great movie! and i can not wait until it comes out on dvd on April 26 2005 it is a must see and also has kind of a happier ending than i pictured.and thats why it is one of my top 5 of '04 and it keeps you on the edge of you'r seat.if i were to give it a grade i would give it an A and i would give raise your voice an A plus.
3880	Disappointed: I am disappointed with the Zenmed products, although they feel nice on the skin they haven't helped with the rosacea which was the reason I bought the product. There has been no alteration in the appearance of the redness of my skin, some people had more or less instant results and others after a couple of weeks and I have been using it morning and evening for over three weeks.I will use the rest of it up and see if there is any change.
3881	AWESOME... Must Buy!!: My 4 yr old has been obsessed with power rangers for a while now and when they brought this phone out we had to get it... it is really cool he spends all day playing with it and saying power ranger power up or spd emergency... i read some bad reviews on the phone being really low and you can barely understand... yes it is low but my child nor his two friends one 3 and one 6 even turn it on they don't want to they just pretend with it and say they are morphers this is a must buy for any power ranger fan... they will love it!!
3882	I wasted two hours of my precious life: This movie has NO plot! Yes, the characters say things and do things and things happene but that's not a plot! This movie wanders on aimlessly. What is it trying to say? What is the point?Brian J White is a good actor. I loved him in The Shield, but in this movie he OVER ACTS! It's like he has no talent at all. The white women in the film are stereotypes, especially the blonde. They played the same 2 or 3 pieces of music several times throughout the film whether they fit or not. One seemed to be played in every other scene.Whomever wrote this needs to try again! Or NOT!
3883	YIKES! This show is awful!: I wasn't expecting a 1989 cartoon to protray Mario's world perfectly, BUT EVERYTHING IS WRONG! It opens with awful live-action that does not even have anything to do with Mario. Sure, the actors are dressed to look like Mario but they hardly do anything that relates to him besides eating pizza and doing "plumbing". The animated parts are a little better, but not by much. They are mostly just parodies like "Koop-zilla" or "Pasta Wars". The enemies are colored wrong and look awful. After a parody it switches back to the live action part to end it. It's an awful and basic try to make a game star a tv star. Get The Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog, that one is really funny and wacky.
3884	A truly engaging read!: Our book club chose this book as our September 2008 read, especially because Sandy Cline is a local author, and agreed to attend our discussion after we finished the book. What an amazing experience! We were able to really get a feel for Sandy's frame of mind and intentions while writing the book.I really enjoyed this book...it reminds me on several levels of To Kill a Mockingbird, one of my very favorite novels. The young southern protagonist, the racial themes, and the strong family influences are all reminiscent of Harper Lee's classic. Pug is a very memorable character, and her "sisters" all add a vital piece to the story. The plot has a lot of action, several surprising twists, and really pulls you along. I found myself breeezing through this book.Overall, I thought it was a great choice for our book club; it allowed for a very satisfying discussion of the central themes. I would definitely recommend this book.
3885	these things rock!: I gave them to my daughter and she tells me that she "absolutely adores them and cannot wait to get the matching seat covers"
3886	My unit has been replaced three times!: I have to say, in general what the unit does and the service is pretty incredible. Set up wasn't too difficult ( dish network ) just a bit time consuming. Problem is after 2-3 month the units modem fails to work. It cannot dial into tivo central for programming data. It has been a real frustrating situation - setting up 3 units, having my tv majorly distubed after sending back the damaged unit and waiting for a replacement. and the fact that you are so spoiled with this that when you dont have it it drives you crazy! :-) Im giving up on the phillips unit at least in my case and going to try out a sony unit. perhaps Ill have better luck.. Also have to say the 50 minutes on wait for a tivo troubleshooter is a bit irritating to say the least - try doing it 4 or more times....
3887	Buy an Ipod: I bought this and it worked for a week. Very poor quality. Pay the extra and get an Ipod Nano. It's much better for the few extra $.
3888	My daughter loves this games: I bought this game for my 12 year old daughter, so she can play some of the games that i played long ago. I never expected she would like so much this games, specially the newer version of Pac-man and Galaga. I belive this games still can be fun to play by young kids.
3889	Megafault - mini fun: Not a good movie. Bad actiing, marginal effects, the best past was the "Making of" special feature.OK, the scientific basis is utter BS and I can live with that but even with that this movie doesnot really play fair within its own context. Actions and reasons of the characters make no senseat many points and violate even the most minimal of common sense.
3890	Absolutely Hilarious! MUST READ!: Stupid and Contagious is an absolutely hilarious look into the lives of two neighbors, Heaven and Brady. It follows their stories seperately as well as together. It is highly entertaining!!! This is one of those books where the author captures things that you only think you have thought about and have said to yourself. I highly recommend this book, you will love it! 5 stars, all the way!
3891	Modern crap: This is an example of modern crap!It is the most poorly designed machined hand tool I have ever seen with the name Stanley on it.The excentric cam (it tightens the blade) on my old stanley low slope broke and I thought I'd replace it (knowing I'd never be able to by the part...through it away and replace, we don't "fix" anything any more) I purchased this item. What junk ! I regret owning this. After much filing I can now actually retract the blade for storage and extend it for use without having to take it apart. The adjusting and tightening mechanisms have been redesigned and function lousey.
3892	definitely worth buying: This book has fascinating stories of ordinary and extraodinary people. For each person interviewed, there is a picture or 2 and a story told by that individual. The writer did an excellent job at capturing these stories in first person...i felt like I was actually sitting in front of these people and listening to them tell me about a moving incident, their childhood, reflections on life... Some of these stories made me laugh and some made me cry. It was a neat experience to "meet" all these interesting people. The photography is beautiful
3893	Book is great----: Book is great. Delivery was horrible! And I still had to pay for it. I'm really disappointed because I needed the book right away and had to wait for it. I didn't receive any notification from Amazon that it wasn't in stock until I went hunting for an answer as to where my book was. Pretty disappointed, my assignment was late.
3894	Great true story of courage and perserverance.: This is the true story of an ex-Polish army Officer, sent to a Siberian Labor Camp and escaped! He and 3 comrades escaped in the dead of winter during a blizzard (to cover their tracks and prevent being followed by dogs.) The story is of their escape and trek to India via the Gobi Desert, the Mongolian Steppe and the Himalaya Mountains. Great, epic story of human courage, endurance and perserverance. Book was first published in the mid fifties and has been in and out of print since.
3895	A Re-make is better than a classic?: I usually don't like children movies, but this one was enjoyable. Everything in this movie is better than the original. The special effects are better (of course), the girls are better actors, and it just seems more believeable than the original. Classics are usually not outdone, until now. If you waited, than you're lucky because you can benefit from a better version on DVD in a cool "white clamshell" case.
3896	Quintessential acid: A few years after the die-off of the acid house obsession of the late 1980s, Hardfloor decided to "resuscitate" the TB-303 bass emulator for the '90s. They gave the sound a mightier thump and many more layers of squelchy, wet, bubbling, screaming acid. This album alone set much of the foundation that made the 303 the lead guitar of dance music for the '90s. For a while after that thousands of artists adopted the acid sound, and you have to admit, even the most avid acid fan got pretty tired of those overused acid basslines. TB Resuscitation is a tribute to the proper (ab)use of the 303.
3897	ummm: I do not think she has fabulous voice! Shes ok, but not good. I think the only reason she has made it this far is b.c her family may have money, but i think she sould go for something else. I kno others that have a much better voice. But, Keep trying gurl!! ur kewl!
3898	A poorly written, shallow book on the Patriots: I have very little in the way of positive feedback on this book. I would say that there are a few insights here and there that are interesting.Otherwise, this book was subpar in every fashion. The writing was very, very poor. It was simple, contained some errors, and was frequently very confusing. The writer jumps back and forth in time and leaves out critical details that constantly distract. About 1/5 of the book is comprised of very dull descriptions of a few football games. Another 1/5 of the book is repeating many of the same things about Belichick that we already knew.The only people I can see enjoying this book are people who either know very little about football, or fans of the Patriots.
3899	The more I read, the more I liked Annie.: If you like books written by self-absorbed whiners, then this is the book for you. I had heard an interview with the author on a local radio show and thought it might be an interesting book. He certainly has the gift of gab, but is definitely not a writer. After the first few chapters, I realized that the book was more about the author, his "career", and his distorted views of love and friendship than an interesting yarn about his travels. It's a shame that he would resort to writing an entire book to dump on someone who obviously made the right choice in not marrying him, and cash in on it as well.
3900	I read all this before: I was very disappointed in this book. If you have read Benjamin Franklin and John Adams you have already read 80% of this book.It was just a review of the dozens of books on the Revolutionary War. It barely mentioned Dolly Madison and basically stopped with Martha Washington, Abigal Adams and a little bit about Benjamin's roomate. Big disappointment.
3901	don't believe the hype: I knew the author in college and enjoyed her fiction for the Harvard Advocate, admittedly against my will.I read this collection hoping that the spark she had shown back then had developed into something more substantial. Unfortunately, "lucky girls" is as unimpressive as she was--mediocre, pretentious, run-of-the-mill with a passably attractive cover.My advice to Nell: Better luck next time (though perhaps her luck has run out--much has been wasted on this overhyped collection). There's talent in there somewhere....but these stories ain't where it is.
3902	Timeless: This music brought me back to the piano. After I ordered the CD I ordered the songbook for it from his website. Of course I cannot play as well as he does- but playing his music is as much an experience as listening to it. His playing is first rate, his emotional range and power are impressive. His technique is very strong and the performances are a joy to listen to and the pieces themselves are like musical stories.
3903	Worth Every Penny: These are very beautiful and so very life-like animal figurines. The quality is superb and worth every penny of the cost.
3904	SHOULD BE ABOUT COLLECTING PENSION: I was disappointed with this book. I think it was advertised wrong. I bought it because I am trying to get past due child support. Well if the father works "under the table" this book is not going to do you any good. You should only buy this book if you trying to collect child support from someone with a career.
3905	A CD you'll want to listen to over and over.: This may be Elton John's finest - certainly Honky Chateau, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and this one are his best. Elton John displays his wide range of talent on this album. High Flying Bird is one of the greatest songs that nobody knows about. Elderberry Wine is a classic rocker. Well worth having.
3906	The 10th Victim: A catastrophic misfire on all levels, Director Elio Petri's The 10th Victim should be shown in film schools across the world as part of a course elective called "Everything That Is Wrong With Italian '60s pop art Cinema".It isn't interesting, it isn't engaging and it isn't remotely frightening, it isn't Futuristic, it isn't sci-fi, and it isn't a dark comedy.It was almost thirty years before I actually saw it, and I found it to be, in spite of all those film school reviewers who think it is brilliant, one of the worst and most boring movies ever made.
3907	Great Product - Need More!: With twin two-year-old boys, we've found a gazillion uses for these things - over ceramic tiles for clumsy crawlers, between high chairs and carpet (food cleans up easily), as quick and accessible diaper changing pads, under toddler playground equipment, and even for building giant cube playhouses. We did think they were a bit expensive at first, but found them to be worth the price.They sell out quickly at Toys R Us and Home Depot. Employees from both stores indicated that they wished they could have more of these in stock since they run out so quickly.
3908	a disappointment: Unfortunately, Samuelson's writing skills are far less inspiring that her gold medal win of the first women's Olympic marathon. Her co-writer does little to add clarity and excitment to the work and, instead, just muddies the waters further (the two of them continually alternate writing, switching from the first to third person with no clear segues). Even the information it delivers is old news (advice such as: ibuprofen relieves menstrul cramps). There are so many better instructional books about running.
3909	Taco Bell Music: People have said that you don't even notice that the guitar is gone and think that is a good thing. I just see it as another example of how mediocre this music truly is. If they had a guitar you would not notice if it was there. They play nothing interesting w/ their piano. Are they forever stuck w/ the same five keys? Their drumming is the saddest thing you could pull out of a drum machine. The singing and lyrics sound like the mutterings of the most bored nihilist I've ever heard. Ultimately, all the songs just run together with that same dry bored british whining, the repitive piano, and sorry drumming making me actually wish for the noisy and alteast distinct american whining of Nirvana.
3910	horrible sound: I bought these ear phones since my last ear phones, Apple M9394G/B iPod In-Ear Headphones, broke after mishandling them. I was looking for a cheap alternative since my former apple ear buds were $40. What a mistake going to these cheapo ear jbuds. The sound quality is horrible. For those of you that know what bit rate is, these $20 jbuds (j for junk) make your beautiful radio quality 192 KB MP3 sound like a 64KB MP3. No exageration here. Say you are listening to an orchestra - 1/2 of the instruments disappear when using the jbuds and if there any vocals, they are noticeably dulled. Don't buy these ear phones if you appreciate quality.
3911	crash bandicoot games are always awsome!: this game is going to rock! i have every crash bandicoot game so im not going to stop now if you liked ctr youll love this. crash bandicoot sold 43 million copys so thats a big seller so im getting this game and do should you! Dont think its like ctr because its not its got new wepons and new awsome levels so buy it baby!!!
3912	Very nice! 2 out of 3 were keepers!: After reading previous reviews, I purchased 3 of these from gold box for $49 each.... I loved two of them - GORGEOUS! and the third set was as dull and greasy grey looking as earwax.When they're good, they're GREAT!
3913	Disappointing: This book never grabbed me the way I had hoped it would. None of the characters is particularly engaging, and indeed some are barely tolerable. This is a 360 page book that reads like a 600 page book. I'm not what you'd call a plot-junky, but this book was just too slow and too boring. There are only three or four memorable scenes in the whole book, and only one of them possesses any dramatic tension. I think Forster set out to make a statement about relations between colonial power and colonized people. Certainly he accomplished that, but then again he could have done it in a page or two. Instead he threw together a mediocre work of literature to demonstrate his point.
3914	Very disappointing: If you're thinking about getting a Mobb Deep album, I would highly recommend that you pick up 'The Infamous' instead of this one. There are a few nice cuts like 'God Pt3' and 'Drop a Gem on them', but other than that, it seems a little rushed. 'The Infamous' on the other hand, is one of my alltime favorite hiphop albums.
3915	Action Drama/Comedy and super music.: Richard Dryfuss and Holly Hunter are fabulous in this wonderful remake of "A Guy Named Joe". Full of great flying, laughs with John Goodman, and a special appearance of Audrey Hepburn in her last film. You'll love it!
3916	doesn't stand up: This product is cute as can be but the poles provided have no place to be put, meaning we can not get it to prop open. The directions tell you to put the poles in from the top but there is no opening to do this. Obviously defective.
3917	works well: They do a good job of preventing me from having any issues when eating dairy - so that I can enjoy an occasional ice cream or coffee with milk.I like the individual wrapped pills because I can keep a few in my wallet and a few in my car, so I have them whenever I need them.
3918	Literary and religious analogies, historic content, not worth the graphic exposure: I watched this years ago with a teen son, didn't like it then; watched it with another son as a school project again (hence the rental) and continue to dislike it. Too cruel and graphic. I can learn about fascism, cruelty and get an idea of certain historic events without the bashing of heads with hammers and slashing cheeks open, etc., etc., and the strange creature at the tempting table. The creatures were bizarre and subtitles bothersome. Persecuted girl overcomes odds and wins by losing, by self sacrificing to be in a better place is a 'works based' theology that comes out. Too bad it's not true, makes for disappointing conclusion.
3919	Does not run on Windows XP: On the box it is printed XP compatible. But it is not. I tried XP compatibility wizard. But it still does not work.The seller "Best Bet sales" did not refund.
3920	Can you say BORING?: This game just doesen't cut it. I was expecting more of a Tony Hawk style play. Controls are slow and the game is not interesting at all.
3921	Disappointed: I am a big fan of Martin Clunes and his Doc Martin series so I ordered this DVD. I found it disappointing, really quite silly plot. I plan on reselling it.
3922	Great concept...poor product: The concept of this product is great, however what the manufacturer does not tell you is that there are many devices in your home (cordless phones, baby monitors, even your PC) that could interfere with the reception of the remote receiver. I spent many hours trying to tune the receiver with the transmitter with no success, even when the transmitter and receiver were within feet of each other.I found the documentation and technical support for the product left a lot to be desired also.I have chose to ditch the idea of using the tuner remotely, but I am going to use the device as a wired device to my home stareo. Plugging the device directly into my home strero provides great reception and terrific sound quality.
3923	Hunk of junk...: I can't believe there are so many people that praise this junk. 1 GB for $140? That's crazy talk! You can get some 1GB players for less that $70 now. Sure it's an ipod, I guess you all want to be cool (FYI not all MP3 players are ipods, that is just ignorant). If you want something that has terrible battery life, horrible durability, is WAY overpriced and so trendy that everyone has to have one just because it says Ipod, here you go. But I would reccomend a zen mirco or one of samsung's players before this junk.STAY AWAY!
3924	Travesty: This wasn't a movie. This was an exercise in merchandising. The first three Batmans weren't exactly spot-on, but this one was insulting to all Batman fans. George Clooney was fine as Batman as was most of the other cast (except Arnold, whose part should have gone to Patrick Stewart). I put the blame squarely on Joel Schumacher's shoulders. In trying to resurrect the TV series from the 60s he has shown he has absolutely no understanding of the character. Warner Bros please note: Keep the cast, REMOVE THE DIRECTOR! And please, NO KURT RUSSEL!!!
3925	Special Features Suck !!!!: I gave this movie a 5 out of 5 cause the movie itself is awesome. Absolutely just amazing...BUTI had to give the special features a 1 out of 5 casue they suck.Thats just the only way to describ them. There NOTHING of intrest really. Just some intreviews with people about the movie, some other crap about underwater life and stuff. ABSOLUTELY NO SPECIAL FEATURES about spongebob, NO SPECIAL FEATURES for Kids. They would HATE these lame excuses for special features..... nothing interesting or fun at all.Boo to everyone who had imput on this DVD for the spcial features, they really droped the bomb on it !!!!
3926	Stain Away: I have used Stain Away for several years and have found it to be a superior product to any off the shelf products. My dentist recommended it at least ten years ago and I have used it constantly to clean my dentures. The last time I saw a dentist, he remarked on how clean my dentures were, no coffee or tea stains, no stains at all.
3927	Light duty-no service after the sale from Manufacturer: We got a few uses out of this and then the gears started slipping. We consulted the owners manual to find no company name or address and no nummber to call for service. Next time is a little Troy Built from Lowes. This just wasn't a good deal at all.
3928	Journey to the end of the night: I have to admit that after reading this book and its follow on "I am a masochist." From the start, it is almost impossible to describe the levels of self debasement Celine puts his character through. The direction that any chain of events will follow is clear after the first three sequences. Down! In most cases they don't start on a very high plane.I don't believe for a minute that the scenarios pulled screaming from Celines mind are something the reader will carry with him / her after having have thrown the book down in disgust. The general feeling, yes, anything else, no.The writing style, at least as translated, is a slow go.As to why I finished it, the first sentence is my confession and excuse. There was something that held me. The friend who recommended kept asking, "weren't they funny?" To that I can state, for me a resounding "NO". He asked, "Were they good?" The answer to that is given above.
3929	Great: Great movie, watched it with the kids too. My Grandmother may have given it the best endorsement, saying "every family should watch this"
3930	Love it!: I first discovered Daniel Kane over twenty years ago on the streets of San Francisco, and his ethereal music still haunts me. I was thrilled to find that his music is still available - this CD is a good representation of the wonderful music he makes with this most unusual instrument.
3931	Provocative theory, poor presentation: I find truth is best found by thoughtfully considering ALL perspectives, so purchased this video seeking Admiral Byrd documentation and any foundation for a hollow earth theory. What follows is interesting old footage, but a total lack of any scientific rigor. There is not only an absence of any references, but the venue and the speaker are not even identified! The two DVD's include a presentation of his beliefs, an old video on the Arctic regions, and a poor quality B&W movie titled Unknown World that abruptly stops in the middle without any ending. If you want to learn more, this isn't a product that will help you find it.
3932	THIS IS ONLY THE NEW TESTAMENT: Nowhere in the description could I find that this was only the New Testament. I ordered it and received it...and SURPRISE!!! I had bought THE SAME THING at a Christian bookstore in the area and it was the WHOLE BIBLE. I was very disappointed. To top it off I had to pay shipping to return what I felt was Amazon's error in not being specific.
3933	A real American woman: Reardon's latest work is an excelent representation of the hunter / gatherer mistique of small town rural america. Under the apple pie and quaint county fair, there is always a story that every one knows but nobody talks about. Mary Culpepper makes her own decisions, for the right reasons or the wrong; at least they are hers. Mary is in the middle of her life, living with her past and excepting her future. Reardon's portrayal of a real woman is excelent. I felt for Mary but its hard to have pitty on a woman who you know will survive.
3934	Multimeter Functions: This multimeter performs the basic functions OK but does not have a simple continuity check. A continuity check is one of the main reasons I bought the unit so I rate it 1 star.
3935	If you're still learning about sewing - BUY This book: There's a lot of books out thee - but if you're still learning a lot of the more advanced tricks - BUY THIS BOOK. Seriosuly - I am usually happy to get half a dozen new ideas out of a book - usually makes up for what I spend - but that is all this book is about. New Tips and Tricks.I was estatic to see some of the coat lining techniques used in one of my Amrmani coats broken down and described so well. Its like "OH Ok - thats how its down" Its full of stuff like that.Maybe if you've been sewing for 30+ years and have a college degree in fashion - you might know everything from cover to cover already - but if your a still new or an intermediate still learning - this book is an ideal find.
3936	Good to have in the field: Good to have in the field. I can hang my Rino 530 from my pack or out of the way to save space on my belt and still keep it in hands reach.
3937	NOT WHAT I THOUGHT: I was thrilled to be able to have this under the Christmas tree, however, when I went to play the movie, I learned it first had to be downloaded from a website. When I put the disc in, there was an error. Needless to say, it was returned.
3938	Perfection: This is Natalie at her best. She is genuinely funny all while singing like an angel. Florez does a great Mes Amis and plays the innocent lover charmingly. This would be a great introductory opera for young people.
3939	Missing 6 hours of great music: I can't believe they did not include Rick Springfield on the set , I will never buy it . It's so not complete . Why bother?Bob G. quick cash in cause of the bootlegs . Sorry excuse !!!
3940	Rip off: This price is a rip off. I added up the price to buy all the seasons separately from amazon.com and the total for seasons 1-9 was $239.91 that's more than $100 cheaper!!!
3941	I found this book very dull: I found the book Complete poems of Stephen Crane very dull. The poems were not inspiring.
3942	Pitty you went to Warcraft Rich :): First ill say im magic / wizards / Raistlin fan all the way and there isn't one wizard in the entire book, though that fact haven't hindered my pleasure from the reading in the least.Richard did excelent job with the entwining of the stories and ill tell you the truth i haven't had one favorite story and one "i just had to read" all of them were greatly enjoyeble, from the characters, throo the plot all the way up to the politics.Great job on the book, a must read for any Dragonlance fan and for those still don't know it.
3943	Good looking book.. but...: Well, it was a nice book, nice paintings, some nice watercolor tricks...but it just didn't inspire me..something was missing.Maybe it was the "cold how to do" approach, that came up all through the book and the lack of originality. Im sorry to say i was disappointed.
3944	Finally -- Real black women and grown-up black men: Finally, a thoughtful feature-film portrayal of characters who have ambitions, hopes, desires -- and happen to be African American! This character-focused film will appeal to those who prefer indie productions to plot-driven Hollywood blockbusters and trite rom-coms. It deals with slow revelations of character and interpersonal complexities.As the lead female, Marie-Francoise Theodore turns in a nuanced performance as a painter struggling to balance her artistic ambitions and emotional needs. She and the men in her life confront the stereotyping -- divas, mammies, strong & silent --that stifle honest relationships. "Strange as Angels" is a welcome relief from films that cater to the UPN-TV view of black womanhood as either as high maintenance divas or ho's, and of self-absorbed or immature men. If you liked recent character-focused films like "Lost in Translation," or "Sideways," this is your speed.
3945	Complete Idiot's Guide to Anatomy & Physiology: Fantastic Product. I am studying Anatomy & Physiology, and have the technical references, however, this book puts complex things into simple analogies and terms.
3946	Best Movie ideas: Best movie idea since "Star Wars" - gives great hope that weaker beings can make a significant difference if they really try. Supports the idea that God will support the balance of nature and doesn't take sides - that is, God sees everyone as equals! Absolutely beautiful presentation and amazing technology!
3947	Quick dry to the rescue!: This purchase was an upgrade from my old Hoover steam cleaner, and it is definitely an upgrade. The quick-dry hot airflow following the cleaning allows the carpet to dry very quickly. This particular feature makes using the cleaner an easy choice, even under short notice from arriving guests.
3948	Christmas Gift For Mom: Griffin 9781-TRP30BK iTrip FM Transmitter with Dock Connector for iPod (Black)The product was difficult to work with and weeks from Christmas, my mom is still trying to get it to work. Some signal is picked up, but not enough to make this product worthwhile. Because the product is not from Amazon, you cannot return it, which makes for a frustrated customer when he/she finds that the product is shotty to say the least.
3949	Dragonball Final Bout: We received the game for Playstation , Dragonball Final Bout today. After a few e-mails as to when it would arrive, it finally came today. My son is Very disapointed, as it will NOT play on his Playstation 2. :(So, I can not rate this game at this time. We sent another e-mail to the company that sent it, but are still waiting to hear....A very disapointing expenditure.
3950	the worst book I've ever met: Barbara Kingsolver tries to sound important, while her work contains so little interesting elements that its almost a chore to read the book. Her plot is non-existant and her characters are semi interesting but still, not quite "real." Perhaps if Kinglsover took some classes in plot development then the book would have a half way decent and coherent story. Bad stuff all around, stay away from this book.
3951	Just plain wrong: Please don't buy this inaccurate text. It has at least one major flaw. The author incorrectly claims that the horizon is always at eye level. It's easy to see that's false. Walk into the Grand Canyon and you'll notice that the horizon is well above eye level.
3952	Saving Private Ryan: Special Effects Rock. Content a little too grafic for enjoyment by the gentler individual. Acting was excellent, and the story was well thought out if perhaps a little too realistic. I think they did a great job
3953	Canon PSC-65 Deluxe Soft case: We bought this camera case as part of a package for our camera (Canon PowerShot A540.) We were very disappointed in the quality. It is rather cheap in appearance, and has poor utility in that when you open the case to take the camera out, whatever is in the accessory pocket (spare batteries, memory cards) is not secured and falls out. (We ended up going to Best Buy and purchased a Lowepro case that has a zippered compartment for the camera, a separate pocket with velcro flap for accessories and a smaller zippered pocket on the flap for memory cards, money, etc. Cost of the Lowepro was about $11.00.)We don't recommend that you include the Canon PSC-65 Deluxe Softcase in your camera purchase. It's a waste of your money.
3954	OEM Replacement Battery for APC back-up power supply: Normally, when the battery fails in a small back-up power supply it is not economically advantageous to replace it -- so the entire power supply becomes "trash". Moreover, off-brand replacement batteries are frequently not good quality. Amazon sells the correct OEM replacement battery for the APC back-up power supply at a price (including shipping) low enough to make battery replacement worthwhile. This is good for consumers, good for the equipment we own, and good for the environment. Thanks.
3955	Too short: This book contains only a few pages of text and is heavily cut down from the original. Also the "squirt" tube on the back page is too big in diameter to squirt water out for more than a split second.
3956	Exciting page turner: I could not stop reading Crank or Glass. I feel like I know Ellen Hopkin's family and want to give them big hugs for enduring such a trial. Can't wait to get the other titles in the series.
3957	Great Poetry Lost: If you have never read the play and think that singing and dancing talent are irrelevant in a musical then this may not be the worst film ever. Otherwise do a double bill of Henry V and Tophat.
3958	BEWARE: IDENTICAL to the CD entitled "Choral Favourites from King's" (subtitled: Classics for Pleasure - the title of this release!) from EMI Classics ASIN: B000JJ4G7A -- DO NOT ORDER, unless you want a duplicate!
3959	CF Enters the OO World: This is a very important book for ColdFusion developers, as we begin the inevitable shift from procedural to object-oriented programming. Discovering CFCs covers the whole topic: from an introduction to OO and CFCs, through simple examples, and on to complex heirarchies of CFCs. It also points out the problems and bugs with CFCs as they exist now, yet another reason to pester Macromedia to stick with CFCs and fix their problems. Overall, a must-read for any ColdFusion developer who is interested in staying current with their skill set now and into the future.
3960	These caster wheels do not spin freely: I installed these wheels on a 12x12" scooter board. Before installation they feel like they spin freely even though the wheels are not uniformly on center - they wobble. Once installed these wheels do not track or spin freely. They are complete junk. Do not buy them. These are going right back to Home Depot.
3961	Still depressing; now made even WORSE through an introduction by Elizabeth Ammons: The best part of this edition is the cover illustrator. Jeffrey Brown deserves more attention -- the illustrations were great.Elizabeth Ammons took a straightfoward story and post-neo-racia-femini-homo-colonia-hegemoni-classstruggled it in her introductory notes. This is what passes for scholarship? Good grief. This book is not so difficult to understand, that she had to decide that race underscores the whole thing. And Toni Morrison as an expert opinion leader? I'm insulted, but I'm not surprised.Last, one would think in a world where Howard Zinn's corrupt scholarship has been so thoroughly discredited, that scholars would be reluctant to cite him so prominently in their work. Seems reckless.Edith Wharton wrote about what she knew: misery and lost chances. That's Ethan Frome. It becomes all the more poignant and painful to read it as an adult -- but good literature does that. It grows on you.
3962	It has its moments: This would have been a real standout if they had kept the book's ending. While silly overall, there are great parts--the color, the music, the physical appeal of the actors. Add to this the compelling world of mountain climbing.
3963	1 exact match found!: This is exactly what I wanted.I'm happy to report that the black Adidas Campus show is real suede and arrived promptly. I will never, ever go shoe shopping again. This is my first stop.. unless they run out. such a pity they ran out...
3964	the best spaghettiever: this is the best tasting spaghetti, I would highly reccomend it. I wish they would sell the seasoning mix seperatley so i could use it for other sauces.
3965	terrible!!!: This is a forein made cheap bar. there is a 45 degree weld in the corner where the weight plates should sit tight against the collar. This lets the plate flop back and forth. There are a lot of better options.
3966	Would not play on USA region 1 blu-ray player & slow refund: Don't buy this dvd and expect it to play on USA-AMERICAN blu-ray players made for region 1. This dvd box set was advertised to play on any region blu-ray players. I tried 3 players and the players would not even recognize there was a disc in the machine. I even called Amazon to report the problem and recommended that the dvd information should state that it will not play on USA region 1 players to avoid the lost time and returns. I also asked if Amazon could find this dvd set made for USA region 1 so I could buy it. I don't feel I got much help from Amazon.
3967	it didn't last long: Everything worked fine for the first 2 weeks. Then the bulb burned out in the middle of the woods at 10pm. I had to use the light on my cellphone to get home safely. Very disappointing.
3968	Good: I loved this book. I laughed the whole time and, yeah, there are some parts that made me feel like I was a giant porker, but they made some great points and I think I'm healthier for it.I wouldn't let young girls read this book, because they have enough body image issues, but in your twenties, yeah, this is worth the read.
3969	This is not music therapy!: One cannot "do music therapy" for oneself. Music therapists hold degrees, complete internships and are board certified. Although music can be considered therapeutic, music therapy itself is a specific professional application. If you would like information on true music therapy please go to the American Music Therapy Association website [...].
3970	Very strong spring.: I bought a pair of these and only had to use one. I put the other one back for future use.
3971	Excellent Audio Quality, Ears might hurt: The sound quality was great for the price. I do not know if this is particular to me but ear hurt after listening to an hour or so.
3972	A Cute Spider!!!!!: We just purchased this book a few days ago, and my 17 month old daughter already loves it!!She loves hearing all of the different sounds and the pictures really seem to hold her attention. Also, the text on each page is not too long, as she can't seem to handle books that are too long at her age.I love the ending, it is very cute and sweet!
3973	Dissapointing Ending: I was totally absorbed with this book throughout until I got to the end. I wont reveal what happens, but basically everything is resolved in about a page, leaving me wanting to know more. The book just follows the formula too well, dragging us through Jemima's life, wondering how it will all turn out, only to leave me dissapointed in the end. Also, the changing voices of narration was odd and at times distracting. Also, it seemed that several threads were never really dealt with, just mentioned once or twice, leaving you to wonder. I hope this doesn't mean there will be a sequel...
3974	Easy To Use and Solid: This base is very well built and easy to use. The latch system is very well designed and once installed in the car is very solid.
3975	Not Portable: I bought this "portable" DVD player that bills itself as being the perfect solution for watching DVD's "on-the-go." Unfortunately, as of the time I purchased it, the description fails to note that it must be plugged into a wall outlet or car power source. Thus, it won't work on a plane, and if you use it in a car, you apparently have to run the cord up front to the power supply. I think the name and description of this product is misleading. The documentation states that you can buy a universal battery pack, but that would increase the cost substantially.To be fair, the return process for the third-party seller is going smoothly, and after a bit of resistance, they have also agreed to reimburse the shipping costs for this item.
3976	Save your receipt.......you're gonna need it!: All I can say is keep your receipt. The wireless rain guage is a piece of garbage. Apparently made in china. I had mine set up for almost a month before the transmitter melted down. When I contacted them I received a chain email saying that I had to supply all of this specific information (which was included in the original email) to get an RMA. I had to provide copies of the sales receipt in order for it to be covered by warranty. Somehow I thought when I bought Oregon Scientific stuff it would actually work longer than 30 days so failed to save my receipt. Nope, it's back to my tube and float, $3.99 at Wal-Mart.
3977	A Bridge Over Two Worlds: Becaud's music becomes a bridge over two worlds (fracofone and anglofone), now that he no longer is among us. In the same time, it is a bridge over time. Some Americans can have French nostalgias and travel up to Quebec City to find Becaud, among others. That's why is easier and useful to buy this CD: to travel through space and time a click away.
3978	Died 1 month after warranty expired: Apparently I'm not the only one who has had this problem. Google for C82 problem and you will find that many, many people have dead C82 printers just out of warranty.Leaving this printer idle for a while causes the ink to dry out and requires a head cleaning, often times multiple cleaning cycles are required. This uses ink from all cartridges even if only one is clogged.Additionally, there is a cleaning pad built into the printer that can only handle a certain amount of wasted ink. Once it reaches this amount, your printer is either dead or must be serviced, requiring a good bit of money.Avoid this printer, its faults far out-weigh its benefits. Look at http://bearfruit.followers.net/12832 for more details if you're interested.
3979	Recommended for all baseball fans: This is a fine book, recommended to all baseball fans. The book is structured around a single game in June 1982, with a description of the game and asides on players and events. Each chapter covers one inning, although the events of the inning may occupy only a few lines in each chapter.By now (2000), most of the players and events are ancient history. But the game remains the same, and any fan would enjoy this book
3980	What the???: This game was so slow, ugly, clunky, plotless and a poor excuse of a diablo clone. I immediately smashed this sucker after a few minutes while puking my head off. I'm still puking.
3981	He's Back!!: This is Paul McCartney's most consistent and solid album, start to finish in ages!! Many of the tunes are very popy and catchy. The song that would have to be my favorite out of the whole album is really, "Lonely Road", that is a very solid tune.Other notable tracks include: "Driving Rain", "Tiny Bubble", "Your Loving Flame", "Heather", "Freedom" (Featuring Eric Clapton), & the ballad "From A Lover To A Friend".
3982	I would give it zero stars if possible: I bought this dvd for my 2 year old son. After one tortured viewing we threw it in the trash. To begin with, Hard Hat Harry himself is difficult to watch--- he prances about the screen for an hour. Aside from his frolicking (to be polite about it), one hardly gets to see any trucks or other equipment in which a child would be interested. When you combine this with Harry's "odd" affect and genrally irritating demeanor, you end up with a video that it unbearably difficult to watch.
3983	I LOVE this soundtrack!: I bought this soundtrack, even before seeing the movie, after listening to clips on the movies website. I was sold. I was familiar with Frou Frou, Coldplay, and Nick Drake so I figured the CD HAD to be good. Well, it is GREAT! It is a mellow rock/pop CD so don't plan to rock out, but if you are looking for some beautiful indie pop like music this is for you! Zack Braff has done a great job with both the movie and the soundtrack. See the movie, you won't regret it. Can't wait for more from Braff.
3984	Mediocre album from an exceptional singer: I bought this album thinking it would be tight: "it's Beyonce so they're gonna give her nothin but hits for her album..." how wrong I was. Crazy in love was hot, Baby Boy was hot, Hip hop star was a hot mess, Be With You was hot, The Closer I Get to You was a dissapointment, Yes, Me Myself and I, and just about every other song on the album I didn't mention (espescially The Closer I get to You) were flat out boring and that daddy song just made me uncomfortable, why was that on there??? I loved Dangerously in Love on Survivor and was excited to see what she would do differently with it on this album... the b*tch didn't even resing the vocals!!! She just put different production behind it and called it a day, but whatever. Anyways I'm kinda sorry I spent my 8 dollars on that album instead of just downloading the few songs I liked on it.
3985	Eeeewwwww: I thought i would give it a whirl. should have rented it first. I never would have bought it. Don't bother.
3986	TWISTS ITSELF INTO INSIPID MEDIOCRITY: The name should have been a give-away but the top notch starcast had me fooled. Don't let that happen to you, this clunker sits squarely in the list of promising movies gone down the drain because some underemployed scriptwriter thought it cool to stage a twist-a-thon, with a beaten-to-death theme of a suffering cop investigating a series of murders (in The Bone Collector style) where the murderous psycho ends up being either one of the main characters or a friend. It doesn't help the cause that Judd is no Kim Basinger, and the intimate scenes (perhaps the only possible selling point in absence of a discernible plot) are thus about as titillating as a Yoga workout. The movie is decently made but the director clearly had very little marrow in the script to suck on. Skippable tripe.
3987	Great CD with some rare ones!: I bought this CD for the song "Things I'd Like to Say". But having "The Mighty Quinn" and "I'd Like to Get to Know You" are great rarity bonuses.Every Song on this CD is enjoyable if you are tired of the ones that are over-played on oldies stations.I recommend.
3988	Great product: These are great! I grew up with one of these and decided to buy one for myself. I am glad I did. First night I got it we went camping and it dropped in the 30's, I was sure glad I had my trusty blanket. I would recommend this to anyone.
3989	description is worth 1000 words: First off i am not an owner and likely will not be an owner on description alone.Second this product is a parking break cable it needs to do 2 things not stretch under load and not snap like mine did other than that it engages the rear disc or drum breaks when you engage the emergency break.This can not improve fuel economy nor can it improve the appearance of the vehicle unless it had mounting clips to hold it out of sight should the retention spring break other wise it would be invisible from anyone not looking under the vehicle.If I were to word the description i would make points on its durability and how it would not stretch or snap or fail to keep the breaks locked... Something to the effect of being so tough and durable you would trust it with your life.
3990	frustrating: I am extremely disappointed with this product. Upon replacing the cartridge and turning the handle to test it, immediately there were creases in the outgoing plastic. I have tried repeatedly to re-stick the plastic together with very little success in removing the bumps/creases that come out. There are numerous creases in the lamination. This was a total waste of money.
3991	Think twice: The TIVO HD is a piece of junk. It's sluggish, channel changes are slow, and the Internet features work poorly.What's worse: I bought it, returned it, canceled the Tivo service (if you don't call to cancel they will keep charging you $14/mo!), but they kept charging me even though I haven't owned the hardware for 5 months! I called to cancel again months later and they want to charge me a $150 early termination fee. For what? They gor their hardware back 5 months ago and I'm paying for nothing! Avoid. Go with DirecTV HD DVR!
3992	This seller sucks: I ordered this for my sister who is an anime nut and when she opened it for her birthday and the so called 'Full metal' poster was an InuYasha wall scroll. Luckily my sister also loves that anime but they confused orders and did not give me the product I ordered. I wont be returning because my sister loved her gift but I will definitely NOT be buying from this seller EVER again.
3993	I'm rating the item, not The Simple Life: I Just recieved the second season dvd and just watched the first 5 episodes... but theres at least 9 episodes in season 2, not just 5. What the heck is going on...-There is only one disc (as it even says on this product description)???? Anyone else have this issue?
3994	Pleasant way to get your iodine: A reasonable way to get ones dose of iodine, and it doesn't taste bad. I chew it, and that's fine.
3995	Not that great of a blade...: I don't know why, but I tried this blade on porcelain, and it just did not make clean cuts! It actually cut worst than the stock Husky blade! Not sure if it was just a bad blade from the start. Maybe someone has any ideas why? It just did not make clean cuts and I did not feel confident using it. I really thought it was going to be a great blade!
3996	waste of time: Don't let the title of this book fool you. This book is a waste of time. Has ideas, but is way short on details. You are better served spending your money elsewhere if you're tryin to learn about building cabinet doors and drawers.
3997	Right wing polemic: Laura Ingraham's idea of a feminist is someone like herself. A member of the Independent Women's Forum, a right wing think tank bankrolled by sugardaddy Richard Mellon Scaife. Someone who serves as decoration on MSNBC under the pretense as an "analyst"(lol!), flirting with the camera.
3998	B!+che5: No-talent posers that sound so whimpy and watered down. Yeah, they like to dress like they're "soooooo cool and bad" (lol!), but their music is no different than any lame @55 Nsync or BSB album. Don't worry, GC will be tossed aside in a year or so, just like all the other trendy fads. "The Young And The Hopeless" is what their loser fans are. Morons. 5h!+ like this never lasts, thank Christ.
3999	A sorry goodbye to a giant: Dallas had already run out a steam by Season 13. Now in 14 with many of the original characters gone, it's a pale and pointless ghost of itself. But I bought it to complete the set, if only to get one more glimpse of the magnificent Linda Gray as a Sue Ellen who never met JR.
4000	bearing his soul: i pickup pj's new album, "pj is dating your sister" after seeing him live at souix fall this labor day. after listening to the album 100+ times, i think i have a grasp on it. songs like orange county and sam the goat give a testimony and confession at the same time. what is love and all alone speak of his weaknesses. this album does an excellent job in the release of everything deemed important and satisfying in this fleeting world. listen with your ears then listen with your heart. tasty, tasty tracks with lyrics that have boggled my brain. the beats are positive and uplifting along with his message.
4001	Movie is great, UltraViolet Digital Sucks: The movie is a very good addition in the Underworld series. The disc release with UltraViolet Digital Copy is VERY BAD.Why change digital copies away from what works. You cannot store your digital copy on any computer, you have to have an internet connection and an account to watch you digital movie, no internet, no movie and slow internet, no enjoyment. Whoever decided to start using only UltraViolet must have been paid off by the UltraViolet backers.
4002	Not her best work..: I have read every other Anita Shreve out there, and this isn't one of her best. She goes the extra mile, explaining in great detail every aspect of the book, but the end is sorely disappointing. Try "The Last Time They Met" or "Where or When" instead - two of her best.
4003	terrible movie, big waste of time: I am ashamed I watched this through to the end. what a worthless, horrible movie. avoid it. Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman should be ashamed.
4004	sucks: first of all, this is not my cd, my little brother bought it, and even he doesn't like it that much. I felt i should write a review because i was so offended by the absolute crappiness of this album. Hawthorne Heights would have gotten 3 stars out of me if they didn't have that goofy looking dude whose only purpose is to make some noise that is a hybrid of choking, vomiting, screaming, and at times, hissing. the only good material is the bonus material. at least on the demos you can't really hear the ugly scream dude. the best song on the cd and the only good one is 'apparently hoverboards don't work on water'. too bad they didn't stick with the whole Day In The Life thing and not suck.
4005	IT SUCKS!!!!!!: THIS IS THE WORST GAME I EVER PLAYED!!!!! THERE'S ALMOST NUTHING TO DO IN THE WHOLE GAME!!! WENEVER I GOT IT TO DIGI-VOLV IT ALWAYS DIGI-VOLVED TO A LOW POWER DIGI-MON NEVER TO A DIGI-DESTEND DIGI-MOM PLEAS DO'NT WAIST YOU'R MONEY ON THIS GAME PLEAS!!
4006	probloems galore: I bought this product from skype. they have no customer service number, so they are not addressing my issue--namely, can i have a refund?? it doesn't work with my linksys wireless, and there's no solution. i can occasionally get connected and make a call, but once i'm off the call, it disconnects and won't reconnect. it gets hot, and the sound is bad. a big waste of money.
4007	people that care: it is a very well put together book.i am on page 204,it covers a lot of ground,and it is in depth.the cover is neetly done and the pictures are great.the wording is not miss leading.norman peale has done a lot of books and they are good
4008	Graco playard: My only complaint is you can't just lift the bassinet out and have the base ready to use right away. You have to take the bassinet base out and insert it in the bottom of the playard to use the base. Minor detail, but it does add another step and takes away from the convenience of use. (FYI, buy the little mattress that goes with it. These are super hard for baby to lay on. With my first children, they didn't sell the mattress. So glad they came up with it!)
4009	Take Flight: Beautiful catchy rock. You absolutely can not help but sing along, tap your foot, and sing these songs in your head for the next week. They went on to form Buzz Zeemer with Tommy Conwell. Gotta check out their self-titled debut that just went to CD. www.record-cellar.com
4010	GREEN DAY ARE TERRIBLE: Wow!I just cant believe that anybody could like a band as awful as Green day.They are overrated,lame,lousy awful and stupid.Each and every song on this album is bad especially the horrible boleuvard of broken dreams.AVOID THIS ALBUM AND GET ANY ALBUM FROM LED ZEPPELIN,THE WHO,PINK FLOYD,QUEEN AND AC/DC INSTEAD.
4011	Thoroughly Enjoyable: If you want to know why James Taylor has had a successful career for forty years listen to this disc. Taylor delivers warm folk and light jazz perfomances of a dozen holiday tunes. This one should please Taylor fans, folkies, and any one who enjoys holiday music. Highly recommended.
4012	WWW!!!: This book gives harsh reality about Middle east.I believe he gave his best answer for "What Went Wrong?". He is very informative. I enjoyed his point of view. One of my favorite sentence "Europeans managed to create a Christianity without compassion, so did some Middle Easterners create a democracy without freedom."
4013	Disappointing Papal Bull: I was very disapointed in this "revisionist history"!Much is extremely "Bias"!The Producers should remember the United States was founded by a "Freemasons Kabal". And I would contend the we are better off today for them!The DVD attempts to incorrectly connect NAZI's and "Illuminati" and other "Secret Societies" (i.e. Freemasons and Templers). The only connection is they are exact opposites in their political beliefs. There is a very strong link to the "Thule Society"(Germanic Teutonic wantabees) on the other hand which the DVD Producers completely overlooked.From there the Producers try to create a Conspiracy involing the Soviet KGB,GRU and western "Illuminati". Need I say more!
4014	another superb King book: Although the book did drag on at times, this fourth in the series of books about Roland was a great piece of writing by King. He lets the reader get an insight into Roland's past, and consequently, his behavior with his current partners on the trip to the dark tower. I can't wait for the next book.
4015	One of the wisest books I have read: This is a book to read a little of each morning and evening. It is incredibly wise and peaceful. I give it to my friends and would recommend it to anyone over 45 who would cares about their life, its meaning and direction.
4016	unhappy: I use to love this toy when I was a kid. I have had to order this product twice, due to poor shipping handling/packaging. Both times this product showed up in pieces. The plexiglass fell off causing the needles to fall out of the case.
4017	blown? crap?: i got the speakers and both of them didn't make a clear sound when you push them down so i immediately returned them, got replacements 2 days later and only one of them made the sound so i put them in any way and it was clear for 2 days, then started distorting, the other one lasted maybe 2 weeks. I don't have time to keep sending them back so i have to live with 2 of my 4 speakers blown. Good while they lasted but don't reccommend
4018	Wartime Christmas in Luxembourg: This well written account by Peter Lion will touch your heart as you follow the story of GI's in Luxembourg in 1944 and a Christmas to remember. They donate their packages from home and Corporal Brookins plays the part of St. Nick. The people of Luxembourg remember this act of kindness on the part of our soldiers because it is still celebrated today as year after year the story is reenacted in the small town of Wiltz with our GI's as the honored guests. The book is well written and will give you a glimpse of the compassionate side of a terrible war.
4019	Easy to read...: Big words to help my eyes, cross references at the bottom, and in conjunction with a good Reference book can help you find the word of God that you are looking for in a snap.
4020	Awful Book for the Experienced: I'm an experienced programmer that had to learn Java in a hurry. I picked up this book thinking that it would give me a general introduction which I could then fill in as needed by reading parts of a reference book (Java in a Nutshell). After 40 pages, I realized that this was a BIG mistake. This book is way-too-beginner oriented. I found its presentation style petty and irritating. Fortunately a colleague told me about Bruce Eckel's Thinking in Java. This is a much better book that treats its reader like an adult!
4021	Dum Dum Dum...OJ is not guilty!!: When will America open their eyes. This arthur is so blinded about trial antics that he forgets the main goal of the trial. Lawyers plan their case to win win win ...They do not consider someone might really be not guilty. If you really want to know her killed Nicole.. ..read The Frame of the Century.
4022	Terrible excuse for a movie: There once was a story, a classic to all, that captured the hearts of those short and tall.It was a story of a cat in a hat. The story was great, perfect in fact.And then came universal, they tore it to bits, until it was naught but a pile of inappropriate jokes that don't make sense, making up 90% of the story. None of it made sense. Inappropriate jokes, unneeded parents (Or, step-parents), a dog that wasn't in the book, no colors except purple and green, randomly exploding cupcakes, going into a portapotty that leads to an underground dance club... the list goes on.Seriously, this is not a kids' movie. And it's not for anyone who loves Dr. Seuss. Basically, it's for stoned 20-year-olds.
4023	Not an accurate movie. Pop culture entertainment fluff.: If you want a feel good about the brits type of movie, go ahead, but it's utterly cr@p from a historical perspective, with most men who worked in Jap prison camps boycotting the movie through its history. A Blu-ray release is no reason to buy it, it's just HD fluff.
4024	BORING, TRITE & UNFULFILLING-AND THESE ARE THE GOOD POINTS!: I have read every Patricia Cornwell/Kay Scarpetta novel and each one has gotten increasingly worse. Last Precinct never got better from start to finish. There is little plot or character development. Disappointment in Ms. Cornwell's efforts is only surpassed by a feeling of disappointment that this author's work has so deteriorated that she does not feel the need to give her readers a fair return for their dollar. Shame on you Ms. Cornwell. This will be the last book of yours that I purchase. You are cerainly resting on your laurels and they have run out!
4025	Great Light, Poor Life: The OEM Headlights on my Honda lasted 5 years before the first one burned out. I bought two Silver Star bulbs and installed both. The light is pure white and is a noticable improvement in brightness over the OEM bulbs. I was very happy with my purchase until the first bulb burned out after about 3 months. I thought it must just be a fluke and bought another pair, replacing the blown one and keeping one as a spare. The second bulb burned out after 9 months. I'll be trying something else when the next bulb burns out!
4026	monotonous: essentially, this is dull and overlong and you keep on wondering when it will come to an end; the main problem is not so much the arrangements, which ARE dull, but also the fact that there are no good songs or melodies here to speak of, and it's a drag that summer breathes 90% of the vocals here, instead of singing with that powerhouse voice of hers; well, ok, 'prelude to love' is interesting and its segue, 'could it be magic' is engaging
4027	Eccentric Family Chronicles: This is a beautifully executed book. Photographs, stories and articles about a most unusual family. The patriarch had a vision of what life could be like without modern contrivances and conventions. Very human glimpse of a chosen eccentric lifestyle, pros and cons. Written by his son Rider.
4028	Much of the specifications are exaggeration from the truth: If the manufacturer didn't lie in the product specification, I would give the radio a 3-star.As oppose to the manufacturer's specification, this radio:1) is NOT water proof. This becomes pretty apparent, once you hold a unit in your own hands;2) does NOT include any cell phone charger connector;3) does NOT have a really sturdy build. This becomes pretty apparent, once you hold a unit in your own hands.Also, the FM radio receiver is very crappy. I frankly don't understand why the manufacturer didn't bother to install a decent FM radio receiver, which shouldn't be too much to ask in these days.
4029	Bigfoot crapfest!: To say this film is poorly acted is an understatement. To say that the sasquatch cgi monsters are terrible is an understatement. Those B-grade 1970's bigfoot films like Creature From Black Lake and the Boggy Creek series are FAR better than this stinker -- a shame in this age of modern technology and film making. The movie's story isn't half-bad, but its execution was a disaster. This one is for bigfoot movie fans ONLY, and then only if you can get it cheap. Dog crap on a stick!
4030	Discrepancies about Specs -- problem with rebates: I bought the MG19VT in Sept 05. It was advertised at that time to have response time of 8ms. The user manual shows it to be 25ms. Here it is now advertised as 16ms. Interesting. I emailed X2gen when this problem came up and they sent me a "revised" page for my manual which showed the response time to be 8ms. Yeah, right.For a monitor with no DVI and very little adjustment, it might have been worth what I paid IF I HAD RECEIVED THE $75 REBATE. The rebate is sent to an address which leads you to believe it is going directly to the manufacturer -- X2gen. But X2gen says the rebate is handled by none other than Onrebate.com -- and they won't send my rebate. So if you want this monitor, be prepared to pay full price -- don't expect Onrebate.com to send your rebate. And by the way, my monitor has about 30 dead pixels.
4031	My favorite movie: I love this movie. It is Debbie Reynols at her best. She still has it. Her humor is great.
4032	Downtown Abby Review: We were so excited that Downton Abby was back on and the season 3 opener did not disappoint us. Excellent period show. Loved Maggie Smith as usual.
4033	Saying goodby to presentation panic: T.J. Walker's Presentation Training A-Z takes the mystery...and the terror...out of making presentations. More importantly, it made my realize I'm not the hot shot speaker I thought I was. With a straightforward, practical style, T.J. offers pearls of wisdom and experience on how to move from good to GREAT with your presentations. Now, whenever I have one coming up, I hit the sections that address the weaknesses from my last presentation and fine tune performance. Response to my presentations has become much more enthusiastic and requests for speaking have picked up so much that I'm now charging more. Thanks to T.J.,I have reason to be comfortable in front of an audience and no one has to know my dog-eared copy of Presentation Training A-Z is in my briefcase.Roger Landry MD
4034	An inspirational telling of all of the truths we humans have been taught to deny: The Myth Of Enlightenment: Seeing Through The Illusion Of Separation by Karl Renz is an inspirational telling of all of the truths we humans have been taught to deny. As The Myth Of Enlightenment progresses, readers will discover a more elaborated and honest part of themselves, in both their social and solitary life. The Myth Of Enlightenment is very highly recommended for its intriguing content and everything it has to offer for all readers, religious or otherwise.
4035	Really? Really now...so not funny....: Sorry, I love Jeff but I saw him at the Pru Center in NJ and unless my funny bone was sleeping, the show sucked. Yes, there were some moments that made me laugh, but I wasn't on the floor laughing like I usually am with all his other works. I'm hoping that by the time they piece together all the different segments from the different locations that it'll be one funny show. But the show I saw, on it's own, not even close.
4036	Awesome mask: I really like the looks of this mask. After the Apocalypse, I plan on being a Lord Humongous-type, and this will be perfect for my needs.
4037	Full of Right Wing Venom: This book is only recommended for people interested in studying how authors deal with subjects when they are motivated by deep seated envy and hatred.The book is a statement about Peggy Noonan rather than a study of Hillary Clinton. Read it only if you want to understand how right-wingers feel about socially progressive politicians.
4038	Can't wait for the apple pies: This was a gift for my son and daughter-in-law. They love it. Can't wait to get those apple pies.
4039	Kawaii!: I found this manga completely by accident and have been addicted to it ever since. If you like Gravitation, or any other shounen-ai type mangas, this one is for you. It is a series of different stories, all based around a club called B&B. The club is a member's only, exclusive host club, where if you're rich enough, you can rent a boy for a day, a week, a month, or the rest of his and your lives. Every story is about someone who is connected in some way to the B&B. Each story is very sweet (though there is almost always sex, so this is not for someone under 18). It's really too bad that no one has licensed this story, and that it's so hard to find now. I really recommend it to all yaoi/shounen-ai connoisseurs.
4040	Gave 1 star b/c wouldn't let me do none lol: I really thought there wasn't a version of Jane Eyre that I couldn't at least like if not love. Well now I found one. I found 'Jane' to be a complete doe-eyed idiot & Rochester oh my dear Rochester... George Scott butchered the hard, ill-tempered man I have come to love. I paid $0.99 for it at Walmart but I still feel a little cheated. lol But seriously this was the worst version I have ever scene. Watch the ones with Ciaran Hinds, Timothy Dalton, or any other version!!!!
4041	Drug Voyeurs: This movie is for all those sad people who want to do drugs but don't (and there are a great many of them). Watching these two guys get stoned in Las Vegas is similar to watching two people making love, very deeply unsatisfying. It's one of those things that you've got to do yourself. No amount of watching helps. I watched it because of Terry Gilliam, but he wasn't able to find any artistic tension in the "anything goes" atmosphere of a drug binge in Vegas.
4042	"EMI Essential Series" of CDs, not an album title "Essential".: This CD was part of a limited edition packaging by EMI called "The Essential Series". All had the same cutout on the sleeve, all were greatest hits compilations from the EMI vaults. I have a couple of the series. That said, the cd is worth buying for the remixes. Many of the mixes were never available commercially in the US (where this was released).
4043	Way better than I dared to hope: I was excited to find books based on the TV show Forever Knight, and of the three that exist, this is definitley my favorite. The entire book takes place in the space of one of Nick's flashbacks, but the history feels well researched and the story is perhaps of even better quality than many on the tv show. The author does an excellent job with Elizabethian dialogue without making it too obscure for the modern reader; the characterization is also very accurate and the characters feel like they belong to the time in which the book is set, which can be a tricky thing to pull off when writing for characters whom the reader is accustomed to seeing in the modern world. For readers who are not familliar with the show, it is just a good book and does contain enough backstory to keep one from getting lost. This has been one of my favorite finds on Amazon this year.
4044	Brad and Angelina are great together in this film: My husband and I thought it was smart and sexy! Personally, I don't care about all the relationships that came out of this movie (or relationships that were broken). It's none of our business as movie watchers. There is a good chemistry between the two of them and that's what made this a better than average film.
4045	what a disappointment: This product was a complete washout. The pictures were misleading. Not a single cat (and we have many) even looked at these springs. This is not a cat toy in my opinion.
4046	Lower quality than expected: Live in Phoenix, Arizona and need humidity just to survive the dry air here. This unit claimed to be quiet and included anti-microbial in nature. I will say, these claimes are not a fair representation of the product. Always had problems with mildew buildup, even when using the chemicals requested by manufacturer. After a few days the unit started to vibrate to the point the dishwasher is considered tolerable. We would have to shim the water tank with folded paper and toothpicks to get vibrations to lessen. Sometimes a smack on the side did the trick. After two months the unit started to leak out the intake vents.Unit requires refilling every 22 hours or so on medium fan speed. All in all, I think this unit gives humidifiers a bad wrap as I am sure you can get a better unit with less hassles. As it is, $50 is a lot to spend on a night light.
4047	A true synopsis of the Panthers, that should be read by ALL: The Black Panthers Speak is the BEST book out for Americans who want to know what the Panthers stood for. Nobody's interpretation of what the Panthers were about, but only the speeches, letters, and court transcripts of Black Panther members. This book should be read by Americans of ALL ethnicities. Use it to understand that the Black Panthers were a party for ALL people in the struggle for freedom.
4048	This Product is a True "Champ!": My husband and I originally registered for the Diaper Genie, but we changed our minds when we considered that we would only be able to use the Diaper Genie refills. The Diaper Champ allows you to use regular garbage bags. Plus it's simple to use. We haven't had a problem with odor at all. It's a great product!
4049	bedroom phone: GE 2.4 GHz 27980GE3 Cordless Bedroom Phone with AM/FM Stereo and Call Waiting Caller IDThis phone provides a good cordless phone option with dual alarms in a small footprint, which works well for the typical bedside table. Each alarm can be individually customized for either a wake-up tone or your favorite radio station (including personal volume setting and alarm duration). The only drawback to this alarm is the inability to program it by day (or even weekday/weekend). Each alarm has only one time, and it's either on or off. Otherwise, it's a very good solution for anyone looking for a bedside phone that will also serve as an alarm clock.
4050	Waste: Worst product. I didn't like it at all because when i wash them thread is sticking to all other clothes.
4051	Not up to expectations: I was looking for a better pair of earphones and this is not it. Bass was washed out. Performance is not worth the price. I ended up returning them because the performance was so bad.
4052	Great seller for HP Power Supplies: The shipped sent me out the product ASAP I recieved it about 4 or 5 days sooner than I had anticipated, which was great because my power adapter had died. I began having issues with the new one. I happened to be up late into the night so I emailed the seller at 12:58 am I had a response by 1:05 am. He very quickly got me a new adapter! A+++++++
4053	Product is great, but shipping was horrible.: I ordered two of these stockings on November 27th and I was told to expect them on December 1st. I recieved all other packages from Amazon (as the seller) on time except this item. On December 2nd, my package was still in Arizona. I had to contact customer service and see what had happened and why there was a delay. They gave me no information, but when I tried to return the item, they said it was too far in transit. They arrived today at 5 p.m.The stockings themselves are wonderfully made and hand beautifully. They are very heavy duty for the price, much better quality than my stockings from last year, which cost $7.99 from certain female business magnate.
4054	Zero Stars: PRO:- I kept the box, so I can gift this pig to some unsuspecting soleCON:- terrible balance - it feels like using a chainsaw- runs hot- runs loud- hopper fills quickly and must be cleaned out frequently- attachments do not snuggly fit and come detached easily & the hose is too stiff and springy- not convenient to use with the cumbersome attachments that fall off and the stiff electrical cordGood for:- gifting to someone you don't really like, or donating to charity for the tax write-off- hooking it up to a motion detector and putting it outside to scare off burglars, startle small children at Halloween and keep deer out of your gardenBad for:- its intended purpose
4055	Yes, it does work: I use this product every week, and yes it does work. But, there is a trick to it. First, you pull apart the wax strips. Most of the wax will be on one side. Use only that side. Fold it in half, and rub vigorously to soften the wax. Pull apart gently. Then apply, and "rip off" quickly. It works. I actually use if for the face.
4056	Good Look, Good Action, bad bad bad power: Great design, looks good.Great action, good suction.But very bad, in power. With full charge it does not work even for five min.
4057	An Idea Whose Time Has Come: This idea that the setting of intentions without attachment to outcomes can have unexpectedly powerful, positive results first percolated into my awareness when I picked up this book along with a second book at the same time called LUCKY YOU! Proven Strategies For Finding Good Fortune. Dyer is the expert here and the idea of energy flows that human consciousness can 'surf' feels very appealing. The second book, LUCKY YOU, takes that idea and applies it to streaks of good and bad luck, showing how our intuition, our dreams, and paying attention to synchronicities can lead us to good fortune. Dyer seems to have inspired a whole new cottage industry of self-help books and themes!! More power to him!!!
4058	The worst of the new Little Feat recordings.: I was a huge Little Feat fan and appreciated all of their later life recordings until this one. It marked the end of their collaborations with Craig Fuller and was a lyrical disaster. Boom Box Car is the most out of touch song I had ever heard at that point in my life.It's almost rude to trash on Little Feat. I love them as a band, but this record was awful.
4059	Not as bad as I thought: Even though this is just a so so film, which first scene makes you wonder if it wouldn't be better to stop watching it at once, and do anything else instead; its plot gets sort of interesting some minutes later, and doesn't bore you as much as you thought it was going to.Nevertheless, Leelee Sobieski shows what a fine actress as much as and attractive woman she is.
4060	It followed the book: I am an ERB fan and this movie followed the book very well. The special effects were done very well.
4061	Ear Muffs: Product is too small; no way to tell this from the ad before I bought. I would like to return, but to & from postage is more than the product!! I should have talked to the vendor about the product before ordering. I assumed (bad thing to do!) it would be big enough - never assume - classic case of "let the buyer beware!" I certainly share the responsibility for getting something I can't use, but I think the vendor should have had a better description - dimensions, how tight the connecting band is - or how big a head it would comfortably fit. On the positive side, delivery was quick, & I got just what I ordered.
4062	Bottom line: not worth the money: Good in theory, disappointing in practice. Seems like this product belongs in a schlock catalog. Device is flimsy -- wobbles, rocks. I need several inches of clearance in order to unlock neck/shoulders; this device sinks too close to the floor. Should be sturdier, perhaps wider. Also, the foam seems cheap, is not entirely symmetrical. I didn't notice in the picture that the top end has a piece of foam as a footer, which seems to add to the wobbles. You can literally place your head up and down several inches without finding the "spot" you need. It's not uncomfortable, just lacking structure and thus lacking therapeutic benefit. Disappointing, since it could be a helpful device if better built. (And would still have a healthy profit margin at this price point.) -- I get better results from using a very thick book, onto which I can relax, remain still, and let gravity work.
4063	A must have for anyone lost in the world of Twin Peaks: This music really brings the Twin Peaks experience to another level, making it consume your daily reality. Even if you never watched the show, this is great music for mood and atmosphere. From the mellon-collie theme, to the classicly morbid Laura Palmer theme, and the great dark jazz pieces, this is a great listen the whole way through. Julee Cruise provides melodic vocals on several songs, including the disturbingly haunting "Into the Night". Angelo Badalamenti always suprises you with his parts and instrumentation, and Lynch's lyrics are great. If you're a fan of the Twin Peaks reality and want it to seep yet further into your own, or if you're just looking for some surreal atmospheres, this is a great buy.
4064	Terrible.: The Typography on the cover is bad. It use cliche fonts, and breaks the basic rules of typography. The contrast in the colors is also bad to the point that color blind people cant read it. It is all around bad. Don't do buy it. If you want a good design book check out Ellen Lupton's books.
4065	HEY DISNEY!! PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS MOVIE ON DVD: I HAVE BEEN WANTING SEE THIS MOVIE FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS, SERIOUSLY, I SAW IT A COUPLE OF TIMES AS A CHILD. AND I HAVE WANTED TO SEE IT AGAIN, FOR IT LEFT QUITE AN IMPACT ON ME AND LETS FACE IT, NOT MANY MOVIES DO THAT TO YA THESE DAYS.
4066	Go elsewhere: I am a great fan of Kyung Wha-Chung in things like the Beethoven or Brahms concertos, unfortunately her Vivaldi is as boring and old fashioned as I Musici's. Great things have happened in the last 40 years regarding baroque music. At this point it is quite simply impossible to ignore what Harnoncourt, Leonhardt, Gardiner and several others have found about period performance practice. If you want a lively, interesting and very well played Quattro Stagioni go for Fabio Biondi and L'Europa Galante in OPUS111 or Il Giardino Armonico on TELDEC. May Kyung Wha-Chung look for the Elgar or Korngold concertos next time or learn how to play the baroque fiddle.
4067	This Production Exceeds Expectations: This video REALLY impressed me.. I have been buying martial arts videos for years and am always disappointed by the quality of most "slapped up" productions.This video is definately the exception. Very clear, well lit, concise material and audio that can actually be heard.. hallelujah.The material covered is well rounded and informative.. Stances, grips and strikes are all covered in reasonable detail, allowing for months, if not years of study (actually more like practise material)If you are looking for the quick fix, bridge guide to swords, this is not the video for you. However if you are serious about learning and ready to put in the time to practise these forms diligently, then this is for you :) (more material covered in this video than 8 months at my local kenjutsu school)
4068	My seven year old!: My 7 year old really enjoys playing this game. He recently joined the chess club at his school and I thought this would be a good way for him to learn how to play. It also is great way for the two of us to spend quality time together! A great alternative to tv and video games!
4069	Too many errors and mistakes: I agree with Benoit Launier; this book simply has too many errors and mistakes it makes it more difficult to learn Precalculus. It even makes you very frustrated. If you want to study Precalculus I recommend that you buy the The Complete Idiot's Guide to Precalculus or Precalculus with Limits (by Lial, Hornsby, and Schneider).
4070	I can't wait to read more about Maggie!: This is a great book about a little girl, during a very difficult time in her life. She is a realistic child that pulls at your heartstrings. I can't wait to read about her next adventure. I read the book quickly and then gave it to my daughter. She is enthralled.
4071	the maker fog ware will rip you off: purchased this product in 2011 and found the maker unwilling to re-validate your license code when reinstalling after system crash!
4072	Interesting take on Pride and Prejudice.: Very different take on Pride and Prejudice. If you like having all kinds of different ideas to the great Austen story, you might want to get this.
4073	a good, quick read: I enjoyed the rich tapestry of the Italian community in San Francisco. I enjoyed Dante, although the character too much a caricature: several comments too many about the amazing nose, for example. But the evildoers are too melodramatic, the characters too thinly drawn, and the outcome too predictable to be suspenseful.
4074	A great show!: Thought this show was going to be another middle of the road fantasy anime. You know the drill? Girl gets taken from our world and put into a fantastical world that is full of wondered, but the characters are incredible the plot makes you want to marination this show like crazy. Best fantasy anything of the last decade!
4075	Funniest book I've read since "Without Feathers.": There is very little contemporary comedy in literary form. This ranks among the best (along with everything by Woody Allen and Daddy's Boy by Chris Elliott). A novel that combines both great jokes, great stories and even a story. You don't know how funny (and smart) Bill Maher truly is until you read this book
4076	I am disappointed.: I'm a huge SEP fan but this one disappointed me. I really could care less for the first 7 chapters and the book was more about her mom than it was about Jake and Fluer. I love "Kiss An Angel".. That book is definitely my favorite.
4077	Missing Pages: This book is great except for the fact that pages are missing!! Apparently this is not uncommon from this publisher. Check that you have all the pages when you receive the book, so you dont get screwed by Amazon's return policy if you don't happen to read the darn thing front to back in the first 30 days...
4078	I wouldn't purchase this again: This cable is cheaply made, something you might find at the dollar store. It does work, but quality is not so good and I could not tell a difference, (albiet, I am not vvery perceptive in being able to see subtle differences).
4079	I don't see the big deal: This game has to be one of the most overrated ones in recent history. The graphics are simple, 2D, and not very detailed. The least Ensemble could have done is add visual effects, such as weather, to make the game realistic. The civilazations give you close to no variety except for one unique unit which doesn't make a big difference and some special abilities that don't make a difference either. There is also too much micromanaging that you must do to suceed which gets boring after about ten minutes. I played this game for about three days and stopped because it just got frustrating. With four different resoures the game can get very time-consuming and complicated. Add that to wimpy weapons and a lack of strategic elements and you have one pointless game that takes up a ton of unesscesary time. Go buy Tiberian Sun instead.
4080	Not as good as the original: The origial model 300HA was better because the blades were closer together and did a better job of quick chopping small quantities. This model is still worth while and a valuable addition to any food preparation area. Too bad you just cannot buy replacement blades..
4081	BEWARE!: My spouse and I were looking forward to a night of entertainment... what we got was only disappointment. If you are sensitive to nudity DO NOT SEE THIS. The OPENING SCENE has a man (whom I assume is Ulysses)in dim lighting completely naked. This is a prime example of why we should rate ALL media, not just films that make it to the theatres and video games. There is no doubt that Monteverdi was a genius but this interpretation may not be the best way for a new-comer to experience his art.
4082	Very Informitive: This book answers lots of questions and clarifies many misconceptions people have about the Catholic faith.Each chapter deals with a specific topic, so it is a easy read. Highly Recommended.
4083	Better than expected.: When I first opened the box I wasn't too impressed. I had bought a pair similar to these years ago and ended up getting rid of them. But once I tried them on I was a quite surprised at how well they fit. I was worried at first that they might be a loose around the calves (the problem with the other pair). But these tightened very well. Other comments were posted that the material was too stiff and caused blisters on the ankles, etc. I do not think the material is too stiff and should break in rather quickly. The boots look a little shinier than in the picture, but that won't last with extended use. I really think these are going to work out in the long run and I would recommend them. Good value.
4084	== Groucho is Back! ==: Ron Goulart has managed to capture the spirit of Groucho Marx in wit and dialogue. Although that alone gives this book a life of its own, the plot and character development is masterfully delivered and a joy to read. I can imagine no other than Groucho himself uttering every line. A must for Marx fans and a good mystery for fans of the genre.
4085	THE BEST! what is it about? what isn't it?: The classic, hillarious, juvenile, and accidentaly deep book. The only book I own which I can pick up and start reading any where. It is my bible, or anti-bible. 42
4086	Best of Ronnie Earl Review: This CD shows the talent and diversity of Ronnie Earl.His tone and chops are excellent.
4087	Perfect for what it is: I have always been used to being able to move around a lot. Sitting in an office chair for hours upon end is like a small, personal hell with the knee problems I have. I got this to supplement my workouts, break up the monotony, get the blood moving and keep my knees limber. Under my desk does not really work, my knees hit the top, but I put it off to the side, grab some reports and go. This is not going to get you in shape at all but it will help with general maintenance and if you have pain, mobility problems this gentle, easy bike is perfect.
4088	Beautiful mood, beautiful voice....: If your first memories of Christmas date to the middle years of the last century, this album will transport you right back there. It'll evoke the warmth and innocence of that time, and re-connect you with the feeling of Christmas wonder you had as a kid.If you're just interested in a spirited Christmas album that elevates the mood of the season, you'll certainly enjoy this one. Jo Stafford was one of the most distinctive vocalists ever, and her unadorned, straightforward style will give you a new appreciation of these familiar holiday tunes. She clearly poured her loving personality into these renditions, and created a Christmas gift for listeners that gets ever better as the years go by.
4089	A mere 24 pages of large print and lots of blanks: Not worth the money.BTW, this is an introduction on writing an outline from a topic in your head, not outlining an age appropriate short essay. No way my son is going to do this without learning to go the other way first.(also, I am forced into reviewing this as a toy, not sure why --- it is a booklet, not a toy)
4090	Tips on carpet: I've owned this CD rack for almost an entire decade. It holds up well through moves, and it did it's job in holding CDs. Unfortunately, there are too many problems with this CD rack to justify any price point above $15:1) It stands well on bare floors or very short carpet, but if you have medium carpets, this thing will tip over as soon as you touch it.2) If you attempt to move it, it's very easy for the metal portion to become detached from the base plate. You have to either slide it across the floor using your foot to "kick-slide" it, or waddle it to your new location. Or you can take it off the base plate and move it separately.3) Since there are sections that hold several CDs, if you attempt to take the bottom CD out of a section, you have to hold the rest of the CDs in place, as they'll also fall out due to gravity/friction. If you have this CD rack sitting on medium-thick carpet, this also causes the entire rack to tip over.
4091	simply the best book i have ever read: Nirvana, the messiah to music, the revelation to grunge. Kurt Cobain will forever be known as a rock n roll hero. This book completely explains his life, allowing you to enter Cobain's world. The book also features tons of color photos, great for Nirvana fans' walls. I gained so much information from reading this book. There are some crazy facts about Kurt. For example: he would have casual conversations with his friends about suicide and murder. He was also a wrestler and a track runner. No joke! Pick up this book and learn everything there is to know about grunge's God, Kurt Cobain.
4092	Snug fit sleeve: Fits fill on my Acer 12.1 netbook. Has only one handle so thats why the four starts. The color matches the picture.
4093	Purchased as a birthday gift: purchased this as a birthday present to my son who owns a 1999 Audi A4. Have used the Bentley manuals for other cars and they are far superior to the run of the mill books available. The step by step instructions and illustrations encourages the driveway mechanics to delve deeper into car repair than they may otherwise have tried. Using the book to do one or two repairs will no doubt recoup the book cost in savings from having to pay a mechanic.
4094	Quieter dog now: This collar works great with my dog. I only have to put it on him every once in awhile to keep him from barking. It only needs to spray towards him once then he stops with a little startle. But after that he doesn't even need to wear it for a few days, I think he is not sure if he is wearing it or not. Then once he starts up again with any little noise I put it back on. Good on keeping him quiet with out hurting him..
4095	Brilliant, beautiful work: An album full of lovely Spanish/Latin compositions, stunning acoustic guitar work and lush, sensitive string arrangements.The song transcriptions provided on Acrobat files are a fantastic bonus for guitarists.Highly recommended!
4096	Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1: This movie is animated, it was definitely not what we were ordering. Looking at the featured ad, what you can't see because it is unreadable is that this choice is the ANIMATED version, this is in very small print on top the the word BATMAN. When we ordered this we thought it was the original movie version.
4097	It says "Dr. Seuss" on the front, but...: This book is dreadful. I didn't realize it was published long after Geisel's death, and it shows. Terrible illustrations accompany a long, boring and inappropriate story. When you buy Seuss make sure you get an original...
4098	WEDGIE!!!: For thoose of you highschoolers out there watch out! If a mean person comes along this thing screams wegie
4099	Brazilian exotica: The choros was - and possibly still is - a popular form for street musicians in Rio de Janeiro which inspired Villa-Lobos to write music in a characteristic Brazilian idiom. It is hard to imagine these works, with their need for a full orchestra, being played in the streets of any city but the combination of percussion and complex rhythms certainly evoke an image of the variety of ethnic origins which form the culture of Brazil. I have not heard these pieces before and so have little to compare them with. Certainly the Hong Kong P.O. enters enthusiastically into the spirit of the music - perhaps someone more well-versed with Brazilian music would be better placed to comment on the authenticity of the performance; to me it seems to convey very well the mood of tropical South America. I would recommend this CD to anyone with an interest in 20th century music, particularly that of Stravinsky, who might well have written works like this if he had spent time in Brazil.
4100	Desperation Redux: You've heard his maniacal rant on late-night talk shows, Larry King, and the Sunday morning news panels for the last 7 years. Nothin' new with "Stickin'".
4101	Not one of the guys: This is not a guy movie, if you want to share with your couple, look for the ugly truth or friends with benefits.
4102	Warning: The product has been changed: I just bought one of these lights and this is not what I was led to believe I was ordering. I had bought one about a year ago and it has 6 LEDs with three brightness settings. That is also how it is described in other reviews and what is shown in the picture. I find the brightness settings very useful, so I wanted to get another one. But when I received the one I ordered last week it has a single LED, not six, and no brightness settings. The light from this LED is not the nice white color of the older one, but a sickly green halo with a white spot in the center. Although I liked the original, I don't like this and would not have bought it.
4103	Enough with the Lions!: I completely understand and genuinely enjoy the Chinese tradition of the lion dance. It is a visually stunning and moving thing to see when done by a capable dancer. But this movie, while building to the climactic end scene, has about 500 lions dancing at the end. All of the lions are trying to defeat all the other lions, and all the while the viewer is left to be confused. Clubfoot was a great addition, but enough with the lions! ...
4104	Easy Listening: I listen to several tracks everyday. i heard one song awhile ago, but never got around to purchasing cd until recently, and it sounds even better today.
4105	LOOOVE it!: Have you ever tried using an iPod? It's too much of a hassle. This is so easy to use, sounds great, looks just as great. I'm buying another soon (my last one was stolen... so I guess I'm not the only one who likes it!)
4106	Great Product: This is a good quality product. Buy it. Don't buy the invitations and risk lost photos.The price maybe a few dollars more but aren't your pictures worth keeping?
4107	Such a fun read!: I really enjoyed this funny book about one man reading the entire Encyclopaedia Brittanica in about a year. It had lots of interesting facts, was quite hilarious and a book I would definitely recommend. It may not be David Sedaris-funny, but it sure came close! All in all, I loved it. And I am looking forward to continuing to follow Jacobs' career!
4108	Great story mode?: Uh...where do I begin? The story mode is the worst idea I've ever seen on a video game. What is the point in having a story mode where it lasts about 15 minutes. Stick with SD:2 if you like seasons to simuate real life WWF. Other than that, though, the graphics ae unbelievable. The entrances will blow your mind, and the gameplay is really good. There's nothing much more to say about the game other than (sorry THQ) rent the game rather than waste your money on it!
4109	I dont have enough good things to say: This is such a wonderful book. Though I bought it with barely any knowledge of Burma or George Orwell, but it sparked an interest in both subjects for me. This book is a travelougue, biography, ethnography, history, and just a beautiful story all in one. Larkin has a smooth, easy to read style. I read this book for the first time over a year ago and I still think about it almost every day. This is by far the best book I've ever read.
4110	So So: The late Herbie Mann was neither a great composer nor innovator in the field of jazz music. He was, however, a talented musician and in listening to this disc, you can gain an appreciation of his abilities--and weaknesses! Overall, this isn't a bad disc but the choice of material and lackluster arrangements make for a rather uninspired listening experience. If I could, I'd give this CD 2 1/2 stars.Here's my assessment of the tracks on this album:BEST: What's Going On, Man's Hope, and Never Can Say GoodbyeAVERAGE: If and Funky NassauWORST: Push Push, Spirit in the Dark, and What I'd Say
4111	Heavy duty product: Very nice and heavy duty product. We take it everywhere with us, the power converging is making it easy to travel with it.
4112	I can't believe they discontinued this!!!!: To me, the Mr. Clean MagicReach mop meant as much to the bathroom as the Swiffer means to hardwood floors. However, I guess the general public had not really caught on because the MagicReach is now discontinued. Lucky for us, Amazon has the Starter Kit available at a good price. Cleaning tubs, shower stalls, sinks, and even tiled floors in and around the toilets and has never been easier, ever since the MagicReach.
4113	The funniest golf book ever.: This book is hilarous. It is for anyone who wants to take a more light-hearted approach to golf, or for people who need to relax a little.
4114	Solid Sustain: If your anything like me, you have gone through a few pedals. I kept buying the cheap ones, and stepped on them too hard, and breaking them. Or, the pedals would get to the point where sometimes they would sustain, and sometimes they wouldn't. This YAMAHA FC-5 is a great pedal and what seems to be the standard for which all other pedals should go by. nice rubber top, with metal (no plastic here!) good, long chord (but not ridiculously long, which is good). Quality to cost, this is your best bet, right here.
4115	VERY NICE!: This system is the most bang for your buck. Easy quick installation and excellent performance make it a great investment. Just be careful all the little rice burners will wanna try to race you!
4116	best Patterson book I've read: This book is exciting, fast paced, and very entertaining. I'm very much into James Patterson and murder mystery novels, and this one is my favorite by him. He is a good writer and has a great imagination. It's always a good read, over and over.
4117	Fits perfectly: I have a Yamaha YPG-635 portable grand and this cover fits the piano perfectly. I can even fit the cover on when the music rack still attached which is nice. This cover wasn't exactly what I envisioned buying when I was looking for a cover (I was thinking of something thicker and more rigid) but it was the right price and does the job. The material seems to be of good quality and it is stretchy so it does have some give. Overall I would highly recommend this cover if the dimensions seem right for your piano.
4118	Living Life Inside the Lines--A wonderful treat!: I know the son of the writer and was eager to read her book. I have done computer animation and presently am in involved in video production. I found this personal history of the early days of animation to be fun, informative, and came away feeling I had a better knowledge of the people involved in this wonderful form of visual art!If you love animation, history of early animation days...this book is a wonderful read!
4119	Kindle used to be good: I got a Kindle for Christmas. When i got it it seemed to be excelent. As time went on it became more difficult to buy newly published books from Amazon. Now when a new book comes out It is not available for Kindle or for some older books in a series #1,2 and 4 are available but not 3. When you go to Barnes and Noble all the books are available for the Nook. I am ready to put the Kindle aside, purchase and Ibook and use the apps to have the best of both worlds.Amazon seems to be playing games with the publishers as the hard cover books are now ten dollars.I got the Kindle, not to save money but to have my books in a portable format.I wouldn't recommend the Kindle to anyone until Amazon stops playing games with it's customes, stops blaming the publishers (B&N; doesn't seem to be having trouble) and makes books available for purchase.
4120	Caveat emptor: While Dungeon Lords is on shelves, it is unfinished. I don't mean the usual unforeseen minor bugs and occasional quirks. I mean Dreamcatcher has, quite deliberately, released a game that is a minimum of 8 months of intense work away from being a viable product. Some of the features didn't work from the CD install, so Dreamcatcher REMOVED them in a patch. Other features (such as the map) are documented, but STILL not implemented.The bugs are too numerous to catalogue here, but they are game-breaking. The issues are too severe for Dreamcatcher to not have known this product is nowhere close to completion, much less ready for retail. So I must urge the reader: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
4121	Totally not worth it: Got those recently and very disappointed after putting them on.The noise cancellation does not work well at all... doesn't even block people's talking from a nearby table; does not block the bus engine noiseSound quality is not worth $450 at all... no base, volume is lower than any other pair.Gotta return those. Totally not worth buying them.
4122	Welcome back Paul !!!: Driving Rain signals the return of Paul McCartney.It has been years since we have had a brand new album.Paul is back in form musically.His melodies and bass playing have never been better.Some songs may have weak lyrics but a few others are pretty good,especially the songs dealing with Linda(From A Lover to a Friend,Magic).Paul tries some different styles."Your Way" has a country flavor,"Riding into Jaipur" has sitars like a George Harrison song.My favorites are "Lonely Road","Magic","About You" and "Heather".I liked "Rinse the Raindrops" but admit it would have been better if 2-3 minutes were cut from its 10 minutes."Freedom" is a nice addition,it will always be a reminder of that wonderful night in NYC.Finally,this CD gets better with each listen.I think it is in the top 5 McCartney solo albums.
4123	THE BEST ON THE MARKET: Hey guys, this will be my 5th Allen scooper. I have many dogs, not a hoarder, but close. Six dogs relieving themselves more than once a day makes me an expert on this appliance(?). Here's the thing - it breaks easy!!! The flimsy little pull parts just snap. My current scooper has duct tape all over it and it's not 6 months old. Jeez can't you fix that one little problem? My husband really lets it SNAP when he "captures" some poop and invaribley breaks it. Perhaps he is attempting to get out of the job, but you could make that a bit tougher for him. Anyway, I've tried several of the other single handed scoops and all it do is fight with the grass trying to extract the offensive quagmire out there. Thanks for making one that actually picks the stuff up i just really wish it were a BIT more durable then you would get 5 stars.
4124	Perfect fit and great material: The product is as described and they fit my size 7 foot perfectly. I will not run without these socks!
4125	Agreat addition to our spices.: This ginger really adds to our pies and pastries. It is not readily available in the local super markets. The shipment was quick and the price was good. Try it you'' like it.
4126	TERRIBLE SELLER!!!!: WARNING - DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! YOU WILL NOT GET WHAT YOU WANT OR ORDERED!!!! BEWARE - IF YOU HAVE A SON AND ORDER THE ONE WITH THE SOCCER BALLS AND SO ON, EXPECT TO GET ONE THAT IS PINK WITH FLOWERS. WHAT IN THE HECK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT? I ENDED UP THROWING IT IN THE TRASH. CERTAINLY MY SON DID NOT WANT IT. I CAN UNDERSTAND COLORS BEING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT, BUT COMPLETE PATTERNS?!!!! AND THEY ARE NOT HELPFUL OR VERY NICE WHEN YOU WANT TO RETURN THE PRODUCT!!!
4127	body worlds , real human bodies: we wanted to go to the human exhibit but it hasn;t come close to where we live, so I got the dvd and its wonderful , it informative and interesting.. I felt as tho i was there. Would highly recommend this to anyone..
4128	This is an orginal heaven shall burn album: it's got nothing to do with bolt thrower. It was orginaly released as an EP in 1998 titled IN Battle There Is No Law. BUt this year, it has been re-released as In Battle...and it contains 12 tracks. 8 regular songs and 4 demos, which sound just as good as the regular 8 songs..not sure why they are demos, they are super high quality. anyway, get this cd if your a Heaven Shall Burn fan.
4129	Sometimes music just makes you feel good: Huey Lewis and the News have made as many feel good songs as any other band in popular music. Even when things are going wrong in their songs, like on "If This is It?" you can't help but sing-along and grin mindlessly. From the distinctive combination of roughness and melody of Lewis's vocals to the solid backing of his talented band (Whatever happened to those great sax breaks that were so common in the 80's?) Huey Lewis and The News rarely disappoints. This collection runs from the band's breakthrough second recording to the DUETS soundtrack. A few quibbles...I think they could have thrown in a cut from the debut album when the band was a little less polished and why the songs are not in chronological order just irritates me. (and that's probably just me!) This band won't change your life, but they definitely have the ability to brighten your mood; sometimes that's exactly what music should do.
4130	Shyne - Shyne: Shyne Po first came on the scene in 1999 appearing on "Reverse" off Puff Daddy's "Forever" album. Then in late 2000, he released his first solo self titled album.1. Dear America (Intro)2. What'cha Gonna Do? - 4.5/53. Bang - 3.5/54. Bad Boyz (Featuring Barrington Levy) - 3.5/55. Let Me See Your Hands - 5/56. Gangsta Prayer (Interlude)7. The Life - 5/58. It's Ok - 4.5/59. N***** Gonna Die - 5/510. Everyday (Interlude)11. Bonnie & Shyne (Featuring Barrington Levy) - 4/512. The Hit - 2.5/513. That's Gangsta - 4.5/514. Spend Some Cheese - 4/515. Get Out (Featuring Slim) - 4.5/516. Commission - 4.5/5Overall:55/654.5 StarsShyne does pretty well on his debut. He keeps it gangsta and speaks his mind on every track throughout this album. He is just another talented rapper that Puffy had under his grasp and let go. Cop this album and support the era when Bad Boy was still alive and kickin'!
4131	Gripping, convincing, and tense: I rented this on a whim, having enjoyed the original series as an 11-year-old. I was surprised at how good the remake is. While I think even the most devoted fans of the original show would agree that there's a certain amount of cheesiness to that fine progmra, there's nothing cheesy at all about this new version. It's gritty, realistic, well written, well directed, and exceptionally well produced. There are just enough nods to the original series to keep the old fans amused and shouting at the screen "Oh, that's an original viper, oh, that's what the Cylons *used* to look like" but the show is completely updated in ways that just make sense. The people who can't control their rage that boomer and starbuck are now women: Get over it. Besides, that new Starbuck is the best character on the show, after the tough as nails Commander Adama.Highly recommended
4132	Absolutely works - no joke: I used to work for Chantal Pharmaceuticals when I was 19, and I saw the actual studies, and photos that were taken of actual users - it's the real deal. Make sure that you apply it evenly to the spots you want tightened (IE, I wouldn't recommend only doing under the left eye, etc.) otherwise, you WILL notice that one side is noticeably firmer. Love it, love it, love it. And - I haven't spoken to anyone at the company in years and years, so this is my honest opinion.
4133	Two and a half stars: The idea of Scary Movie seemed great,but the results aren't so great.Entertaining to say the least,up the story line follows Scream to closely for most of the movie.Some of the humor is funny,but I don't really care to see women with male body parts or male parts in someones ear.
4134	Good: i was surpised how fast the game came actually very glad about that i have alot of fun with it and i would recommend it too all history buffs but the two bad things is it crashes about every time i play it over a hour and a half and it creates too many saved files and doesnt let you overide them but i still like the game
4135	good for the price: sound is good but i found it a bit uncomfortable after putting it on for about an hour, my ear lobes started hurting. it could be just me, or for everyone. except that, the sound is good for the price you are paying.
4136	Remember when pop was fun?: Kristian Hoffman sounds like he's been hanging around with Paul McCartney, Harry Nilsson, Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, and Glenn Tilbrook.Each song is a duet, of sorts, with artists ranging from Russell Mael (Sparks) to Rufus Wainwright to Van Dyke Parks.The songs are incredibly catchy, fun, pretty, and polished.One of the best CDs of 2002!
4137	Not what is shown: The item sent is not the picture that is shown. It is a much cheaper looking Kinetic Classicor. I ordered this one for its style, but it is not what was received.
4138	Hemingway:Life and Work: Book is really beat up and worn out with a lot more marks and damage then described. Very dissappointing even at the low price.
4139	TraditionalChristmasSongsShouldNotBeScrewedUpJustToMakeABuck: Nothing worse than taking a traditional Christmas song and messing it up by any genre. I just heard Merry Texas Christmas, Y'all on the radio and I am about sick to my stomach.Next thing we know someone will come out with a rap album called "Deck the Ho's" -- no difference than this.
4140	Easy to watch.: So well done you enjoy watching it each time you see it again. I think this is one of those films that will be watched decades from now.
4141	You've might have read this one before..: The writer contradicts himself with his own time lines. If the story seems familiar, it is. The writer copied word for word other stories of Mithra and Egyptian mythology. Save your self the time and read some harry potter books, far more entertaining. This get's one star, because a negative ten stars is not an option on Amazon.
4142	Comes with......: A great mic; I am adding this review to let others know what this mic comes with. I ordered a separate shock mount spider, thinking it was not included but I was wrong. This mic comes complete with 1) spider-type shock mount including locking swivel with two standard thread types, 2) a spare band for the shock mount 3) a hard case for the mic and 4) a slip-over wind screen.
4143	Wick Filter: These don't last as long as the original equipment filters, but I like my whole house humidifier - so I have no choice.
4144	beware new electrolux is cheap plastic: The name may be the same but the quality is not. Plastic part broke after minimal use. Keep shopping for something better - it won't be hard to find.
4145	Too Expensive Compared to Other Products: I'm not really a kid. I just don't want my ID showing up here.Yes, I've purchased these, and these inserts are ok, but they are too expensive. You can get virtually the same product in a flesh color for about one third the price of this product. The SAME product. Only thing different is the box they are delivered in and the color. Why pay more for a pink box?The alternative is the Original Looks insert, which can be found at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00076Y684/ref=ox_ya_oh_product
4146	...this is the choice...: I went through all the reviews before buying this book, and I was a bit skeptic about the real results...too good, all the reviews were right!! The way this book otganizes the processes described by the PMBOK gave me a better understanding of the complete set of processes and its links. Combine this book with the PMBOK and Rita's book (recommended as well), I got around 80% in the practice exams and my score was 158 in the PMP test....go for it!!
4147	St. Garbage - Not (just) Metallica's Worst!: St. Anger is not just Metallica's worst album ... This is probably the worst rock album by a major, tier 1 band of all time!! Who can think of a worse album by an all-time great band? Imagine 4000 reviews by hard-core Metallica fans who are dying to hear a Metallica album that they will love. But instead they get this piece of trash. Startlingly bad! This is probably an example of what happens when superstars are told over and over that everything they do is great; they actually start to believe it. Thank god they redeemed themselves with Death Magnetic.Funny - I went to the Metallica concert after they made St. Anger. The fans were excited, standing, shouting, until Metallica would play a song from St. Anger. Then everyone would sit down and take a break.
4148	This book bores you to death: This book was necessary for my class. Maybe it could have been interesting, but sadly it wasn't.
4149	Don't bother: My husband and i are always on the run and we thought something like this would be perfect. It says it's fast at heating them up but once we used it, it took almost 30 minutes! On top of that it has a saftey switch on the bottom so it knows when the bottle is it. Well since the button is so far down compared to the heat band, the lower section of the bottle does not get heated. It took so long and i rather of spent a few more dollars to get something that really worked.
4150	For All Rage Fans: Live & Rare is definately a must buy for all Rage fans. This album brings out some interesting aspects of the band you won't find anywhere else. While I would ratehr listen to Bombtrack on the self-titled album, Hadda Be Playin On The Jukebox and Darkness are excellent tracks, two of my favorite. The only problem is some of the songs on this CD are a wee bit repetitive, but the other songs make up for it.
4151	What a waste-it was almost insulting!: What a disappointment. This book was ridiculous, but unfortunately not to the point of making me laugh. The "voice" of the character Carrie was such a caricature of what someone with little imagination and maybe no experience down South might use-lots of "ain'ts, cain'ts, reckons." The plot was what made me pick it up; abused child trying to cope; however, I would characterize the book as like a "paint by numbers"-so obvious. The minute the author threw in eccentric neighbor Mr. Wilson, who gave the little girl target practice, I knew what was coming and checked the end to be sure. As far as the plot "twist," which was especially ridiculous since I don't think mama would have given much weight to the recommendations of a therapist, it has been done before, and so much better in "Prince of Lost Places" and others. This book was so awful that I wish I did not have to give it a full star.
4152	THE BEST: One of the most terrifying novels I've ever read. And me being an author myself, I can say that with hope that Mr. Enck will keep them coming and not end his valid literary hope here.The killer in this book is nothing like ever seen before. Part Silence of the Lambs...part Excorcist...An incredible action packed read.... And gore, gore, gore... Crossing the line has never been so good. Scary as hell- SK
4153	Same book I already had: I didn't know that this was the same book I already had, but the author decided to fancy it up with a new and improved hardback cover...
4154	Begins well, ends in self-absorbed rumination: This book began as an entertaining description of a woman refurbishing an abandoned villa in Italy. The author brings alive the Tuscan countryside and makes one want to visit the area as soon as possible to revel in the sunshine. The book, however, could have been remarkably shortened if the author had kept her own fanciful ruminations about life out of the text. She seems to look down on the people around her, especially their religion, which is ironic since she takes D.H. Lawrence to task for being guilty of this same attitude of superiority in his book about Tuscany.
4155	Best Stoaage Jars: I fell in love with these awhile back for storing sugar in my cabinet. I moved on to storing cornmeal, then macaroni and graduated to snack foods like trail mix. I think I have become a true fan of this rather than tins which aren't as secure.
4156	The antidote to Seat of the Soul: This was an uplifting, refreshing, energized story and I can not receommend it highly enough. It will make your heart glad. It will make your wife cry. Read it.
4157	BEST SHOW EVER!: Degrassi is pure genious! All the episodes are fantastic and realistic. I just love this series. I love all the characters. I'm so glad we can still see our origional Degrassi cast on DTNG. If you want to watch a really great show this is it! I wish I went to Degrassi High!
4158	Unfortunately, this is not a panacea: I was hoping to avoid antibiotics for my UTI. I took the entire container of the Crisis Intervention Formula, as instructed. And I'm lying here with a heating pad, begging for morning so I can visit a doctor!
4159	Good, nice, funny: This movie is a nice one for all audiences that shows a tender point of view of humor, jack Black acting is versatile and let people knows his talents. Other characters as ESQUELETO enrich the movie with funny acting. The music drives you to the past decades when luchadores were real stars in Latin America.
4160	Unified Vision of Reality: J.G. Bennett's 4-volume magnum opus "The Dramatic Universe", is a search for a unified vision of reality. It ranks with the most important books in the history of human spirituality. "Dramatic Universe" is both, a synthesis of human thought and a practical guide to work on oneself. Using the teachings of Gurdjieff as a starting place, Bennett provides a realistic vision of God, man, and the universe, in which fact and value are reconciled through the Doctrine of Reciprocal Maintenance.
4161	A Great Way to Become Conversant with the Emerging Church: Reggie McNeal really knows how to "translate" the emerging church into evangelicalese, especially for his fellow Southerners. This is an excellent book to introduce people to the postmodern shift and the implications on evangelical Christianity. This is the book I gave to my dad to help him understand what's going in the Church today.
4162	Excellent: In my opinion, this is the best silicone lubricant available. A little goes a long way and lasts and lasts.
4163	A Door Near Here: This book is about these four kids who are trying to take care of themselves while their jobless alchoholic mother is in bed, their father was remarried, the youngest sister wants to find the door to Narnia, and the strange reactions of their teacher Mr.Dodgson.This book was one of those coming of age books.Its like "The Dangerous lives of Alter Boys" meets "Stephen King's The Body"AKA "Stand By Me".I Liked the fact that the kids smoked and sweared.It made it more realistic.THe ending was kinda good.
4164	The Male Mariah Carey's beginning ... and end?!?!: R.Kelly was at his best when he was still ridin' wit Public Announcement.He's always out and on the radio kinda like Mariah Carey, so I think his talent and genius are sometimes taken for granted because of this.I guess because this was R. Kelly's debut and New Jack Swing was on its way out, this album will always standout as his best to me ... well, 12-Play gives it a good run for its money.But as far as I'm concerned, his LPs go down from this debut.Buy this album, if for no other reason, just for the single "Honey Love"!!!!!!!! It's a 10-star song that'll get you "in the mood."IF you haven't already heard this song from waaayyy back in the day, you've been deprived! This track is convincing proof they don't make music like they used to.This track alone knocks any and everything by Usher, Babyface, Anthony Hamilton, Maxwell and John Legend out of the park.
4165	" Don't Waste Your money": It seems that person you play never wins. The so called not real people playing in the game win 99.9% of the time. And the slots keep sucking in your money until your broke. In 5 card draw poker you get the same cards like 2345K or 6789Q 78910A over and over again and when you bet and draw cards you get nothing to make a winning hand 99.9% of the time. The same with 7 card stud.I have played these games at lest 150 times and won only about 10 times. This game is going in the trash!
4166	sucked: i admit, the trailer was hot. Unfortunately the 90 min length film is not. Typical horror monster movie. Eye-candy actors, mixed ethnicity, group of researchers, killed off one by one, fight amongst the actors, etc, etc. This movie is like Anacondas 2. The creatures didn't have enought air time. And when they did, u couldn't really see them in the dark on top of being fake looking CGI creatures. There wasn't any gore or elaborate death scenes. And the ending was so stupid and corny. And i thought Anacondas 2 was bad. Plus, there was dark light/photograpy so the movie was hard to see once it took place in the cave. At least Anacondas had a lot character development. This year has been nothing but really really bad horror movies and crappy PG-13 Disney horror movies. It all began w/ The Ring 2 and and next will be the PG-13 water-down The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Give me a freakin' break. But i would guarantee The Fog and Saw 2 will be decent and have an R-rating. I hope.
4167	A expensive piece of junk! - 0 stars!: I am 5 miles from the HDTV tower in Baltimore (3 stations) - I can see the tower from my window. This piece of junk, even when mounted outside, could not hold on to the signals. A coat hanger did a better job. Found a great (and cheap) indoor HDTV antenna on ... Brings in all 3 HDTV stations perfectly.
4168	Great: A neat little 12V marine outlet - went together easy and looks good on my boat! Not sure how waterproof it would be. Maybe just splashproof.
4169	Excellent Introduction to the Field and Practice of Hypnosis: If you're looking for an excellent introduction to the field of hypnosis and the practice of this ancient art... if you want to learn hypnosis, you owe it to yourself to look into Learn Hypnosis... Now! As a Trainer of Hypnosis myself, this book is a pre-requisite for students taking my courses. The book is a thorough, step-by-step explanation of what hypnosis is (and what it isn't), and then, for people who want to go BEYOND this complete course, the author makes available further resources, including live training opportunities. If you only buy ONE book to learn hypnosis, and get practical suggestions on how to practice, Learn Hypnosis... Now! is the book for you.
4170	Great gift for my four year old: Got the leather police I.D. & Badge Holder to accessorize the deluxe policeman costume outfit that I got for my four year old for Halloween but it wasn't such a great hit with my son. He just kind of looked at it and played with it for a little while and tossed it aside. I think just the costume with the belt would have been enough.
4171	This is a classic? Literature's going down the drain if so..: I had to read this book for 8th grade English.I hated it.Everybody in my class and the other classes who read it hated it.I think that every book you're required to read, you have a sort of prejudice against. But, I'm reading Ordinary People now for 9th grade English and I can tell I'm going to love it. I think that since I live in New Mexico, and Rudolfo Anaya is a really acclaimed author of the state, we should "appreciate" this book.I'm sorry. I just can't do it. I can't see why this is a classic. I guess it was an okay book, but even so, I hated it. Not because it was necessarily bad. Actually, I'm not sure why.Anyway, I have some opinions worth disagreeing with myself. I loved (LOVED) The Catcher in the Rye; others hated it. See for yourself.
4172	Really Good, but not Great: This is a good radio, and I use it every day. It's perfect for my bathroom. However, the bass on the radio is just a wee bit too much, and there's no way to adjust it. But, other than that one thing, I like the radio a lot. It's worth the money I paid for it, and I'm glad I bought it.
4173	Not as colorful as the next book: I read the second book first - this one looks quite colorless in comparison. It does give you some practical ideas of how to paint stripes, outdoor furniture, floors, etc.Ispired by Susan I already colored my walls very warm orange and I love it. I guess now i can color bookcase purple to make it even more playful.
4174	COULDN'T GET IT TO WORK IN ST.CROIX: I WAS HAPPY AFTER RECEIVING THE WATCH, BUT MY HUSBAND HAD A DIFFICULT TIME TRYING TO SET THE WATCH IN THE RIGHT TIME ZONE. HE GOT VERY UPSET AND TOLD ME TO RETURN IT. I DID AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY REFUND WHATSOEVER! THAT WAS ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO! I AM STILL HOLDING ON TO MY DELIVERY CONFIRMATION!
4175	Trying to cash in on the DaVinci Code: I heard a bit of buzz about this book and its similarity to The Da Vinci Code. I decided to pick it up and give it a shot since I enjoy the genre.I must say I was summarily disappointed. The subject matter is very obscure and most of the conclusions that are drawn seem to appear right out of thin air without much concrete thought or evidence to support them.My thinking is that a publisher came across a manuscript that seemed vaguely close to the Da Vinci Code and just put it out there and accentuate the slight connection to try and cash in on the popularity.
4176	REINCARNATION EXPLAINED FOR CHRISTIANS: Anyone who thinks of himself or herself as 'Christian' by orientation but who finds popular ideas of Heaven and hell untenable is likely to welcome this book, written by an Anglican (Episcopal) priest. Fr. MacGregor explains that the concept of reincarnation has a long and distinguished tradition in Christendom and that it remains a highly respectable (and totally logical) way of explaining the obvious inequities of this world, while allowing us to escape from the absurdity of supposing that human beings come only once to earth. This book will be liberating for those who, while attracted to Christianity in an overall sense, nevertheless balk at the simplistic 'Christian' notion that we go (finally) either to Heaven or to hell when we die, without opportunity for further growth.
4177	It had potential, but ran out of gas midway through: This movie started with so much promise, but the writers did know how to bring the movie "home". The first seventy-five percent of the movie is intriguing, but the last twenty-five is ordinary and non-imaginary. It's climax is a let down.
4178	Better than Cats, I'll watch it again and again!: Our family loves W&G so we couldn't wait for this to come out. Great story and nice extras.
4179	It's not made by little tikes: I bought this for my daugther and it stopped working after a day. It played one day and all of sudden it stopped for no reason I can figure out. I called Little Tikes to see if there's a known issue and if it can be fixed and was informed that it was not a product made by Little Tikes. It's made by Kidstation and they "just" borrow LT logo. I was given a toll free number for Kidstation and of course it a number that's no longer in service. It appears that this item may now be discontinued since I can't replace it.
4180	romantic, inspiring music, brought the picture right back: brought picture right back to its history. The music helped to create the entire feeling that you were there. Definitely inspiring music, especially the theme song. I've seen picture 7 times. One of the favorite movies. Right up there is the top 5 robert
4181	Couldn't watch: I wanted to watch this on line with new iPad app, but it kept stopping all the time. Never had the problem before or since. If it was a temporary problem it made no difference since the time to watch expired.
4182	A Classic: This is a older book that only covers up to 1988 but covers those years well. It is in English but was translated from Italian. What that means is that some (and only a few) titles have slightly different names. It gives the history of what was going on with the studios and artists on a yearly basis and then a synopsis of the shows from that year. It's a well done book that I greatly endorse for those who remember the anime from the 60s, the 70s, and the 80's; or those who want to know about them. Particularly the titles we have heard of but didn't get to see here in the States. Some minor frustrations: pictures throughout the book are often NOT related to the text on that page, the index is by the japanese name for the show so it is difficult to find a show if you don't know that name, and some spelling of names are not the same as what is known now.
4183	holy culture great writers: all of holy cultures and branches from their tree great writers like gospel gangstas grits priesthood and idol king are.
4184	Is it required?: I ordered this based on the recommendation of a law school prep book I was reading. I was already in my second year, but the review really sold it as useful so I ordered it to supplement my study of con law. I found it out of date for the current discussion of con law issues. I wouldn't order it unless it's required reading.
4185	GREAT ON MACBOOK PRO!: Very nice product. The picture is very clear, the sound is great, and depending on where you live, you will have good amount of HD channels (as well as analog channels). You can also hook it up directly to your cable jack but you will only get analog channels.The HD Stick essentially turns your Mac into a DVR. You can pause live tv, record to your computer or external hard drive and even schedule recordings. The equipment is portable and i can carry it in my laptop bag without it looking bulky. The magnetic antennae base keeps it nice and stable (if you have somewhere metallic to place it). The remote control is compact and intuitive. The box also comes with an A/V input adapter if you want to capture video from your camcorder, game console or other personal media devices.
4186	Stonker!: This album is brilliant, but still not quite as good as "Give Out But Don't Give Up" (IMHO). Classics such as "Movin' on up" and "Loaded" means that most people will find it accessible from the start, but there is also depth in the other songs too. I'm not too fond of tracks 2 & 3, but the rest is brilliant.
4187	It worked great until it died...11 months after I bought it: I bought this because the manual frothers are messy and the battery operated chargers quickly slow down as the batteries wear down. I was careful to follow all the recommendations from other reviewers, including letting the battery run down before recharging. I loved the speed and creamy froths...until yesterday, when it refused to recharge. Now it seems my only option is to throw it away. If it had replaceable rechargeable batteries, I would give it 5 stars, but why make something that has to be thrown away after only a few months?????
4188	I couldn't pick it back up: I heard wonderful things about this book... so I ran out and got it. I read a lot... on average probably a book or two (or three)every month. Sometimes when I buy a bad book, I'll still read it... just to combat boredom at work sometimes! This book was just not captivating for me, I made myself read it half way through, and now it sits on my nightstand with a book mark in it.It's not that Ms. Karr isn't eloquent, she's got a definate talent for prose... which is how I got even half way through, just by enjoying the sentence structure.I can't even tell you what this book is about, because I still don't really know. I know it's about some white (trash) family... her's I assume... in some town... and she did drugs or something.It just didn't hold my attention
4189	Aviation Issues: About 2 years ago an article was written in Aviation Week and Space Technology Magazine titled 'The future of commercial travel is on smaller aircraft.' What started out as an enjoyable read, turned disturbing as every issue Fallows raised was covered in that original article.
4190	canon rear rod holder: This order was sent in a timely manner and it was half the cost of the same item at a sporting goods store.
4191	Not captivating: We bought this dvd when my son was just over 3 months old and have played it for him at various ages. In the past 14 months, the video has never once captured his attention as other Baby Einstein titles have. I do not recommend this title.
4192	This thing is a piece of junk: My wife ordered one of these for me for x-mas and brand-new out of the box, it didn't work (no oscillation). We packed it up and shipped it back for a refund. She ordered another one and it had the EXACT same problem. Again, brand new out of the box. I have a Delta scroll saw that works well so I have no idea why this product is such junk, but it'll be a cold day in hell before I buy anything else from Delta.
4193	*snore*: I generally enjoy reading stories about other cultures (I usually choose non-fiction), particularly ones with middle-eastern and indian settings. This book looked like it would be interesting; Indian foreigners trying to establish themselves the USA.I found the beginning captivating enough, where the author details the arranged marriage, move to the USA and the birth of the main character. Once the main character grows up however, I lost interest entirely - I cant put my finger on what happens but the momentum of the story comes to a grinding hault. And unfortunately so did my reading. I kept going for a bit, hoping it would improve, but this was not the case.Unfortunately I cant recommend this read.
4194	Hold on for a great ride: This vacuum is great, it has a lot of power so hang on. Very neat at getting into those areas that the larger vacs can't reach. The attachment is very handy, dirty creases look out, your time is up. Easy to clean, I use a real cheap 1" dry paint brush to clean filter. I have tried the Dirt Devil, not even close. Someone said the motor is noisy, if it bothers you try a nice quiet broom.
4195	fit perfectly: The knob fit perfectly in the existing pre-drilled door. It matched the other satin nickel egg-shaped knobs in the house. Very pleased.
4196	I am addicted: First I have to say that only 3 months ago I couldn't name anyone in football (yes it is football not soccer haha). But i started to watch it and my friend recommended this game so I could get to know the players and the teams. Now I am a die-hard Arsenal fan and love the wonderful game and I am addicted to this game. It is an awesome buy and I totally recommend it.
4197	A must-read for adoptive/foster parents: I have internationally adopted teens and this book was most helpful. A doctor suggested it to me, and I in turn have given it to many other to read. Every adoptive parent should read this! It makes sense of how adopted/ foster kids act at times and explains what they're going through mentally. They are often labeled bipolar, but, in reality, they're "just adopted", and struggling each day with the ramifications of that. Excellent book.
4198	An enjoyable read: This was a fun and interesting story. A few twists and turns, a little mystery, some fantasy, a love story on many levels. I quite enjoyed it, and I will be putting it on my list to read again someday. I've never read a mermaid story quite like this, with the mermaids being more like benevolent young/old ladies than anything else. This book was filled with likable characters that I would have liked to have gotten to know even better.
4199	Baby IQ:The World Around Us: My child responds well to the music only DVD. The characters keep her engaged as well as educate her. This is a DVD to watch with your child as you have to verbalize the topics (colors, movement.etc.).
4200	Uncooperative seller: Within weeks of my purchase, the product failed. When switched to the 'auto' position, the motor cycles continuously. I contacted Sisco and they have been uncooperative. They are essentially denying that their product has failed. They want me to ship the product to them at my expense; they will then decide if it is broken. They agreed to send me an email with their return terms, but they have not sent those terms to me. Their one-year warranty is an empty promise!
4201	morisod's melodies: this is the second cd i purchased of morisod's and am equally satified with the purchase.this one is all musical and beautiful beyond words to listen too.
4202	It's My Favorite CD!!!: I love this CD. My Favorite CD!! Heres my views1. Dirty Little Secret: I liked it at first but gets old real fast.2. Stab my Back: I like the music but the lyrics are kinda freaky.3. Move Along: I LOVE THIS SONG!! This never gets old, never!4. It Ends Tonight: Another one of my personal favorites great lyrics.5. Change Your Mind: When I first heard this song on a Wal-Mart Commercial I thought what a happy song when I got the CD I thought What a great song.6.Night Drive: I don't really care for this song good drum rythm.7.11:11pm: I heard this was a bad song so I stayed away from it.8.Dance Inside: This song is tied with Move Along Excellent song.9.Top of The World: Another great song Love The Music Video.10.StraitJacket Feeling: A decent song good rythm.11.I'm Waiting: I never heard of the song until I wrote this review.12. I Can'T Take It: The Rejects Did a great job with a violn!
4203	Excellent: This Cd shows why Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit are truely the BEST! It Hits you with head banging tunes from begining to end. It is everything a rock fan wants in an album and it is done buy the best band in the biz! LIMP BIZKIT!
4204	A Beautiful story: I almost rated this a five just to offset the one that someone else gave it, but I thought it better to be honest. Liam Neeson and Antonio Banderas are, as always, excellent actors and, contrary to what the other commentator said, I would assert that this movie is exactly what it claims to be about ... the other man. The actors very successfully portray the depth of each of their characters, and the plot was paramount to their ability to do so. It was a beautiful story, and brings out how complex people are. There is no black and white here, but neither is there in real life. We all live in the gray area.
4205	Nothing beats good ol' hand wraps...: I purchased these Everlast Evergel Hand Wraps as an alternative to rolling and un-rolling hand wraps, but I learned that these do not do a very good job at providing the right support and stability needed to hit the bags or spar. I went back to using good old hand wraps to do the job. I wouldn't reccommend this item over traditional hand wraps.
4206	From a different point of view...: Most of the time when you find yourself trying to understand another culture, another way of life, on a alien planet, you're trying to understand the aliens. Not the humans. The different point of view in this book is not the hrossa, but the Quaker colonists who are the first of two ships to reach the planet Pennterra. This is a book that seems to explore new ideas of mankind's place within a planet's web of life. It also explores issues of sex, family life, technology, ecology, and evolution. It reminded me of such great novels as JEM by Frederik Pohl and Adiamante by L.E. Modesitt, Jr.Get it used or new, but be warned. It is only for adults.
4207	The other author: provides the most interesting aspect of this chapter . It takes a while to regain interest in the story, but King comes thru. The other author is a confessional that seems to say interesting things. "The Dark Half" again? Bring on the final.
4208	Go With Klein!!!!: Seems well made except for one glaring problem...metal ferrule almost always pulls out of plastic handle when removing shaft to turn it around. This makes the tool all but unusable unless you use it for spare bits for your Klein multi-screwdriver.
4209	Reaching Back To Far: Nea Anna Simone reached back to far in this book. I got confused trying to keep up with all the characters and who's who. This book could have been broken up into about four differnt stories.The book had a good plot, just to much cramed into one book.
4210	Six Months and Happy: When I retired, I decided to grow a beard. I read the Amazon reviews and bought a T980. It is used twice a week to trim a short beard with the length adjustment set on three (my old eyes find the number a little hard to read without glasses). Length adjustment never changes. Turbo mode is never used. I seldom see even a stray hair on my towel or sink. Recharging has been done six times and unplugged when full charge is reached.I bought in spite of some bad reviews. Now, the criticisms baffle me. The purchase was made with confidence, because it came with a 90 day return guarantee. I haven't a clue about reviewers who abandoned or threw away the trimmer when it didn't work for them. It will be more economical than a 5 blade razor if it only lasts about year.It fits my hand well and is easy to use for thorough trimming. I like it!
4211	Disappointing read: I am in the middle of the book and am disappointed. The main character, honestly, I can't remember her name, talks low-class and acts so dumb. This book could have been so much better if she didn't talk the way she does. Did the author really 'believe' that an academic at a college speaks this way? In the opening pages I couldn't get past that she mentally rolled her eyes at college students who would ask a question. How dare they ask questions?! I think she is supposed to be the disappointed-by-life modern woman. The author could have written her so much better!
4212	comprehensive and very updated . fundamental historical review: In modern days its fundamental to know the past to understand the present. This film is very comprehensive and very updated . It is a fundamental historical review
4213	Just not for me: Hardly any photo's. recipes not what i was looking for. I was looking for recipes for a crowd. Returned book.
4214	Great Sounding Live Album!!!!: This live album has a great sound--better than Live at the Fillmore or the double album recorded at the same time--half studio/half live It sounds like it was recorded at the Fillmore around 1974 --Clem Clempson was the guitar player along with Steve Marriot, Jerry Shipley, Greg Ridley and the Rasperrys (Mary Clayton and company) The only problem with it is there are no linear notes--it doesn't tell you when it was recorded or who is in the band and no song listing. But if you are a Humble Pie freak like me you can tell from listening----- the musicians and time period. The sound is great--better than Live At Fillmore but anything with Peter Frampton in the band is equal to or better than this one--only the clarity and sound is better. From a collector's standpoint-- you have no info on the cd but you must get it anyway. It was recorded a little after Frampton left the band--A must have anyway!!!!!!!
4215	I was pleased: It looks real. Slightly smaller foliage height and width than I thought, but sufficient enough to meet the purpose I bought it for. Shipping package was great to ensure no damage enroute. I was pleased enough to order more plants from this company and, again, I was pleased with the product. It also arrived promptly. This is a value for quality product in my view and recommend it. For the price,it looks great. I am sure other vendors would have a much less "real" looking plant at this price.
4216	Much better books with tactics available: This book I am sure sells because of the name of Bobby Fischer on it. But in reality it is a poorly written book on simple checkmate tactics. Not much material.If you are thinking of getting a good book, for beginners I recommend the Chess For Juniors book. If you are just beyond then beginning stage then maybe Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors by Hays, or even much better yet the new book called WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS (this book is great!) should make this Bobby Fischer doesn't really teach chess book look bad.
4217	!! WOW !!: What a book. It is so hot it will burn you. A bit of caution, only atempt to read THE LADY'S TUTOR if you have a cold shower near by. With that said, I highly recomend it.
4218	South African power converter: This plug worked all over South Africa. I used it to recharge batteries and run my computer.
4219	Wish it were possible to leave zero stars.: These things are junk. They look cool, but the arm snapped in half after about 5 uses. I read the other reviews about them breaking, and thought for the price if they last 6 months that'll be fine, but they didn't even last 6 weeks!
4220	Why so exspensive?: Why on earth are they charging $88.99 for this DVD? I wanted to order my grandaughter a Wiggles DVD but I did not want to take out a second mortgage to pay for it!
4221	Great for the small wrist: Just as one would expect at a considerable savings. It's a small watch for the dainty wrist and very classy.
4222	Very nicely done: I recomend it. It is very nicely done. Good clean storyline. It shows the struggle between hard choices with the results.
4223	Libraries Rock!: In response to the previous reviewers' surprise at finding this CD at a public library - many libraries have GREAT collections of CDs, and I encourage everyone to take a look for themselves. I am a librarian and part of my job is to select CDs for our collection; we have over 4,500 CDs to choose from, and we're not that big of a public library. You'll be surprised to see all of the funky, hip recordings at your local library!
4224	20th Century Masters: Best of Antonio Carlos Jobim: A wonderful collection of the quiet delicate Jobim compositions and a reminder of how the bossa nova rhythym washes over us like a "Wave".
4225	Welcome return for Hewitt: Jennifer Love Hewitt's latest single is by far the best she has released.Hewitt departs from the teen pop that she sang on her first 2 CD's and shows that she has grown up quite a lot.The song is one of those that anyone can relate to.She is not like all the other singer/songwriters out there.Love sings a different kind of tune.I look forward to the release of the album to see just how much Love has grown as an artist,which I am sure will be awesome.
4226	Awesome value for the average person: The picture quality on these DVDs is good. Although there are no extras I'm not buying the DVD to hear some guy talk about how much he loved a certain scene. If all you need is the shows themselves with perfectly fine quality sound and image then this is for you. It doesn't do surround sound and it may not be high definition but with the sixty bucks you save you can buy two copies and play the other one on a TV behind you.
4227	Never used: I bought these with high hopes of using them with my son. I honestly never remembered I had them on the shelf and hardly used them. My friends love them and got a lot of use out of them.
4228	Cool...: Love this case and so glad I bought it. Besides just plain looking cool it's really rugged and I never have to worry about knocking my Zune around. If they would have included a velcro arm strap that would thread through instead of the belt clip...it would have gotten 5 stars.Highly recommend it!
4229	Dr. Bronner doesn't agree with my skin: If I use this product in a bath soak more than once in a row I get itchy skin. So does my daughter. In fact, she gets a reaction after using just once. We're both fair skinned red heads. It's too expensive to use for general cleaning. (It does keep the bathtub clean) It may be a great product for some people. Just not me.
4230	Not Good: I enjoy watching movies and I like just about any genre, but this is one of the worst movies I have seen. The entire movie is one afternoon with two couples. I rented it because of the stars, but I am so very sorry I did. It is not worth the .99 or $1.99 I paided for it. Save yourself the 2 hours it took to watch it.
4231	Wings Of Fear: This was a great book. I don't really wanna tell anything else cuz i might ruin it but Nancy Drew has really started at a better case solving ditorial.
4232	simply amazing: I am so impressed. No way to even get close to max volume..>! Very clear. Took 2 mins. to set up.Best Computer speakers I have ever heard. Low lows, and high highs.
4233	Great book about an exceptional man (by an excellent writer): This is a fascinating and exceptionally in-depth book about Einstein and his thinking. Not only does Walter Isaacson clear up a lot of misconceptions about Einstein, he also does a fairly good job of explaining much of Einsteins thinking in ways that I can almost fully understand.Great book and good read about an exceptional man by an excellent writer.
4234	MTV CLIP: THis is nothing more than a overextended MTV clip ( a bad one, by the way). When I heard that it was Drew Barrymore who wanted to make this picture, I knew something would go wrong !!! This movie is so silly and dumb, and even being so it still finds people who love it !!
4235	Tasty but still somewhat stale...What a Babe!!!: I share some of the feelings of similar reviewers - I wish there were more photos in here not previously published. Still this book is a great collection of some of her best photos - including the outstanding Demarchelier nudes. It's also spiced up with some great comments by Laetitia herself, although I was rather disappointed by the comments on her love life: darnit, and I hoped she was saving herself for me! But THE BIGGEST LETDOWN was the low quality paper it was printed on, and they certainly could have included a lot more great photos. I realize they probably wanted to keep the price low, but I'm sure that with as many devoted fans as she has they could have produced a $60 product a still made a mint. DIS-LUI BIENDES CHOSES AMOUR
4236	The top medical text currently in print.: If you are sick, with a major condition, this is the top [printed] resource available on rebuilding health & vitality. If you are interested in going into medicine, you'll probably choose Naturopathic Medicine after reviewing this book. All medical schools, healthfood stores, pharmacies, health clinics & hospitals will be using this book as a reference in the near future. Welcome to the future of medicine...... safe, natural, nontoxic, inexpensive, and very effective...Naturopathic Medicine.
4237	Might be good if it worked!!: I have yet to be able to hear even 1 song on the player, even normal CD's don't work - everything sounds like the chipmunks. Trying to deal with casio support is a joke - nothing on their web site (web site listed in manual doesn't even exist) and only 1 number in the manual that is open for 8 hours a day monday-friday. After 1 hour on hold (wasting my lunch hour at work) they said it is defective and they can't help without having the player sent to them or to return it where it was purchased from. I feel like I just wasted my money and time trying to deal with the problem - it is not worth it.
4238	Missing important part: I haven't decided to keep or not- because the item came without the thermometers that are pictured here.The thermometers are supposed to tell you that that waffle is cooked, and I am afraid that without them,this becomes another kitchen item the will never get used.
4239	Forever Great: When this record came out in 1967, it immediately went on to my top ten list of favorite records. Many changes have been made to that list over the years, but this one has always remained on it. The remastered CD is beautiful. There were a lot of great records made in the late 60's and early 70's. Love was a group that did not get a lot of airplay, but deserved to be heard. If you have never listend to Forever Changes, it is well worth the purchase. Arthur Lee created one great record.
4240	Gomi gone wild!!!!: Bushido 7 is the show where Gomi loses it against Alzeredo. Phil Braoni makes his Pride Debut against Minowa (a great fight). Hayato Mach Sakurai makes his lightweight Pride debut. Gono fight Crosley Gracie. Plus much more. I was told that this may have been the best of the Bushidos other than Bushido: The Tournament, and I think it's the best of the first 7.BTW: Did I mention it that Gomi loses it against Alzeredo (but doesn't lose the match)?5 stars
4241	Cover to cover advertising, virtually zero content: Once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover. Unfortunately they've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising. As the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual "content" in about an hour. The rest is advertising and BS. This magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago. Just let it die already like it's supposed to.
4242	Terrible book: Weak plot, bad main events, very bad ending.: I was forced to read this book for my English class and didn't have a problem with it when I started it. In the beginning of the first chapter she was in sixth grade and by the end she was alright all grown up, given a child, and had left home. The next sixteen chapters went by slow and boring. I had to force myself to keep reading this dull, poorly written book. I think that it could have been extremely more intresting and should not be given the credit that it has been given so far. I would strongly urge you to NOT read this book.
4243	Quiet is a relative term: I purchased the Whisper 100 about three weeks ago to drive both tubes on an undergravel filter in a 30 gal tank. I was replacing a Whisper 40 that wasn't able to drive two tubes. The 100 was noticeably louder than the 40, but still OK in my living room. You could tell it was there, but you could tune it out. Until a couple of days ago. The whisper turned into a rattling hum on the left side. Adjusting the airflow made no difference. I had to disconnect the tube. That did the trick, until today when the right side started going south. So I unplugged it and now have two separate pumps (a whisper 40 and some other tiny one I got at Walmart) running the two tubes. Both of them together are quieter than the 100 was when it first came out of the box.I give it a 2 instead of a 1, because I could probably send it in and get it fixed, but at this price it's just not worth the trouble.
4244	This Disc Is Awesome !!!!!: This is easily my favorite disc to be released in the mid 90's, It ROCKS, but it also displays a musical integrity that few bands ever achieve, I really like the mixture of Rock, Metal, Blues, and Jazz sounds they mix so brilliantly. There is not a bad song on this whole disc, I can listen to this from start to finish and never get bored with it. You have Warren Haynes great guitar playing and gutsy vocals, Allen Woody's tight bass sound and Matt Abts powerhouse drums all mixed together making a big heavy sound, a definite MASTERPIECE. If anyone who reads this review likes hard rockin' blues music this is a MUST have for your collection.
4245	Gift for loved one.: I purchased this movie as a gift for a loved one. I have not watched it. Thus, I can not comment on the actual movie. I'm giving it 5 stars because my loved one watched it and said that it was a "great" movie. So, I guess that warrants a 5-star rating.
4246	Way-below average white band!: I couldn't have been more disappointed by this disc. I had read reviews (online and elsewhere)about how funky the JTQ were - what I heard was poorly executed, kitschy ripoffs of sincere and soulful music. These guys may OWN the records and the gear, but they either can't use it, or don't get it! For the REAL deal, I recommend: "Superfly" and "Hot Buttered Soul" by Curtis Mayfield and Issac Hayes, respectively; these two invented wah-wah driven soul. Steve Winwood's Hammond work on Hendrix' "Electric Ladyland", and Vanilla Fudge's self-titled first release; TRUE psychedelic organ. Finally, "Outhipped" by Barbara Dennerlein, and Ricky Peterson's playing on Sanborn's "Upfront";excellent, skillful representations of modern B-3 funk. Don't give the JTQ your money...like I did!
4247	If you are interested in Tiger history , , , , , , ,: My brother-in-law is a sports fantantic. He once worked front office for the Detroit Tigers baseball team. His wife thought this would be a terrific book for his recent birthday. Although, I have not heard from him since he received the gift, I believe he enjoyed the book.
4248	encourages the lying deceiving monkey in all of us: Being involved with German programs I have seen this film twice. The constant theme of cheating on one's partner is useless entertainment that is embarrassing to watch. The movie may give you some insight to German society of the DDR, but otherwise it just lowers the intelligence of the viewer.Watch Goodbye Lenin, or Mephisto, or anything with quality instead.
4249	Gratuitous violence overshadows some great potential: I tried to view this highly recommended film with an open mind. I was told "the accents are great", "the acting is wonderful", "you are transported right to Minnesota". I tried to go along with the crowd. I really did. But you know what, enough is enough. The novelty is gone just about the time the first close-range bullet splatters the first brain. This could have been an interesting, satirical movie. Instead it was mind-numbing and violent. It was for the pulp fiction crowd. Perhaps blowing someone's head off, or shooting them in the back is entertaining. I missed that point. McDormand and Macy give great performances, likable and disturbing, but please...leave something for our imaginations. Make it thoughtful. The number of times I have heard someone ask me "but wasn't the woodchipper funny" makes me think about a lot of individuals trying to justify something. Stand up for yourselves, go see a good movie.
4250	Lump of Coal is a Diamond of the Rough: I first heard Lump of Coal when I was a college DJ back in the early 1990s. Like Judy Collins these artists make perfectly executed skill lift the meanest images of desperation into praise of that which is beyond, above, and within us all. It is easy to feel there is some grand art in vaulted cathedrals and back-lit stained glass windows echoing with well seasoned choirs near towering altars. The magnificent earthy tones of this album help one see the altars in the hearts of those the songs describe - those who feel forgotten by high ritual and better fortune; Those whom He came to heal.
4251	The only complete Ruggles cycle...: ..and it's unavailable. I haven't heard this in a long time. I wish that this would get released on CD, or better yet, that MTT would re-record these fabulous pieces with the San Francisco Symphony. Ruggles is a neglected treasure of American music!
4252	Beautiful: Words fail me when it comes to expressing the exquisite beauty of this CD. Webster's sound is lush, soulful, and enchanting. The smoothness and depth of his vibrato tones are akin to the full-bodied humming from a great singer. Jazz Round Midnight is my lullaby that soothes away the stresses of the day.
4253	Please do not buy this book: As many other reviewers have mentioned, these recipes as originally formulated contain onions, which are toxic to cats.If you are thinking, So what? I can leave to onions out! The new edition doesn't have onions in the recipes, so it must be fine!PLEASE reconsider. This book was obviously written by someone who did not know the first thing about feline nutrition. It just as obviously never underwent any kind of editing by anyone who knew anything about feline nutrition. This is not a small problem: Nutritional deficiencies can cause VERY serious and irreversible health problems in cats. (Would you trust a nutritionist who recommended giving your kids arsenic?) Please find another book, or better yet, talk to your veterinarian.
4254	Good techniques to incorporate to your style.: I was surprised to see how 64 pages could be filled wth lots of valuable information. All of which are short and to the point. In the clay section he offers two different clay recipes for each type of clay discribed. In the project section, each project is throughly explained with "how to" photographs. Most of the projects are worth the time doing since the techniques can be incorporated into the potters style.
4255	'Nipple Show': To start off, I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra. The material is very thin (2 layers thin). Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage. There are no 'cups' in this sports bra. Secondly, yes it does have adjustable straps, but they are velcro and fasten under the straps. I like to do a mix of excercises, but mostly cardio. I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on. It offerd moderate support, the ladies did some bouncing. I didn't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity. I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C. It had an ok fit. Not too tight, but not too loose either.(That is with it fastened as tight as it would go.) If I were going to keep it, I think a 36C would fit better. Overall, it is fine if you don't mind nipple show, a few bounces, and the velcro straps. If you want compression and minimal bounce, take a pass.
4256	Not enough illustrations: Johnson writes a very opinionated book which is refreshing, although I didn't always agree with him. I would have given 4 stars but there are not nearly enough illustrations. Something critical in an art history book. He often referred to works which I'm not familair with and were not illustrated. I found this to be very frustrating.
4257	Book Purchase: The "used" book arrived in great condition; it was virtually unread, no dog eared pages or tears. It's a slow read but I really enjoying it.
4258	Disappointing: For someone who already believes, this book is likely to provide further "evidence" for their beliefs.This book won't convince a non-believer, however.As many reviewers have already stated, this wasn't as much about Don's experience in heaven as it was about his suffering.If found it inspirational on a human level, but I remain uncertain about what happens after death.
4259	perfect answer for hiding extra rolls: purchased this for powder room that has no cabinets to hide extra paper. the brushed stainless looks great and it holds 3 rolls of large size toilet paper. arrived quickly and was well packed. highly recommend.
4260	"He's the man": I am a fan of the man!!!!! I loved the CD the "ego has landed" and he sure has especially with his song "No Regrets"it has that relaxing dreamy affect. I thought that "angels" had a powerful sound that makes you feel protected.If your feeling like the wild sixties "Man machine" is a great happy tune. This music could be for the young thirty year olds as well as the teenagers. It is time that we had music like this. I hope that I can get the chance to see him in concert. I love your mysterious look also Robbie and thanks for such a wonderful CD. Dawn Gannon
4261	Very informative: I am a new owner of half an acre of lawn. I didn't know anything about lawn care until I read this book. This is not "Scotts" infomercial, it is packed with enough information for you to start caring for your lawn, whether or not you will use Scotts products.
4262	stellar: Knew, from the quality of the musicians playing on this album it should be good and was not disappointed in the slightest. Always enjoy a good bass line, and Dave School's fat bottom end lays down and holds tight through out all the songs, keeping it tight and driving it through. Enjoy.
4263	Sweeney Todd Wanna Be: Saw David Hasselhoff in this Bomb On HBO, Dr. J,and Mr Hyde,The Story Of A Split Personality(One fictional character Played by One Hasbeen T.V. Actor),And Both Of Em Frigging Awfull.Espically The Meltdown Scene Where Dr.J Keeps Going Between Himself And Hyde,Supremely Over THE TOP!!! Of Course It Was A Massive Sucess!
4264	DAMAGED DVD (BAD BURNED / COPY): The DVD came damaged. I was only able to play the first 15 minutes and then the screen frozed. Tried cleaning it, replaying it, but it kept freezing at the same scene. Content (of what I was able to see) seems OK.
4265	Great show, dropped the ball on the DVD's: This season 1 set could have been great, but its ruined by the non-anamorphic transfer. The picture looks like garbage, and makes it difficult to watch. Still a great show, and the season 1 DVD's would get 5 stars if they hadn't been so lazy about the transfer. This isn't 1999, DVD's should all be anamorphic.
4266	too mushy: It makes Peter Horry and Francis Marion to mushy. I wanted the fighting side not the staring into each others eyes and appearing to fall in love scenero.Peter Horry was not pleased with it and told the Rev. to do what he wished with it and it was printed.This could have been addedlater but for the beginning it turned me off.
4267	Perfect Pot rack: This rack fit our space perfectly it has been incredibly practical. It saves tons of cupboard space and makes it easier to find things too. Looks great above our rolling kitchen cart.
4268	U2 is finally back on track...: Wow!!!! This is an awesome U2 CD. I still say that The Joshua Tree is the best U2 album ever, but this is a close second or third. Beautiful Day is an awesome song, and so is Walk On and Stuck in a Moment... . This is definitely worth buying. A big improvement over Achtung Baby and Pop, which was a decline in U2's greatness. BUY THE ALBUM!!!! IT DIDN'T WIN THREE GRAMMY'S FOR NOTHING!!!!!
4269	A delightful love story!: This is a wonderful story about how Sander and Gastonia fall in love. Do not skip this book. You won't be disappointed!
4270	Ordered for my granddaughter: It was a christmas present for her new apartment. It looks good in her closet and it was exactly was she wanted . Good product
4271	the great fatsby: my brother had this album back in the early '70's. it blew me away. i recorded "don't burn me" on one of my favorite R&R reel to reel tapes many years ago. i have not been able to find this cd anywhere. thank you amazon. this is a "killer" piece of work. sit back, crank it up to '11', and enjoy!
4272	does not fit the C-7000 zoom: Does not fit the olympus C-7000 zoom. mjor bummer as the list of cameras in the ad states that it does.
4273	Simply must own: An amazing album by a sadly under-appreciated band. Every track on here is incredible. Buy it and love it. End of story.
4274	Great movie, but poor quality dvd: I love the Anne of Green Gables movies, but for the PRICE I just paid for this movie, the DVD was not entirely worth it!!!! I have a problem with the sloppy packaging, no inserts, nothing but a 2 sided DVD. And the DVD does not contain CHAPTERS, so you can't just skip to different scenes like you can with most any other DVD. That seems like necessary feature for such a lengthy move, don't you think? Like I said, love the movie, just disappointed in the dvd version.
4275	High Quality: This is a great high quality bag and has a spot for name tag. Keeps things cold and hot as described.
4276	not a keeper: The major problem I had with this book is the hero: he's not likeable or sympathetic. I really wanted to say to the heroine, "Dump him. You can find someone who will really appreciate you!"
4277	3 out of 5 aint bad???: Ok if you don't mind digging them back out every couple of years. 2 of the 5 we put in two years ago started leaking at the drain valve which is 4 feet deep in the ground in our case. Incidently the 3 that don't leak we hardley use. I am looking for a different brand.
4278	A good book for beginners: I just went through the book, the most important part i liked is its language which is very welcoming for a beginner. I know lots of graphic softwares very well, but unware of some basic designing fundamentals. This book showed me the way. Though the samples in the book is few and not very interesting but has lots of basic information written in compact form so that a beginner can refer back any time. The book is broken down into basic topics a designer should know and its related subtopics. I liked its exercises at end of each chapter. May not be interesting to a person who is already a professional, but its a very handy book for anybody who want to become a designer with limited knowledge about it. I think one should go through it before trying out very hi-end designing books.
4279	Human Friendly / Dogs worst nightmare: While this product has helped save us a large amount of money on trimming my dogs nails. He usually will hate us for about an hour afterwords because he does not like the sound of it. Other than that though, it was been a wonderful product, it is easy to use you can adjust the speed with just the turn of a nob and unlike most products today it has a nice long cord! One issue that I have found is the sanding disk likes to slide down sometimes onto the chrome part. But I have found if I position my thumb right on the edge of it I can keep it there (No it does not hurt). Outside of that its a great product and it sure beats paying $17 a visit to have his nails done.
4280	Why buy the Mac version for $10 more?: Amazon sells the PC formatted Maxell disks for $10 less for the same 7-pack. Just reformat them on your Mac ZIP drive and save the $10 for something else!
4281	Three cups of hope...: This book renewed my hope that man can co-exist peacefully and respectfully...a rich cultural exchange lesson and a gripping story. Mortenson for President!DCW, Sneads Ferry, NC
4282	GOOD BAD AND THE UGLY- Friday the 13th the series: The Good:Super hot shots of Robey (white wife-beater tank top, no bra = yummy)The Bad: this show has not aged all that well, however still sorta enjoyableThe Ugly : the transfer, the overall quality of these episodes a/v wise is very below par.
4283	eh...: I got this box set and read all the books. The premise of the series is extraordinarily good, and could have been not only sexually hot but philosophically and literarily deep. However, the execution was not good. Mostly, the series starts off decently but just gets more and more boring as it goes.
4284	Very useful tool: This tool is very handy. The cherry juice tends to go everywhere so the little clear plastic tube placed below helps, however, be sure to do this over a trash can. The cherries I bought were enormous and some of the seeds got stick and had to be popped out of the pitter by hand because they were too large to fit through the device. Most worked very well and I think I just had some unusually big cherries.
4285	Sizing is NOT as advertised!: This costume looked really cute in the picture, and it said it would fit infants sizes 6-12 months. Well, my daughter is 9 months old and she was swimming in it! The hat literally fit on MY head! This "baby" costume would be better suited to a five year old. I will be returning it.
4286	It Just Doesn't Work!: I bought this for our daughter's first birthday as she loves tub time. It worked for about 3 seconds the first time and then didn't for several weeks until the entire bottom portion got wet, then it mysteriously started working. It never works on the single mode, but will on the "orchestral" mode where the whole band plays, but the entire band plays only if the bottom of the toy is wet (hey, that's not in the directions). Of course, it ALWAYS works when I take a shower.Should have read the reviews first.
4287	wonderful easy recipes: This is one of the newer releases from Lerner in this FINE line of cookbooks. They are supposed to be for kids, but they are great and people of all ages will love them. These cookbooks are not big, but they give a wide array of dishes to try and give sample menus for you to serve to your family and guests. The Harira recipe is very good and the Egyptian coconut cake is amazing! The ingredients are realistic and available and the directions are not too complex. Anyone with basic cooking skills will get good results.
4288	Mislabeled product: Its decent kit for regular every ports. I wanted Mini USB A pin which the description says that they have.. but they clearly dont. The review is based on the product description not the quality of the product itself. I actually liked the way it was setup.. I also did not like the customer experience with JR when I tried to sell it.
4289	C-Murder is TRU to the game: C-Murder's "Life Or Death" is one of the best No Limit has ever had. It's filled with tracks and just about everyone of them is good. "Soldiers" is one of the best featuring No Limit's best rapper Mystical, and you can't help but to jam to "Akickdoe" which featured one of the south's best, UGK. My only problem is the same old tired problem I always have, Master P sounds like he's having a fit blasting out 'ughs' every other second. I thought C-Murder, Bun B, and Pimp C were going to have to stop rapping and call him a paramedic.
4290	great for our Shiba: we love it too. It works great on our Shiba Inu, a dog with a thick undercoat that sheds like crazy in Spring. It works great on our cats too and even our very grumpy cat tolerates it. I would suggest, if you live in the country or a community that doesn't have rules against it... just leave the xtra pet fur outside for little critters and birds to use in their nests. They really appreciate things like that.
4291	MADE IN CHINA: I only ordered this as my search criteria in Amazon showed that it was "made in the USA" and it is not. I will be returning it.
4292	not om yoga FAST YOGA !!!: i love yoga and am welling to try new styles of yoga I had borrow this DVD from a studio I was not happy - i guess I like to take my time with yoga and really feel everything ! I have done yoga only at the studio with a group and i wanted to take my practice home So I thought this DVD would help well it wasn't helpful they rushed everything it wasn't even POWER YOGA! They didn't let you enjoy the breathing or letting you stay in poses they had a like 3 ppl and the teacher and they went so fast! Also the meditation was NOT meditation it was this FAST 2min breathing and then they moved on!!! I wouldn't pay for this DVD
4293	much better: This season was much better than season 3 which I thought sucked. One problem I see is the increasing similarities of spoofs between RC and Family Guy. If you do not watch Family Guy then the jokes are original but if you do I can't get over how Seth green, McFarlane copy each other's jokes, it's to the point of plagiarism. There is a spoof about McFarlane in this season so I'm sure they share material. Other than that the lohan and the hills jokes were the funniest IMO.
4294	just ok: Timbaland has bounced back and in a big way over the past year. so he put out this Album which while showcases his tendencys towards beats and grooves, it also shows off the fact he has never really written a memorable song. he is more known for Grooves and beats. this album also shows that he is better suited behind the scenes for other acts as to doing his own thing because his limitations as a artist in his own right are there for the hearing. a few interesting things here and there,but nothing memorable. Timbaland does have some good ideas,but he doesn't get the most out of his own self as he seems to get out of other artists he works with.
4295	Patience will be rewarded: This book is considered one of Adams' weaker works. Readers will find it maddeningly moralistic, pompus and self important. It follows the intrepid adventures of two dogs who have escaped from an animal research station in the Lake Country, U.K.But listen - I nearly threw this book across the room a half dozen times when reading it. I've seen the film, loved that, and I was determined to get through the muddy waters of the book. It was worth it. The last forty-some pages of this book are pure genius, absolutely riveting narrative. If you can make it through to the end, you will be rewarded with edge of your seat, nail biting tension. John Grisham has got nothing on this guy.In short, read this book. READ IT! Do not skip to the end. Be prepared to hate it. I did. Act Three will leave you breathless, and isn't it all the more worthwhile when you've had to work to get to the end? I think so. Thank you, Richard Adams!
4296	Tiesto has lost his marbles: A huge Tiesto fan of the past, I have to say I was incredibly dissapointed. A few nice vocals but thats it. Anyone who rates this highly hasn't been listening to trance much. This is just not the tiesto we use to know. Success has definitely gone to his head. He has sold out to the mainstream crowd. His trance sounds more like pop now. Also it seems he is trying to incorporate some new style or something with his choice of some of the sounds and it sounds incredibly annoying. Tiesto needs to find his marbles and get back to the real sounds that made him no.1
4297	Good sequence: The sequence of the first book is excellent in the second book. This means as well as in the first book that you'll let your imagination fly within the book's story. I admire J.K.R for her smart writing. However in this book the heroine was Hermione not Harry.
4298	Winning in Life: Jack Welsch does a great job in his book by giving real life examples to move a business forward. The book illustrates the broad spectrum of business and includes the need for balance. I recommend this book to all career levels. Brett Vanderwater, MBA, CIA, CMA, CTP
4299	A story not yet at ended.: It's perplexing to discover the events going on in the deep South as I was growing up in a fairly integrated Northern community, oblivious to the cruelty of that time. Ms. Nicholas does a credible job of depicting events of those times, perhaps giving hope for better racial understanding.
4300	GREAT SONGS AND A LESSON IN NOT ALWAYS WINNING: It's hard not to like every veggie tale song. This collection is nice because it is the very best songs and a story line of three characters that carry you from one song to the next. During the countdown we learn a lesson in being happy with what you get (in this case 2nd place) rather than trying to cheat to win first place.
4301	DON'T BUY THIS BOOK.: I thought this would be I reasonable book about aura reading. I was DEAD WRONG. This is a "match with your mate" color guide with auras. Very similar to the little matching Chinese astrology charts you see in Chinese returants. A complete waste of money.
4302	Waters or Gilmour?: Roger demonstrates his ability to put on a full blown arena rock concert. Unabashed showmanship is his forte and this DVD captures that very well. Excellent sound and video. This is completely opposite of his former bandmate David Gilmour's DVD David Gilmour-In Concert where David puts on an intimate and very musical show. Any yet, it's not Pink Floyd. How could it be? While Roger's band is skilled and puts on a great show, the vocals and guitar of Doyle Bramhall II don't contain the same smooth eloquence of Gilmour. In the same manner, Roger's voice is sorely missed on Gilmour's rendition of Comfortably Numb. Both Waters' and Gilmour's DVD's remind us old Pink Floyd fans (I was there in '73 for Dark Side of the Moon) that it's over, but we can remember how it was thanks to these two exeptional recordings. Buy them both!
4303	2 Stars if anyone else 1 Star for Metallica: METALLICA - St. Anger-And it would be even less if not for the song St.Anger + Frantic which are both mediocre, but not horrible.Also the Drums are aweful... Vocals are weak... And like everyone said "Where are the guitar solos???"Jason, even though not a new member, is the only intelligent one left in the band. Oh yeah wait he left the band... That's what makes him Intelligent.Bob Rock deserves to be seriously injured. Then forced to listed to St.Anger / Load / Re-Load for the rest of eternity.-1 STARIF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:"Was this review helpful?"
4304	Mind-numbingly Awful: There is absolutely nothing to recommend this book. The idea is old and has been done several times before, to much better effect. The characters are two-dimensional, dull and unreal- if the author knows anything about humanity, he's not showing it. The actual plot (fragmented, dull and thin as it is) ends at least 100 pages before the book itself, maddeningly dragging on with an unfinished idea from much earlier on, finally finishing on a note that strains to be profound but just comes off random, stupid and unnecessary. Save your money, time and mental peace that comes from not wasting the first two on a worthless example of thoroughly incompetant writing.
4305	Ruby Fluid: This product came shipped in a hand sized plastic container with a small lid, like a bottle of alcohol may come in. The product image showed a metal looking tin, normally if something does not come as advertised would give a lower but I must say the plastic bottle is better for my use. Just know upfront.Like the name suggests, this fluid is redish. I would call it pink. Easy to see.According to the manufacturer the flux should be used at 95 - 315 C or 200 - 600 F.
4306	Awesome stuff: Expensive, but this is one of the few products that is worth it. You only have the one face, take care of it. You don't have to use much either, it goes on smooth and your face is so soft afterwards.
4307	SURPRISE USE FOR STAIN REMOVAL: We always come back to Simple Solution for our dog's accidents (or upset tummies). However, today, I crashed a bottle of red wine on a pretty absorbent wooden floor. The stain was still there after I wiped and washed. It came to me to try Simple Solution. Amazing, it took up almost all the stain after soaking the area, rubbing it in a bit and putting paper towels over it. Came back in an hour and it was nearly miraculous. The stain came up to the paper towels.Just thought readers might be interested.
4308	The Best - No Comparison: I'm on my 5th ReplayTV. The 5000 series is the cream-of-the-crop. Even better than the newer 5500 series, which dropped the auto commercial advance feature. That alone is HUGE. Replay is way better than Tivo in quality, features, and ease of use. My brother went the Tivo route, and he likes it. Tivo is always playing catch-up (Ethernet, etc..). I'll stick with the leader of the pack. If you only buy ONE A/V item, you owe it to yourself to try the ReplayTV. Try to get the 5000 series before they are all gone. My auto-advance works perfectly 95% of the time, and I never have to use the quick-skip buttons. It truly is amazing!!
4309	Beautiful and Flimsy: I've had this set for around 6 months now. Two pieces, a spoon and a fork have already broken. Much of it has to do with the tiny plastic balls at the top of the flatware. I will not buy this set again.It looks adorable, however, for everyday use, it's no good. They will look beautiful for about 3 months and then start to break and the silver on the top will wear off and the colors will become dull and lifeless. I suggest buying a different set.
4310	Horrible: This keyboard is probably the worst keyboard ever created. It is way to hard to type on because of the small size of the keys. You'd have be crazy to buy it.
4311	DO NOT BUY THESE: The chairs are poor quality and the cushions came ripped. There are loose parts jingling in the chairs. Don't buy!!!!!!!!!!!!
4312	Get this book off the shelves: How can we still be selling a book that advocates child abuse? No one should buy this book.
4313	The best method!!: I read this book out of desperation to get my 9 month old to sleep through the night, wean him from nighttime feeds and transition him from my bed to his crib. In 4 nights, he was sleeping 11 hours uninterrupted and 2 naps a day for at least an hour. It's like a miracle! We're finally well rested and I have all this time to get others things done. This book and this "method" really works as long as you are consistent. The authors are very supportive of us parents which I needed, and the instructions are simple. I also appreciated learning more about sleep for babies that are my baby's age. I read several other books (Baby Wise, Sleeping Through the Night, Dr. Sears) and couldn't teach my baby to sleep with them. This is the one and only book you'll need!
4314	Stand Up and Cheer!: This is a quite remarkable first novel. Chaim Bertman tells the tale of a young man who desperately wants to write a novel, and changes cities (and women) in his quest. In telling his tale Bertman uses the magic of words to powerfully evoke scenes, cities and people--and the travail of the would-be novelist as pure "observer." At one point tourists are called "pirates with cameras." Bertman creates for us a "pirate with a pencil" we care about. But Bertman himself is no pirate, and he takes the reader on a very worthwhile voyage--one which ends with the possibility of redemption. Take the trip.
4315	Just as advertised: I bought this for my father for fathers day. He is an avid classic car collector and is looking at branching into collecting gas pumps to display alongside his cars. He loved the book. He found it very informative and was easily able to recognize pumps that he has already looked at buying and was able to establish their value and origins. The book is well researched and illustrated and easy to maneuver through. Thanks.
4316	Light and Rugged: For such a light hiking pole, it is incredibly rugged and built very well. I like the spring-loaded shock absorber and the detachable top post, so that it can also be used as a camera monopod. At this price, I bought two and it's still 50% less than a pair of name-brand poles. This is a must-have piece of equipment for outdoor photographers.
4317	What a let-down!: This book was a disappointment! The patterns for mittens, socks, and scarves are nothing special and can be found anywhere. The pattern for the felted cat/dog blanket calls for 4-8 skeins of Brown Sheep Lamb's Pride wool for each (at a cost of approx $7/skein) I think my local animal shelter would be much happier if I donated an old blanket and $56 worth of pet food instead of one felted blanket. The kid's hat with flaps looked a bit "off" with the flaps small and oddly placed. And the booties don't stay on.
4318	Really good retro Christmas Music: So glad I bought this. Dean Martin's voice is the best on the this album. We played this more than any other Christmas album this year.
4319	That one star you see is really just a splattered bug: Give this absolute garbage one star? Fat chance, Nelly-boy.This is a prime example of everything that is wrong with the music industry nowadays -- not to mention with society in general. That's really all that needs to be said.At least Nelly got one thing right: His ever-present facial bandage is a perfect metaphor for the type of so-called "music" of which he and so many other talentless goons are purveyors -- it is a festering wound that has yet to heal.
4320	Yawn ... this book put me to sleep!: I had the bad luck to be stuck on a 5-hour flight with only this book. All I can say is that is was one of the better sleep aids I have tried. Acording to the summary in the jacket, it was supposed to chronicle the lives of some of the people who were devastated by the South Fork flood in 1889.What the blurbs and reviews fail to mention is that the flood doesn't actually happen until the last few pages of the book. Leading up to the flood, the reader is dragged through a few hundred pages of vapid, shallow anecdotes of the lead characters' lives, which are at best difficult to follow and at worst utterly mind-numbing.I forced myself to finish it for lack of anything better to do, but would not recommend it to any but the most starved for diversion.And, by the way, I am a native Pennsylvanian, so I really expected better. Unless you are really in the mood to yawn, save your money and borrow this dog from the library!
4321	Not so great, but works well enough for the price...: This monitor I received as a baby shower gift and I hate it! It has horrible static. If you walk around it or get too close it gets worse. If the phone rings same thing. I didn't expect to much from it, but I must say I can hear my son pretty well, and I like the fact that I can see the red lights. They help me to determine if he is just groaning and searching for his thumb, or if he is actually in distress. Great concept, needs some work.
4322	Dangerous typecasting about muslims: another stupid movie who mix typecastings about religion, culture, individuals behaving ...nothing to compare with reality.It is as dangerous as the islamic danger they want to show.Pathetic
4323	I LIKE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC, BUT . . . .: Nothing outstanding. I'm sure the band is great in person, and the CD cover images are really great, but the music didn't really trip my trigger. It's that Django/Hot Club period music, nothing too spectacular. I selected this particular CD of theirs because it had the least number of standards (such as "Nuages") and the least number of catchy cover songs (like movie themes). I thought it might be the one to help me determine how good the band's chops are. If you are planning on trying them out, go for one of their discs with the cover songs on it, so if you aren't impressed with the CD, at least you'll have a different version of a familiar song.
4324	Awesome concept, horrible quality.: I purchased these for 2 grown men at Christmas time. The kids were so excited to give them this awesome toy, but it was short lived. The second day one of the wings broke on one of the helicopters, and by the end of the following day, the other one wouldn't keep a charge or stop spinning in circles. I considered exchanging them, but I don't think I would have any different results, considering it was both of them that crashed and burned!
4325	juvenile, mean-spirited, and boring: This is really a horrible book. It is, apparently, the author'sintention to try and unearth real or imagined "scandals"and then to enjoy a good hearty laugh at his victim'sexpenses. Thus we learn that although Jane Appleton Piercelost her 13-year-son in a railroad accident that greatlydepressed her (seems reasonable enough), she was, according toFarquhar, a "real loony" because she was depressed.Similarly he jumps into homophobia by suggesting that JamesBuchanan was gay; and then winks and nods by telling us aboutthe long-time male companion he lived with and how sadhe was when he left.THIS is a scandal??As I breezed through more of the same kind of nonsense, Irealized that Mr. Farquhar's research is astoundingly limited,and in some cases, non-existent. His facts in many places areincorrect, and his desire to make fun of every public leaderwho may have had even the smallest human failing is ultimatelyjust tiring.Truly, one of the worst books I have ever read.
4326	NEW!: Once again, I was looking for hard cover editions, but the brand new editions are very disappointing. Linda
4327	Interesting book: Our family owns a Sears house that will be sold this year. My mother died last April at the age of 98 and had lived in the house since it was built by my father and grandfather in 1930. My parents were 3rd generation Americans and had one of the names listed on Page 116. They were not immigrants, as was assumed by their name. The house is in excellent condition, but family members all have homes in different cities and do not want the hassle of keeping it rented and seeing it destroyed byrenters.Sears homes are the very best quality not available in new homesnow. I have several books about them and wish I could find the75 page instruction book. I have the original blueprints.
4328	tiny package, HUGE fun: This book contains fluent, erudite words about shoes, but who cares? The point of the book is the luscious photography -- beautiful, enticing images of a large number of shoes.If you have friends who also love shoes, get a copy for each one and you can sit around for hours saying "omigosh, look at page 501!" and "wow, Carly Jane, page 347 is just what you need!" This is a whole lot more fun than it sounds, actually.And you can always place the book on your coffee table where it will (a) take up very little physical space and (b) end up enticing everyone who sits down in your living room into developing a shoe fetish.Seriously, this is a well-researched, beautifully photographed, elegantly written gem of a book. If you happen to like shoes, you really owe it to yourself to obtain a copy of it.
4329	Pacino gives a stunning performance with silver screen taste: The constant battle of good over evil continues in this thriller. Pacino all but steals the show. The special effects and gruesome creatures are catchy to the eye but Pacino's power and elegant evil steals what's left. His depiction of Satan or the Anti-Christ or "whatever" people like to call him( according to him) isn't short of extrodinary. He gives the old silver screen appeal. With his mesmerizing speeches he reaches out and says, "I don't need special effects, just put the camera in front of me and sit back and enjoy." A true masterpiece, right out of the Brando-book. "Ahh, vanity, my boy. It's my favorite sin."
4330	bright green laser: It has a very bright green light, which might be bigger than you expect when you are using it in classrooms. But perfect for using on bright screens. Easy to use.
4331	Disappointing!: My expectations for the new Thomas Anders album was high since the success of Modern Talking... I guess I was wrong! The songs on this album reminds me of his old style with some songs similar to MT style, except not as good. The only good songs I can really enjoy are "This Time" and "How Deep Is Your Love". The rest are pretty plain. Only buy this album if you have a chance to listen to it first.
4332	"Scientific" evidence: Overall I was disappointed with this book. I find some of the ideas interesting but I found mistakes concerning scienctific theories and major flaws in the research. For example when the author is discussing the birth of Christ he mentions that all the genetic information needed for the blood of the baby comes from the father. This is incorrect. These types of errors probably stem from the fact that many scientific articles listed in the bibliography are substancially out of date. I basically feel that most of the "scientific" evidence mentioned in this book is circumstancial and needs further investigation.
4333	Lucky Riding Horse: Bought for my grandson and he loves it. Easy to put together and seems very safe and durable.
4334	This Book will change your life!!: I have never read a book cover to cover until this one. As an avid athlete since the age of 7 I gained a huge appreciation thru this book of what it means to be alive. This book is about bike racing but it is about so much more. I have given this book to people as a gift and they have had the same response. Read this book, then go out and bike, run, hike, walk or whatever. This book will make you happy you are even here to do those things.
4335	Merely a synonym finder: The built-in thesaurus in my version of Microsoft Word was more comprehensive. Not recommended for professional use, maybe for pre-college students. It's at least a portable (if not terribly useful) little tome. You're better off upgrading to a real Roget's.
4336	There is a background sound TOO BAD: Do not buy this item. There is too high noise in the background. I do not recommend it to any one.
4337	Not worth finishing -- or even starting: This book was so "not me" that I quit reading after five pages. I couldn't figure out what was happening, who was who, or why I should care. And the language was so foul I couldn't stand it. Read at your own risk!
4338	Feeling and vigor: Forget fifty shades of gray! This is a true love story. A story with meaning and feeling. Gone with the wind will burrow deep in to your heart.
4339	Great for boating: I bought these for my dogs to wear when I am sunning myself in the middle of the lake so they don't get too tired. They work great and secure nicely. I ordered the XL and could have gotten by with the L I think but a little big is better than too small. (my dogs are 75 & 85 lbs)They also work well when we're boating so other boaters see them easily in the water and if they're swimming for an extended period of time so they don't tire out. The handle on the top makes it easy to help them on to the swim platform on the back of the boat too.
4340	Are you people serious? I think you need to see it again now that you're older: For some reason I do remember seeing this film as a kid, and I thought it was great. But now, seeing it again, I don't know, I think it's really kinda dumb. I can't remember what the appeal was back then. Maybe it was because I thought Carol Kane was hot. And Gene Wilder was still kinda popular at that time.Try watching this again, believe me, it's not so great. I should have rented this dumb thing first.
4341	Can't get there from here.: It's bad when it can't even find your own home. There are some nice features but they are overshadowed by it's inaccuracies in finding addresses.Can not be trusted.
4342	OM NOM NOM NOM!: These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you can't go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag I've come across. The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags.
4343	Wattie died...: To warn the fans of the 'real' Exploited, I must say this is now: this sounds NOTHING like "Punks Not Dead", "Troops of Tomorrow" early 80s English Oi! stuff. It is essentially a crusty-metal album, an attempt for 40-year Wattie to sound like a mix between "God Hates Us All"-style Slayer and Aus-Rotten. I say attempt because I find this to be inferior to early Exploited and any crust and metal bands there. It is music without a real direction, seemingly created to look "hardcore" for a dying band who has abandoned their punk roots altogether, for the most part.I hate to negatively review for what seems like such a stupid reason, but fans of early Exploited will understand how horrible this is when they hear it after listening to their "Punks Not Dead" LP again. I suggest not buying this unless you are a fan of modern metal, because it is not The Exploited most of us know and love.
4344	BEST MOVIE EVER: I think that The Grinch is the best movie ever created. I recommend it to everyone to watch. If you liked the original version of the grinch, then you'll LOVE the new one with Jim Carey. I have a countdown going on until i can go and get it on the 20th.
4345	Different every time: I was so excited to get this...then the excitement went away. The BMI normally reads the same, but the fat % changes every time I use it. Not just day to day, but if I try it 3 times in a row I will get 3 different readings. Not a satisfied customer!
4346	Only A Few Good Songs!!!: I purchased this on vinyl when it first came out and was disappointed to find that it only had a few good songs on it. I'm Not In Love is still among my favorite 10cc songs to this day and is about the only real highlight on this CD. Life Is A Ministroni is a dumb song and a waste of vital space on a relatively short CD. Don't waste your money on this one!!!
4347	Even the price does not worth it!: When I first check this item, I check other website and the people said this will work fine... but they were telling a big lie, because this item it's hard to play... even make all my system to work unproperly... I've updated the bios all day... change the USB configuration... switching all pci slot to work... and neither this port works as should be... please God Help me with this!!!I was copying some dvds of a trip that I take... and hillariously the program says it wil ltake about 6 hours to burning the movie, and that;s supposed to be USB 2.0 faster than anything about USB port... it will be taking 2 hour more to burning if i were using the USB 1.1. ports... I thinking about returning the item...
4348	The 2959 Plan is the best daily devotional: 2959 PlanI have been using this devotional since the early 1980s. I buy them from Park Avenue Bookstore for a reasonable price and they are three ring bound the same as I've been using since the 1980s. To sell one for over $200 is highway robbery since Peter Lord continues to reprint these for $18.00 plus shipping. Less if you buy the inserts and not the notebook. I read it daily and now he also gives you a cd explaining the background of this devotional. It is excellent.
4349	THANK GOD THIS WAS MAX'S LAST ALBUM.: WAY TO SLOW. MAX TOOK THEM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THEY SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE PURE THRASH. MAX IS AN AWESOME SONG WRITER, BUT HE CHANGED IT UP TO MUCH ON THIS ALBUM. BUY BENEATH THE REMAINS AND ARISE.
4350	Lots of old names and dates but nothing new: Interesting, well written, and a smooth read; however, much of the historical detail seems excessive and many readers will skim over what is written. If accurate it might be recommended to S&B bothers themselves, not to the general public. The title is a catchy promise - but I expected a lot more.
4351	Terrible phone: The remote unit is unreliable in the best of conditions and very often produces a horrible warbling noise that makes it useless. This is especialy true when located on a floor above the base unit. In just a few months the characters in the display on the base unit are illegible.
4352	useless: I am a huge fan of the original Swiffer. So, I was really excited to try this out. We have just one area rug. The rest of our place is all hardwood floors, so I figured this would be good for cleaning the rug.The Flik is basically a pretty orange plastic case on the outside and a tiny replaceable sticky pad on the inside. Angled bristles on the bottom are meant to 'flick' dirt up onto the sticky pad where it's supposed to stay. Sadly, it only picks up about half the dirt the first time over. On the next go it picks up some more and at the same time drops some of the stuff from the first round back on the floor. Yeah, it's only meant for 'in between' cleanings, but who is willing to pay money for a product that only picks up half the dirt? I ended up buying a big sticky roller. I have to use a ton of sheets of adhesive, but at least it works. Don't waste your money on the Flik!
4353	Successful x-mas present for a job hunter: I bought this book for a good friend of mine, a skilled creative writer, but with little experience in writing professional copy. Like most creative types, he was looking for a job to support his writing and other artistic habits. With the help of Kranz's book, he was able to land a well-paying job that makes use of his talents, suitably focused by the advice in Writing Copy for Dummies. If proof of the pudding is in the paycheck, I can vouch for the effectiveness of this author's approach and suggestions for aspiring professional writers.
4354	Author can't write!: I think there is some good info on swing dancing in this book... somewhere. Unfortunately, the writing and organization are so bad that I found the book worthless. Before I return the book and get my money back, I will write this review and maybe save some potential buyers.There are alot of positive reviews that don't mention the horrible writing -- they are probably friends of the author doing him a favor. The writing is so bad it is absurd (how did it get published?) You will reread a sentence 5 times and still have no idea what it means. Don't waste your money. If you do, save the reciept.
4355	Excellent Product: This product helped me keep using my ipod for another year after the battery died on it. It also allowed me to plug my ipod into a wall, charge it and the battery and keep it using it. The casing is a little tricky the first couple of times but isn't really a problem after that, and I kind of like the way it fits on the ipod, no danger of falling off of it. I would recommend this product to anyone with an ipod or mp3 player. The only drawback I would put on this product is that you have to take it out of it's case to connect it to a computer, but that's relatively minor.
4356	A Piece Of Junk: I'm ashamed to have chosen one star for this product. If I was able to click -0-, I would have. Don't waste your money on the Polaroid 320. Trying to get the pictures to download is a trauma in itself. It's a piece of junk.
4357	AM BAND SUCKS!!!!: Okay, I bought this for the news stations, and really, living in an earthquake prone area, to have in case of emergency. Out of the box, even with the the antenna fully extended, I can't get one single AM station to come in. I live in southern california, in a semi-metro area, so I don't understand why it doesn't come in! I can get fm reception...which if there really is a major emergency, I guess will suffice. Bottom line, I can't recommend it.
4358	Basic: I bought this product thinking it would bring my calculus to a higher level. It didn't. The product covers the most basic examples which you can follow in your text if you are taking a class which would be the main reason you buy this DVD. This product was not helpful in doing the higher number problems at the end of the chapters let alone the problems on tests which require insight and creativity. This is the most basic of explanations of Calculus which most people should be able to follow in each chapter of their text.
4359	meet the letters: My almost two year old will repeat the letters along with the DVD. She knows a few letters already just by sight.
4360	crappy, light duty radio const...fell apart out of the box in my hands: really poor packaging from the seller/shipper. Fell apart when I opened the box.supposed to be a nice radio from other reviews...but even with good packaging, I feel it is very light duty and would open up and break within a few months/weeks of use.too bad...I'd like a small but high quality SW radio rcvr...guess I'll hafta shell out some big bucks for a good one.
4361	Lottery Rose- Review: The conflict in the story was about a boy named Goergie getting abused by his mom and step dad. Goergie changed during the story because Goergie learns to be kind and gives love and he recieves love back. It makes him feel good inside. I would recommend this book to a freind because it's a good book and people would be interested in reading this book. The conflict is interesting, keep on reading.
4362	ulio: excelente, era el producto que se quería tal cual como lo indica el producto 100% recomendable muy bueno cumplen y a tiempo
4363	Rich History of Bulgaria Covered Brilliantly: It is not easy to write a concise history of a nation that is over 1300 years old but this account takes that time frame and boils it into an easy to follow account of the Bulgarians. One of the most important, yet unheralded, countries in Europe is dealt with in a manner that would make the Bulgarians proud of its history. Although embroiled in wars, external occupations and internal strife for much of its history; a rich and diverse cultural heritage has remained intact throughout Bulgaria. This history of Bulgaria should be read by any student of European history as it tends to unlock the rich vault of Eastern European history and its influence throughout the world.
4364	i knew id like this movie, i ordered it before id seen it.: id only seen the commersials for this movie, but even they looked fab.before id seen it i was either gonna cancel my order or just keep it as it it. i kept it.it reminds me of a kind of ''exorsist'' movie. but in a different kind of storey.two thumbs up. fabulous!
4365	Professional grade: This is not for the average comsumer. This product is designed for the professional web designer. Not for the end consumer as advertised. Many areas required knowledge of codes. I am going back to Frontpage 2003 til support stops. Expressions is much to difficult for my needs.
4366	Teriffic!: The second season was even better than the first. I've just fallen in love with the characters - both upstairs and downstairs. I hope Downton Abbey stays on the air for a long, long time.
4367	Snapped!: I enjoyed it for two weeks. I jumped every day and I was loving it. Then it snapped at the handle. So sad.
4368	Shame, Shame, Shame on you New Line...: I will not buy this until the extended version is released and i urge you to do the same.
4369	Board Games alternative to lead based Games Recall: 24 Game: Fractions/DecimalsBoard Games are best alternative for Gift Giving this holiday season of 2007.With the market scared of lead based games mattel recalls, is is confusing what else to put in ones gift list for this season.I find board games like 24 Game and the like are the best alternative to the current Mattel recall.
4370	A Slow Slide Downhill: Devoured the beginning, plodded through the middle, & skimmed the last twenty pages just to say I read the whole thing. A very disappointing, unbelievable ending. Read my favorite short scene while you're in the bookstore-- pages 111-114 (the classroom scene with Avery Knowland); if you still have to read it, check it out from the library.I'm going to try Mr. Carter's non-fiction book, "God's Name in Vain" since I enjoyed his "sideline soapbox passages" more than the dialogue and action. Seems he was trying to reach every possible market with this thriller--rich, poor, middle-class, African-American, white, gay, straight, intellectual, young, happily married, unhappily married, FBI agent, etc. etc. etc.My worst complaint: didn't like the use of the phrases "paler nation" and "darker nation." Are these the next NEW politically correct ways to describe one's skin color? This verbose "suspense thriller" lost its thrill a page at a time.
4371	The Big Red Machine: I have seen tons and tons of stuff on this game and I saw on one site that the look of Kane will be with and without his mask. Whatever they have one week before it is released on Raw and Smackdown will be updated into the game. It has more then 50 wrestlers and is getting more of them if wrestlers debut. Buy it it will be the best game for wrestling ever promised.
4372	Swiss Made!: An entirely Swiss made watch for less than $65 with free shipping and, at least when I bought it, a free football. This is my 23rd Invicta, but first aluminum case. Surprisingly light for a large watch. Neat strap too. It never ceases to amaze me how Invicta can come up with quality at this level for a price that is so low.
4373	Frustrating!: No instructions, buttons are in weird places... I had to research online to find the manual.I've already weighed two different amounts off by 6lbs.
4374	good book and shipment: This book is really good. The shipment wasn't as quick as the other books I ordered were, but it did arrive in a decent amount of time.
4375	Handy Gadget for the iPod Classic: This is a good idea (especially when one refuses to pay a cable company over $90.00/month for Network TV) and despite the poor remote performance, I love having the things. Yes - I have two.I'm not a techie, so I was pleased to discover the station easy to install and the interface between TV and iPod pretty slick. The remotes are a pain - particularly at any great distance - they just aren't very responsive.I like being able to shuffle through pictures and display them on the big screen, and even with my lack of technical finesse I found it simple to use and enjoy. I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't get frustrated with the occasional lack of remote control.
4376	Works great for the price: Not too "tack-y"; breathable; good grip..... Great glove Great glove Great glove Great glove Great glove Great glove Great glove
4377	wonderful words of wisdom, a must read for all: Talks with Trees was recommended to me by a friend and I am so grateful she told me about it. I found it to be an amazing little book. Talks with Trees is funny, sweet and extremely enjoyable. I will read this book many times and recommend it to all. It is filled with wonderful messages and wisdom that will inspire you and enhance your daily life. Keep an open mind and an open heart and enjoy. Read Talks with Trees to enrich your life and the life that surrounds us each day. Thank you Leslie Cabarga for this truly incredible book! I hope there is another to follow.
4378	Good fun for the kids: We have a 6 girl and a 4 yr old boy who rarely play video games. This game seems just right for them. In fact, they are still both afraid to try the "tractor tipping" portion of the game becaue it's 'too scary.' They do, however, love how it closely resembles the movie.
4379	Very ordinary game for toddlers!: I have heard a lot about Call of duty games, and I really wanted to have one for a long time. So, to start with, I bought this product (Call of Duty 2) hoping that I was buying a wonderful product. However, to my surprise, the graphics of this game is horrible, just like watching a cartoon of early 80s! I am very disappointed.... may be I should try Call of Duty 4! I do not know whether I will buy the 4 or not... :(Please do not buy this product if you love good graphics!
4380	A thrill-ride of emotions: This is a spectacular drama, filled with surprising bits of humor. These characters have a wide range of personalities, and they all mesh together, creating a vivid sense of realism.If you read only one book the rest of your life, then make it one you'll never forget! Alliance & Defiance.
4381	A heartbreakingly beautiful CD: For those who will allow themselves to be vulnerable, this is an incredibly heartfelt recording. Richard Thompson's "Farewell, Farewell" alone is worth three times the price. Mary makes you feel every meaning. Declan Sinnott's guitar playing is an absolute joy, and the guitar sounds are delicious. This is one of those CDs that you want to listen to alone.
4382	Boring: All I can say about this movie is that it was BORING...and a little weird. I never read the book so I don't know how close to that it came. But if the book was that boring I don't know how it ever got made into a movie.And if I had little kids I would definitely NOT let them watch this. With hideous creatures, the kid getting swallowed by one, violence like birds getting knocked out of the air with stones and a creature's arm getting pulled off, I would say this would cause a young child to have many nightmares. Do not let young children watch this.Boring and disturbing at the same time. I am not usually harsh in my reviews but there's absolutely nothing positive I can say about this movie.
4383	Adopt a Mom: I felt the book was a great set up to screw up your adopted child. I also felt that the author has deeply embedded issues that she needs to deal with. I do agree that their is a grieving process though. I also agree that infants do sense more then we give them credit for. I felt the book was very defeating for adoptive parents. I want what is best for my child and I felt that this book would not be for us or for my child. I am sorry her parents are dead. They did the best that they could in raising the author. No upbringing is ideal but it may be better then being brought up in an abusive home (like I was). Maybe she should thank the people who do adopt because their is alot of "anti-adoptism" out there. My child would have been in an emotionally neglectful household and be brushed aside had she stayed with the birth mom. Adoption is a special event and not an event that is suppose to scar someone for life.
4384	Nothing new here: The information contained in this book could have been condensed down to 5 - 10 pages. This is old information that has been repackaged to sell books. If someone is interested in reading this book I would recomend obtaining it through an inter-library loan as I do not think it is worth the cost nor is the information unique enough to have in a personal library.
4385	Cool guide: Great book, very illustrative. Worth having it in your pack or jeep whenever going on a wild trip. Very useful and easy-to-do sugestions, practically covering all important topics.
4386	Bad writing will kill a story: This book was a ok until the end. Everything after the wedding (the last 70 pages or so) felt like a quick add-on to the rest of the story, complete with bad writing and everything. If that last part hadn't been there and the story stopped at the wedding, I might have given this book 3 stars.
4387	Did I really need it?: Nope, didn't really need it but it looked cool. Ran well for about 6 months but now one of the fans is sticking and is making a humming noise
4388	stupid beyond words: *1/2Three gorgeous women - a Japanese princess, a professional wrestler and an assassin/thief - travel to an island to compete in the world's greatest martial arts tournament in "DOA," a dumb-dumb karate-chopping extravaganza (derived from the video game "Dead or Alive") that has all the wit, credibility and intellectual heft of a lesser episode of "Charlie's Angels" (or the equally lame movies derived there from).The women are portrayed by Jaime Pressly, Devon Aoki and Holly Valance, three no-talent actresses who do at least manage to kick up a storm in the movie's nonstop fight scenes - though, of course, in the post-"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" style of the day, all the martial arts moves pay little or no heed to even the most rudimentary laws of gravity and physics. It's all very stylized, self-knowing and tongue-in-cheek in style and tone, but none of it is in any way humorous or exciting.[...]
4389	Loads of fun!: Bought this to play with my 7 yr old nephew when he came to visit for a few days. We went to the park and had a great time figuring out different ways to launch the missiles and catch them. I bought both the lightweight and plastic missile the lighter ones seemed to go farther but damaged more easily. Make sure you have extra refills. A game that all ages can play together and have fun.
4390	Disappointed Buyer: I bought this book for my daughter's fourth grade class and was disappointed to see nudity on almost every page. I've purchased paper paper doll books from other eras and had no problem, but this one was completely unusable. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased it.
4391	Nose hole is wierd!: not a bad product but the nose hole doesnt fit right , i had to cut it a bit with a scissors.
4392	Biohazard: Ken Alibeck's book is excellent. It illustrates all the evils of the former Soviet Union's bioweapons program in very good detail.I recommend this book for anyone interested in understanding what totalitarian communist regimes spend their efforts on.
4393	Rabbit is Great!: Let's get the negative out of the way first. The battery cover is very loose and I expect it to fall off at any time. Also, turning on the pearls really cuts back on the vibrating rabbit, which pretty much leaves you a choice of using one or the other. The pearls are also pretty loud.Now, for the positive. The rabbit is awesome! The ears are perfectly positioned and are firm enough to provide just the right amount of friction. The control for the rabbit provides a good range of vibration, which is easily adjustable.The insertable portion is smoother and firmer than toys I've had previously, which is a definate plus. I am well pleased with the product overall.
4394	Christianity the Way it was Intended from the Beginning: Years ago I had a copy of a book that documented the move of the Holy Spirit since the first century to the present. It was loaned out and never returned and because it was privately published I could never find another. For years I have prayed for someone to write the truth how the gifts of the Spirit never really stopped down through the centuries. This is the book that I prayed to be written. Eddie L. Hyatt researched and documented how the gifts of the Spirit continued for the past two millenium and the revivals that broke out in spite of the persecutions the Spirit filled Christians endured. Every Christian needs to read this book to understand that the dry stale so called Christian church of the modern and postmodern era is not the real church that Jesus died for. The miracle working power of the Holy Spirit is still touching the Church. I am buying another so I can have a loaner.
4395	GREAT: Another great book. I would recommend this. One of those books that is hard to put down and you want to keep reading even though you have to get up and go to work the next day....loved it
4396	Happy customer!: The Omron HEM-650 is all I expected, a very good purchase. The item came in Excelent condition and as promised, delievered on time.Good Job, thank you.
4397	Ab Ab Laut Chalen is...Nice!: I saw a song from the movie Ab Ab Laut Chalen and it made me want to see the whole movie. So i looked into it and found it and was happy with the movie! It was a delight to see and i enjoyed it! :)
4398	An exercise in monotony: I'm a Harry Turtledove fan, and a fan of much alternate history fiction, but this book was excruciatingly boring. I am not kidding when I say that on could easlily skip 150 pages and not have missed any action or character development. I loved the series up to this point and was excited when I saw the book came out, but my disappointment after reading this awful thing cannnot be exaggerated. Warning, spoilers: For any of you fans of the series, be content in the knowledge foreshadowed in the last book that the U.S. send a ship to Home. The action while there is as barren the Turtledove's description of Home's environment. For a more interesting read, pick up a copy of Home and Gardening or 17.
4399	Finally, the Novelization: At long last! Somone novelized Lowell Cunningham's Men In Black comic that was published through Aircel Comics back in 1990. I was really thrilled to see this. I wait with baited breath for my copy to arrive.
4400	leaves you like your done kissing a horses ass: blehhhh, horrible beginning to a horrible series. this is either scary nor funny, though its fun in some parts if I may correct myself. but no logic and a stupid premise involving shillings(what arent shillings like a penny a piece, so if the leprechaun has 100 shillings, then he has a dollar, cool plot to kill off people, he must of been in poverty at the time). and Jennifer Aniston is wasted too. ugghhhh
4401	A Hit in Brazil!: In Brazil, books are so expensive you'd think there was a ban on them, and few modern, non-Brazi authors get translated and brought over. So, when I saw the Portuguese version of Five Men Who Broke My Heart in a tropical small town nook, I had to grab it and run for my life from the Brasileiras circling around the last few candy-red jackets.Sue's story is universal. It serves to empower those of us who need righting through example; and sends us on a trip in a relationship-Delorian to the core of what went wrong, and what could've been avoided. Sue does her teaching through a hands-on vivisection of her most bumpy landings on love's concourse, and in the process, she opens not only her own black box but ours as well. That's because as soon as you delve into this book, you'll realize, "Hey, that's ME in the Wonder Bra!" You'll see your mistakes and the snaking paths you could've straightened, or at least know how they went into making who you are now.
4402	Entertaining: First off I have to say that this book is nothing short of entertaining from the beginning to the very end. If one was to simply put aside an over anlaytical mind and simply embrace the fact that the word FICTION means using your imagination and letting the unexplained go, you are guaranteed to enjoy this book.The best way to simply describe this book is James Bond with more muscles!There's action, there's politics, there are guns, there are agents. It is a book that leaves you with curiousity. You are left with the desire to actually look up Einstein and Physcics to learn more about what exactly "the theory of relativity" is.Obviously if you were a physicist, mathematician or scientist, you would be able to poke so many holes in the book but even you have to admit, you wish you were JOHN TAFT!Overall I would say, if you are looking to enjoy a good read and get lost in the world of spies AND scientists without a lotta mumbo jumbo to confuse you, go pick this book UP!
4403	¡Absolutamente Maravilloso!: This CD has some of Enrique's best songs on it. My personal favorite is "Be With You," all of the songs are great though! This Cd is good when you just want to kick back and listen to some music or anything else. I listen to it when i'm cleaning my room or when i'm on my computer chatting with my friends. I even searched at GOOGLE for the lyrics to some of them. Overall its a realy good CD and i suggest buy it!
4404	GREAT PHOTOS BUT FLUFFY TEXT!: This "official" book has great color photos and reproductions of the original film posters, but the text is aimed at kids. The film reviews are glossy puff-pieces, and the film history is breezy & uncomplicated. Steve Ryfle "Japan's Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of 'The Big G'" is more complete, but wasn't approved by Toho or TriStar, so it's photo selection is terribly inadequate. Get both of these books, and you'll have it ALL on Godzilla.
4405	Cheap and Works: Nothing special here. Purchased for outside use at a pool, so am expecting about a year's worth before it dies or the clear plastic front yellows due to exposure to the sun. Would have given five stars but for the fact that it is packaged in tightly fitted plastic over the face and very difficult to remove, risking damaging the unit.
4406	Fit issues make this cable useless: Unless I got a defective unit, I found this cable to have the same problem as the other one-star reviews have cited. The product just doesn't fit snugly enough to work. When I hold the cables in, they work just fine. However, I cannot even set my equipment back in their shelves without the cables popping out.I've been trying to connect these cables to my Yamaha receiver, Sony Blue-Ray player and Samsung TV. It just doesn't have a snug fit on any of the products. Disappointing after seeing overwhelming positive reviews. I'm returning it.
4407	Fantastic.: For my birthday, my mom gave me this shirt to wear during the Annual Chili Cook-off in downtown. Usually I wear something sweetness like my Mongoose GT t-shirt, but my mom wanted me to dress up for the occasion. Let me tell you, while wearing this shirt we won 4th place in the Chili cook-off and my friend's aunt was all over me. I cant explain it. I told my guild about it and now we are all going to rock it during the next raid, like a boss.
4408	software has a trojan in it, and not fuctional: after installing it I had to right click the programs properties and set it up for windows 95 compatibility settings because it wouldn't respond in windows xp then it worked however everytime I looked up any article or word with the encyclopedia it would produce no results.. (font wasn't showing up) no information on the subject so tell me.. what good is the encyclopedia if all it shows are pictures.. I might add some topics do have information and tells u about it like "canals" for instance but in the dictionary it produces nothing so far. some only show pictures but no info.. I am still playing around with it but so far not impressed at all.-------just now discovered the software had a TROJAN embedded in it!!!! very upset about this! And worst of all there is no way to uninstall the program. do NOT I repeat do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! product cost me very little so rather than hassling with a return I have to take a loss on it!
4409	Not Fowler's best: Although this book had its moments, overall it was rather flat. Most of the characters were strangely listless, as if half-drugged. I would have preferred to read the story from the perspective of either Nell or Ti Wong rather than Lizzie; I suspect they would have put a little more sparkle into the story. I agree with the reviewer who found the staccato writing style odd and the plot under-developed. Your time would be better spent on "The Sweetheart Season" or "The Jane Austen Book Club."
4410	Great Product: We really loved this product for our son and plan on purchasing it for a baby shower. I would recommend purchasing the toddler size as we had done for longer use. My sister bought the smaller size as she was not aware of two sizes and her son outgrew it within 7 months.
4411	Yummy!: I had to make cornbread for my son's cubscouts banquet and we are now gluten free. I am not fond of cornbread usually but my son LOVES it. I found this gf cornbread mix and made it as cornbread muffins. Oh my goodness....they were BIG and fluffy and SO very good! I loved them. I never love cornbread, never. This is a first AND they are gluten free! I will be buying this mix again. It is better than non-gf cornbread if you ask me. My son LOVED it and my daughter liked it and she usually hates cornbread. I don't have to try to make my own recipe or find one to make, this is a keeper. I will buy it again. It's the best right out of the oven, but even as left overs it was good with some butter on it. YUMMY!
4412	Excellent Book, very well done: This book is written not just for a gay audience, as you might initially suspect. It offers touching stories that women, who happen to be lesbian, face in raising their families. The photos are beautiful and capture the emotion and love that these special families feel for one another. Well done.
4413	Embelishment not very attractive: I liked the idea of the corduroy jacket, but the trim on the placket was strange. There were some nice beads in the red and earthtone families, but then there were really big "crystal" beads in the wrong color families for the jacket. Things like pink and lavender. Really strange. I decided to return it.
4414	off the chain!!!!: This album is off the hook. I've been bumpin it in my car since i got it. It sounds tight if you got subs but it's also good just to listen to in your headphones because Obie is very insightful on this album. This album is the best of the summer thus far.TOP 5:All Of My Life feat. Nate DoggObie StoryEverywhere I Go feat. 50 CentThere They Go feat. Em, Herk, and Trick TrickMama
4415	How To Write a Book: In The Creed Room, Dan Spiro deftly drives us through his philosophy and politics by creating characters we genuinely care about. It is a book about the mind that engages the heart.Without sentimentality, Spiro makes us care about the sometimes-misguided journey of his sometimes-antagonistic protagonist. We meet people who interest us, thrust into a situation of conflict and intrigue, and we listen to the ideas of individuals placed in the same room in order to hammer out a philosophical creed for living through a range of disparate convictions. We hardly realize we're getting a lesson in the various tenets of a range of philosophies ourselves. We have met a little universe of people and we can't wait to find out what happens to them next.What a deft lesson this book is - a lesson in writing, in holding reader interest, and in proselytizing ever so gently, without preaching or propagadizing.
4416	Doesn't do a thing.: My cat has been under stress & urinating outside the box. The vet ruled out any sort of bladder or kidney problems, so I thought I'd try this. I have two of the diffusers plugged in & am also using the spray. It has had absolutely no effect after almost a month. What a waste of money.
4417	Having used dandruff shampoos in the past, I ...: Having used dandruff shampoos in the past, I was very pleased and surprised that Neutrogena T-Gel was fragrance-free. The ones I've used before were very medicinal smelling! It took a bit to get it lathered up, but once it was, it was very rich and soapy. I had only a few flakes here and there but after two uses they were gone. I also used this product on my four-year-old who has a very flaky and dry scalp. Although it hasn't cleared up my problem yet, it's definitely improving and I feel that it will continue to do so. I really liked this shampoo. It's different from the traditional dandruff shampoos in as much that it acts like a regular shampoo but happens to clear dandruff!
4418	Easy to use BUT quits too soon!: Do your homework before you spend $$$ on this camera. It is easy to use, and takes great pictures while it works. Average life span for this camera is less than 2 years. The longest anyone has had one in good use is 2 1/2 years. Way to much to spend for a "disposable" camera, that can't be fixed by the manufacturer.
4419	this cd is the cheesiest...almost as lame as the movie.: the cd is sentimental and cheesy...I still can't believe the scene in the movie where everyone left their character and decided to sing along to that bogus Aimee Mann song....if you are really into neutral chick rock, this album may suit you, but if you have any taste at all...you'll scrap it.
4420	Smart and well put together study guide...: The Microsoft Visual Basic 5 Exam Cram was a great book for the money. I would highly recommend this book as a quality study guide for Exam #70-165. The book was concise, easy to read and the test questions were of the caliber that will be seen on the certification exam. There were a few mistakes in wording and some of the end of chapter test questions were wrong or conflicted with the chapter material (i.e. Questions #2 and #3, Chapter 9 and Questions #11 and #45 on the Sample Test).
4421	Passion of the Jew: I felt really ripped off when I found that it was just a regular episode, not a "special" like I thought it was. I already have this episode (it's part of the eighth season) and I also have the two "bonus episodes" as well... It'll make a good gift for someone I suppose.Don't get me wrong, it's as funny as you'd expect, brilliant even, but if you are already a collector of South Park box sets, beware - you don't need to add this to your collection!
4422	Worth the money!: The repetition provided in the CD, pace and style of teaching is truly helpful for a beginner who's learning the language for the very first time. Unlike some other programs which teaches at a very fast pace, making one feels lost and confused, this one allows you time to memorize and digest what you've learn. Overall, I am truly impressed and will recommend it to everyone!
4423	GREAT BOOK!!!!!: I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I LOVE READING BOOKS ABOUT NITA AND KIT. I ALSO LIKED THE VIVIDNESS THAT MRS. (MS.?) DUANE USED WHEN WRITING ABOUT THE SPELLS. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTO FICTION,ESPICALLYBOOKS ABOUT ALIENS,WIZARDS,OR WITCHES.ALSO, THE CARACTERS WERE GREAT.I LOVE THE WAY SHE DESCRIBES NITA,KIT,DAIRIANE, AND THEIR PARENTS.THEY COULD ALMOST BE REAL!!!! I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE.
4424	do i need buy a cd to put music on my call phone: i got a motprola q do you need buy a motorola mobile phone for the motorola q olny put music you have on your pc to put them on your cell phone please let me no buy give me a e-mail at crownemergency34@att.net think you if you can help me out
4425	poor quality: i bought this trusting the many good reviews but got disappointed, it is of pretty poor quality and its not confortable at all, do not buy this trust me!!!
4426	Hated this racist and stupid film rendition: I hated this film. Racially, flawed, ignorant..and terrible story. Great acting, all around..but I hate the story....to much hatred in the film for me. Too much sufffering, all around.
4427	not that great: i'm not sure to whom this record was targeted at...but it sure as hell wasn't the sabbath fan. biohazard? ugly kid joe? most of this album is sadly lacking any intensity that the real black sabbath had...wake me when it's over.
4428	Very Disappointing Read: I am glad that I borrowed this book from the library instead of buying it. I was very anxious to read this book, but very disappointed in it. The characters were flat, and the plot seemed totally contrived.I had a very complicated pregnancy and doubt that the doctors would have let Lexi carry the baby to term. More than likely, she would have had a C-section before the due date. If that had happened in the book, then everything would have been ok, and Nicholas Sparks would have written a much more realistic book.Do not waste your time or money on this book.
4429	Concerned Parent: Book should be entitled "Dare to Hit Your Child with Whatever is Handy". Dobsen extolls virtues of his wife snapping their not yet two-year-old with a switch across the shins, can you imagine? He also attests that he received great benefit, as a child, by being spontaneously walloped by his mom's girdle, complete with buckles and straps.The fact is, that spontaneous anger from a parent can be beneficial to a child, in seeing that his actions may set off undesired reactions. Yet, spontaneous violence sends an absolutely wrong message of physical superiority making "right" in a confrontational situation.My children turned out quite well, I think with equal parts luck, love, and parental boundries. I didn't get anything from this book (I read it years ago) that I utilized in child-rearing, except a dedication to never hit my children.
4430	Bad iron: This iron has all the features you would need, but burns clothes. If you want to use the steam setting it burns the cloth to the iron then gets it on other things you are ironing. I have cleaned it, used lower settings, nothing helps. Would not recommend to anyone. Have ruined too many clothing articles.
4431	I LOVE THIS MOVIE: I saw Watcher in the Woods when I was little. Now at 23 I saw it again last night. It is so scary, I wanted to sleep on the floor in my parents room. It is nothing like a Disney movie I have nave no clue why it is rated G or PG. I would never let any small kids see this movie. If you are older and want to see a really scary movie go out and get this one.
4432	Time waster: This movie is so stupid, I threw it away since it would cost more than it is worth to return.
4433	AMAZING Film & Kickin Soundtrack!: This is a GREAT buy for any Skier, Snowboarder or Slider of any kind!As Warren says,"It doesn't matter what your choice of snowriding equipment is, so forget the centruy's old term Skier and the decades old term Snowboarders, and just call us all SnowriderS!"Staggering beauty is abundant in this film and a couple scenes that are difficult to believe people would actually attempt and successfully pull off! Get Ready for some Great Action, and a darn good, rockin soundtrack to add to the mix! ...THANKS WARREN!!!My Video Tape of this wore out so I sure was glad to see it here on DVD!-Jimmer Mackinnon aka, DJ Jimmer(I'm one of the "Stars" of this film in the "Breakneck Hill" segment, at about the films mid-point)See Warren Miller on www. Face Book and myself on [...]
4434	Good, but moves kind of fast: I am new to yoga. I've been taking a class locally at a wellness center and bought this dvd so I could also do yoga at home when desired. This dvd is a great representation of yoga for beginners through much more advanced. However, the instructor seems to move from one move to the next quite quickly. I like holding a pose a little longer to fully get the feel for it. I would still purchase it if I had it to do over again.
4435	Cleans up Halo 2's mistakes: I loved Halo 2's co-op features,but I thought that the missions were terrible!The missions where you were elites were just agony!But Halo 3 is such a large step up in TONS of way,such as,the co-op maps are a lot more fun,complex,and just plain better than Halo 2,the missions are so much better I can't name all of the improvements,but I will anyway.My favorite thing about co-op missions is to ride in a vehicle,my brother drives,while I operate the turret and wipe out all enemies in our path.I beat the game on all levels of difficulty and still haven't gotten tired of the game,I play it every time I go down to my neighbors house(which is quite often)and we enjoy every minute of it,whether it be shotguns,energy swords,or rocket launcher(all of which are my favorites)it's always a blast.Halo 3 is my favorite Xbox 360 game and I can't wait till Halo Wars comes out(I love RPG's)(role playing games).
4436	Plundering Music: John Tesh has good taste, but as they say, "jack of all trades, master of none." A good buy for varied musical tastes, but I think it would be more rewarding trying to collect the really good CDs of all genres explored. For example, Sacred Spirits is a good one if you like "Valley of Dreams." Now if I could just find a good celtic CD so I don't have to resort to John Tesh.
4437	Not so impressed: This was not my favorite or most useful book for when I set out to homestead. Although it has a lot of good information in it, it is too dense and hard to read through, and too hard to find info immediately as I need it. I read it occasionally, but found the Storey books much more useful for practical, look-it-up-now information.
4438	Not enough Kim D: I bought this dvd towatch Kim Dawson, myfavorite B-movie Queen, and she had only one scene. I'vealways thought she has the talent and the looks (that all natural smoking hot body) to make it big time but never got her break.
4439	One of these "cures" came from a guy's dream. Seriously!: When our 12-year old son was diagnosed with Lymphoblastic Lymphoma in 2006, my wife wanted me to read about one of the recommended "treatments" in this book. Her family had told everyone they know about this particular treatment. I was shocked to learn that the guy who formulated the treatment was not a doctor or an educated scientist, but had "received" his formula in a dream. I kid you not! As we are Jehovah's Witnesses, I asked a respected JW elder his opinion. He replied, "So, the demons know what works. Big deal!" Absolutely true story!
4440	Surprisingly pleased: I started reading this out of sheer curiousity, but I ended up enjoying it more than I thought. I was amazed at how much I learned by the time I was done with the book. Tons of pages are turned over and many passages are marked. This is something which I will refer to frequently.
4441	Does not tolerate Cold: I bought this for a temperate area of Florida. It arrived OK, and seemed to do well until winter rolled around. We had a 34* night and it died immediately. So beware of planting this in any area where temperature go to 34*.
4442	Was there any doubt this was a good purchase.: Amazing price, amazing movies. There is nothing else I can really say about it. This was the best christmas present I received for this price.
4443	A MUST BUY!!: THIS YOUNG MAN HAS THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL. THE ALBUM IS UNBELIEVEABLE AND PEOPLE OF ALL AGES SHOULD BUY IT, NO MATTER WHAT GENRE OF MUSIC YOU LISTEN TO. I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR MORE FROM THIS YOUNG TALENT
4444	creamy on skin: I think this is a good product but not the best. I am still looking for that one. I did like the way it went on my skin around the eye.
4445	Not an ideal reference.: I picked up this book from my college's library when I was researching how to clothe some nude figures I had drawn from life. But I was rather disappointed. The folds and wrinkles shown in this book are wildly exaggerated and often wrong. I also had a hard time feeling any 'weight' to the folds. Some of the concepts written about are good advice, but those are so skewed in the drawings that if anyone tried to actually follow them I'm fairly certain their art professors would laugh and promptly down grade the work. In all honesty I have no idea why my school even has this book. Every student I showed it to immediately recognized it's faults. You're better off googling pics of real people (or better yet- getting a live model), then trying to use this book.
4446	get what you pay for: whould have been nice if it didn't fall apart the 2nd time i flicked it, product came a little late yet well packeged. was very delacate near the open side and fill sidequick note: why would it sell for 17 dollars?
4447	Waste of Money: This book attempts to give an overview of Building Switched Networks. It might succeed in doing just that if it were not so poorly written. Sentence structure seem to be lost on this author and his editors. If only I could get back the time I've wasted muddling though this book, I'd be a very happy person.As to the technical competency of the book, the author is definitely buzzword 2.6 compliant. However, the meat just isn't there to back up the statements. Perhaps I've missed it. Perhaps the meat is cleverly disguised in the poor grammar and writing style.
4448	Disappointing: This book was pretty disappointing overall. There have been much better KISS bios out there like "KISS & SELL". This is poorly written, poorly produced, and very negative. The author makes a lot of statements but doesn't back up many of them with facts.His second book, "Black Diamond II" is much better as it concentrates on KISS collectibles.
4449	Starter book: A book for someone who is wanting to begin exploring theatrical costume design or production.
4450	Wonderful Film! But DVD presentation upsetting...: I love this film, and the english dub is actually quite good. If you have not seen the film, watch it! BUT.. I believe Fox has misjudged its audience and created a DVD that I find lacking. Sure, its animated and made for children but I'm in my mid 20's and do not have any children and could not wait to get this DVD. I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that there was no original Japanese language track on this DVD.I know this sounds like previous reviews but I was so disappointed about the missing Japanese track that I had to add my voice here.
4451	Reliability Less Than Acceptable: The setup was easy enough, but the reliability of the wireless signal to my laptops was not acceptable. Speed drops dramatically for unknown reason and I had to reboot the router at least once a week because speed was so slow. After turning off and back on, speed was back to normal.
4452	The Bank: Very good movie! The principle characters were very believable and made for some thoughtful conjecture as to the reality of how banks do business.
4453	Mauled again - killing bears to enrich himself: Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that man is not a advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself.
4454	None: Hidden Legacy started out filled with an interesting plot, however it fell flat and quickly became boring and elementary. Fortunately this was a freebie or I would be kicking myself for wasting time and money on this sophomoric piece. A true disappointment. Can I get a refund on my time?
4455	Useful and Balanced: Despite all the clammer, I found this book to be surprisingly balanced, and if, like me, you dont know too much about the conflict, its really a useful guide. Very much recommended.
4456	This product does not meets a good time, in my vw beatle only work two months: This product does not meets a good time, in my vw beatle only work two months then stopped doing so therefore do not recommend it.
4457	Good but hard to keep in "zero": I purchased this scale 4 weeks ago, the setup was easy, the posibility to detach the front part is great because you can put the panel in front of your eyes, so there is no need to look down, I atteched it to the wall at eye-level. The main problem is that every time that you need to weigth, you have to nivelate it, in other words, you have to put pressure in the scale for a couple if seconds, then stop and wait for the scale to calibrate an put it self in zero, then you can stand on it. Also, the feature to give you the body fat level is kind of difficult to access. I paid less than 20 for it, so, no regrets !!!
4458	REMIXED - DON'T BUY IT: Nightmare for fans of the original LP. As has been stated in other reviews, about four or five songs have subtle but extremely disappointing re-mixes. Many of the little things that I had come to know by heart are suddenly gone and replaced.SACRILEGE! Why do record companies desecrate legendary pieces of work? For shame!By the way - I rate the original "Who Are You" very highly! It's in my top 20 of all-time favorite rock albums.
4459	childhood memories: this encyclopedia was literally my favorite book growing up, i've probably read all the animal descriptions at least a few times. great illustrations, great general information. perfect for children's reports. was also very useful for drawing and painting inspirations
4460	Horrifically overrated!: While I typically do not make it a habit of reviewing albums I do not like, I make an exception for this particular album because it is maintaining a four star rating, which it in no way deserves.This is the worst album "Pink Floyd" ever made, and compared to the thoroughly mediocre 'Momentary Lapse of Reason' and the 'UmmaGumma' studio/noise tracks, that's actually saying more than you might think. Only Floyd fans who own every other album PF ever made, as well as the first two Waters solo albums plus all the Syd Barrett solo stuff should even think about buying this waste of polycarbonate.
4461	Almost a home run: This thing is great, runs long on a single 9 volt, or use the little power cord wherever you take it, USB powers the base station. Picture is definatly worth the price. I would only recomend one thing, get a rechargeable 9 volt battery (or more) because even though you can do alot with this thing, you cannot recharge it. so before you go bonkers buying a few batteries, break out the cash and get some rechargeables, because the kit does NOT contain one, nor the means to recharge one. other than that, Logitech hit this one out of the park, but it swayed just a bit out side of the right field line.
4462	When slavery and domestic violence was okay: Stories about how women are stupid and only of value if young and pretty. Also tells us that if you want a wife, just take the woman of your choice and imprison her because eventually she will fall madly in love with you. PS domestic violence is okay!
4463	One of the best: Picked this up by chance on holiday in Greece. Historical fictional setting but "modern" psychology (particularly male/female relationships) and totally believable characters. Funny and moving at the same time. If you like Diane Norman, you'll love this.
4464	Poorly written: I am using this book in a CCNA semester 1 class. Although it is by Cisco and therefore contains the information they want you to know, it is poorly written. It is as if the original text were 3 times as long, and to shorten it, they had to take out every third sentence, because it does not flow, and concepts are often only half-explained. I am *often* reading it and think "What????" (And I'm fairly certain it's not just me - I have a B.S. and M.S in Computer Science and plenty of real-world computer experience). All in all, I have to say that this is not a high-quality book.Although it's not a substitute for the CCNA material, I really like the book called "Interconnections" by Radia Perlman.
4465	Rome The Complete First Two Seasons: Rome The Complete First Two Seasons is an excellent collectible. I almost like all the HBO series as they deliver a strong message. However Rome in particular is more appealing because of the context. I understand some of the contents in the series are not historically correct but they add to the dramatic flavor. The cast and crew is just scintillating. I would strongly recommend for all adults who have an interest in history to try to get this as part of their collection.
4466	Have a bucket when you watch this movie: confused by the title? when you watch this movie, you won't be. Godzilla ISN'T Godzilla. IT'S A FREAKIN' MUTANT RADIOACTIVE IGUANA, THE CHARACTERS ARE AS DUMB AS ROCKS, AND THE WHOLE STORY IS POINTLESS!!!!!!!!!!! want good advice? GET SOMETHING ELSE WITH YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4467	Total money makeover: This is a great way to start a new life to financial peace. I a excited to get started. It all makes sense.
4468	So Simple: 'Straw Men' is a disappointingly simple book. Mr. Smith guides the reader along a predictable and sometimes aggravatingly obvious path throughout the story. The clues in this mystery novel leave nothing for the reader to deduce on their own.There is no reason you'll need your brain for this read. Everything will be throughly explained to you and that is what is so sad about it. You are treated like a obtuse three year-old.If don't think it's suspicious when a beat cop has a $50k Mercedes SUV as a second vehicle, this book might be a good challenge for you. Otherwise stick to James Patterson or James Lee Burke.I give this book two stars for the sole fact that it takes place in Pittsburgh.
4469	Best Show Ever: Sanctuary is a wonderful realistic fantasy with likable characters, engaging episode-to-episode (as well as season-arching) plots, superb writing and gifting acting. Definitely for the Sci-Fi fan, as well as anyone interested in genuinely good story telling of very human characters and character interaction.5/5.
4470	Motorola T305 Bluetooth Hands-Free Speaker: Works great!Battery life if very good also. I use in my work truck mostly and the people I talk to can hear me fine. This is a dump truck in summer and a snow plow in winter. It is a loud truck even with the windows up. They can hear the truck but they can hear and understand me fine. In car it is even better a nowhere near as loud inside(as the truck)seems to work better than my moto t700 headset. It is about the size of a genie garage door opener. If anything changes I will update but so far great.
4471	I drew the short straw on this bottle: The size is great and the color is very rich. The top is very durable, but the initial trial of the bottle was interesting. You actually have to bite the rubber end to get the tip to open and allow you to suck water up the straw (takes some practice and oral talent). I teach high school and I wanted to use crushed ice in with the water to use at work. The straws are about an inch short of reaching the bottom of the bottle. When I add ice, the straw typically gets dislodged from the cover multiple times and I can't get a drink without taking the cover off and fishing the straw, which has now sunk to the bottom of the bottle. If I could melt the straw to the top, I would... I'd shop for something else next time.
4472	Truly Magical: The beauty that is The illusionist plays on a beckoning plot that is filled with mystic, intrigue and undying love. The culmination of the story is the most elegant of reality called 'ordinariness'. A life led only by those who truly believe in the magic of love. Awe stricken, I found myself, palm together, held in front of my gaping mouth, as the movie concluded. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
4473	Disappointing: Great movie, absolutely terrible transfer. Stay away from this! This is the latest of many copies I've bought for my wife looking for a good transfer. This isn't it!
4474	a reading meditation: A lovely little book; reading it is like a meditation. The woodcut art suits the Zen simplicity of the text well. After getting my own copy, I was inspired to give it as a gift to several friends (and will to several more). It's a nice reminder that you can find peace wherever you are.
4475	I love the Rabbit: The Rabbit corkscrew is my favorite. Personally, I use the Titanium Gold version, but the black or silver one is a better place to start for most people.MFQ...
4476	Story is well-written, and there is plenty of mystery, but--: I'm afraid that I still found this novel to be more depressing than anything else. Even given the time period of the story, and the fact that at that time some women who were not fit to be nuns ended up in convents, I found all of the nuns in the story to be such liars and so plainly unfit to be nuns that I felt the convent shouldn't have been left standing at the end of the story. It didn't seem to me that there was even one woman within the story who really should have stayed in the convent. Perhaps Lady Elizabeth and Margherita came the closest - by the end of the story - to becoming "real nuns."
4477	Groovealiscious: If you like to groove to some smooth tunes then this is the albulm for you. The pietasters mix that skankin punk sound with a pinch of swing jazzness that makes you want to shake your rump.These guys groove with style!
4478	Another Jill Marie Landis Hit: Lots of twists and turns in this one that kept me turning pages into the wee hours. Jill has once again sent her characters on their intricate journey filled with surprises around every corner. Romance, suspense, humor. This like, many of Jill's book, has it all. I'm looking forward to the next Kat Vargus novel!
4479	Better than Zagat's: good fun and useful. i really agree with what they say about places. they tell me about the restaurants, good and bad, not themselves. covers lots of places out in the neighborhoods. maps are useful for finding places. it's nice looking, too.
4480	Diane was against michael not good intentions of her part: I read the book, was not satisfied, I felt like Diane was out to get Michael, she made it sound like he was guilty. I read other books about Michaels trial and there were more realistic I felt she put allot of her ideas that dint really happen.She twisted the whole thing around. It dint impressed me at all.
4481	FLATLINE!: I Loved this show THEN and NOW to experience live. But sadly the revival recording is not half as exciting as the original even if it does have more stuff. It's too clinical and studied sounding. Repeating the dialogue ruins the flow and becomes tedious after one hearing. It's also magnifies why Miss D'Amboise as Cassie never became a first string star. She absolutely sounds like a cat being tortured. Pinched, horrible nasal voice and there's no hiding it even ion the group songs. SAD. I saw this revival and felt the same about her in the theatre. But the album is worth it for the voice of Tony Yazbeck singing anything.
4482	Way To Go Bruce: Bruce Cameron is a funny man. He also has two beautiful daughters who will not be speaking to him for a few years. Of course, in some cases, that is a father's dream. For one, it means that there will be no request for funds, more clothing, a car, or a larger bedroom.Little girls love their dads. Teenagers barely tolerate them. But, fortunately, once married they again "see the light," discovering that the "old man" ain't so bad after all.The contents of this book should sound familiar to any male who has teenage daughters. It may not solve your problems. But, it is comforting to know that you are not alone.
4483	BORING: Sorry, without being political at all I just thought this book was extremely boring. He spent more time talking about his childhood than he did speaking about some of the major issues during his presidency.Granted, most biographies can also serve as an opportunity to make excuses for past errors but I thought this carried that a bit too far. In addition, I felt he used it as an opportunity to "settle some old scores.
4484	This CD is just that - INSPIRED!: What a beautiful, uplifting CD by an amazing singer! Mary Haskell brings her own unique voice to wonderful old and new standards. The orchestrations and arrangements are fresh and exciting, bringing new life to some of my favorite songs. The entire team behind this project was definitely inspired!
4485	Don't bother buying: the speaker phone function is why I purchased this. The speaker part worked fine but the other people couldn't hear me. Not just barely but not at all! Had to use it for a conference for work so had to put up with it the whole time.
4486	Waste of great source material: The history of China, from what I have heard and read, is a fascinating story. Chinese history, like most other history, proves that the best stories are true stories. Unfortunately, this is lost of JAG Roberts, the author of this book.I purchased this book to get an overview of Chinese history. But it was incredibly boring. The author packs so much information in such a small space, nothing is explored with any detail, feeling, or creativity.A good historical writer will propose a thesis in the beginning of the book and support that thesis. (ex. "The Chinese Communists are a continuation of (or a break from) the old dynastic regimes" or even something so simple as "China has a long tradition of civilization") Roberts does nothing of the sort. The reader merely gets a confusing outline of dynasties, leaders, and events in no narrative flow whatsoever, all without a purpose.It is not even entertaining.
4487	Desk chair: I first saw this chair at my chiropractor's office. It really is comfortable, moves easily, and supports where I need support. I haven't taken it to the office yet -- my intended purpose -- because we use it at home.The only down-side is that I am 5'7" and it is really high enough, but I prefer a higher seat. But this works.
4488	Helped me post a new pesonal best lap at Laguna Seca: I am an amateur racer competing in SCCA regional racing.I found GOING FASTER to be a very useful textbook. The organization is excellent, allowing me to skip some basic information and go directly to the areas which concerned me the most. The clear an detailed description of exactly how a racing car is driven through corners helped me analize my own driving and improve my performance.The description of each aspect of racing starts with a technical foundation and then builds to a description of how to do it in the car. I am an engineer by traning, so this combination of a theroetical treatment with practiacl advice is excellent for me.I found the descrption of how things are in racing to be right on, and I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to try racing, as well as to the racer who wants to improve his or her perforamnce.
4489	Flat as a Pancake: I must give this company high marks for service and shipping. Product arrived on time and well packaged. The ball looked great and I was excited to get and use it, however it would not hold air more that 12-20 hours (sitting on table) No instructions were sent, but I'm sure there is no special trick to airing up a ball, is there?Unfortunately the company was in an out of stock position on this item, I would be willing to take a second chance on it.
4490	excellent paper: 60 photo glossy paper sheets for only 1 cent? AMAZING and THUMBS UP! you all should buy it because it is just of the same texture and same glossiness as the other expensive photo glossy paper ones. shipping and handling costs 4.99 dollars but hey it is still way way cheaper than the expensive photo papers! i recommend you guys buy this product. you will not regret it
4491	poor customer service & thin, breakable glass: The tea pot relies on a plunger system in the stainless steel filter that can be pushed down to stop the brewing process. The plunger has a rubber gasket (ring) around it that seals the tea leaves in the bottom inch of the strainer. I take the rubber gasket off to wash after each use.Unfortunately the gasket was thrown away by mistake so I called the company to order a new one. I had to leave a message since the computer does not have any live customer service. Actually I left several messages and emails to no avail. If I wanted a new gasket, I would have to buy a whole new tea pot. In the end it made no difference because the glass tea pot cracked in the dishwasher shortly afterward.I have since purchased the FORLIFE Brew-in-Mug Extra-Fine Tea Infuser with Lid on Amazon and been very happy with it. I gave several away as Christmas gifts too and they were well received.
4492	John Cougar: The CD was in excellent quality. The music is great. It's John Mellencamp starting to sing about his midwestern roots. Under-rated album
4493	Confusing & Useless Book: Please,Please,Please If You Love Your Hard Earned Money & Precious Time Dont Buy This Book(Even For Free).This Book Will Leave You Confused Wheather To Beleive In Things Described in The Book Or Not.Case Studies Are Good But Whats The Use ?If You Cant Make Your Mind on Anything.Better Try Some Other Authors.
4494	Good horror: Well written, not predictable. The ending is not disappointing as is often the case with horror stories. The bleak and desolate scenes are very well described, they come to life.
4495	Still working great: Has been working for a long time with no issues. I am very glad I bought this battery! Saved a lot.
4496	AWFUL PRODUCT: After a few weeks of using this product, the 'foam' totally flattened, so all the pressure was up against the wood directly. To add insult....the product snapped and broke, pinning my ankles under the chair...very painful. I would definitely not recommend buying this product.
4497	Great!: The battery did not blow up or catch fire, that's always a good start. I would buy from here again.
4498	Older, but wise!: This book copyright 1986 is an older book of instruction. Some things change in the world of writing but some things, I think, will never change and that's comforting! This book contains many helpful things to teach a new writer. It also holds many old pictures and illustrations that I found amazing to see. It explained how things used to be done and therefore in ways, is a historical book and full of wisdom. I am enjoying referring to this and it will be one of my treasures in the years to come.As far as being of Help to a new writer, I would say it is about a 6 of 10.For it's historical value and great material, I would rate it an 8.We can never learn enough about the craft we love!
4499	Isikoff's book is better: There's really nothing factually new here we haven't read before....which means the thrust of this book is Toobin's spin on it all. Frankly, that does not make for interesting reading and it's definitely not enough to carry an entire book. As you can tell from the other reviews, your own personal opinion on Bill Clinton will determine how you veiw this book - love Bill, love the book; hate Bill, hate the book. Still, I imagine even the Bill lovers tired 2/3 the way through this book.I think Michael Isikoff's "Uncovering Clinton" is a far better book for getting a handle on the whole Lewinsky affair.
4500	Works well - makes good coffee: This coffee maker does a very good job. It makes good coffee and it doesn't waste grounds. And the thermal carafe does its job. It seems a bit pricey, but I would say it's worth it if it turns out to be durable as well.
4501	Anne Stuart does it again!: Leave it to Anne Stuart to twist this plot line around (and around)and make it work. Tackling a bit of time traveling in a shorter book is difficult at best, making it work as spendidly as she did is a rare feat indeed. Brava, Anne!As another reader mentioned, I only wished it were longer so I could have enjoyed my time in the (multiple <g>)lives of Susan and Jake that much longer. I can't wait to see what she does next!
4502	Excellent Game- Near Perfection: I really REALLY wanted to give Giants a perfect game. After anticipating this game for over a year, It is everything I expected it to be and more! I would buy this game alone for the breathtaking graphics. If you own a Geforce 2 and dont buy this game it is a crime! This game gives u three totally different races each plays differently. Plus it also has boat racing and air flyinch machines, like 5 games in one! The reason I have it 4 instead of 5 stars is of course bugs which most were fixed in the patch, but most importantly multiplayer and no level maker. Multiplayer could have been the best ever for this, but it was quickly made with very little features, plus laggy! Too bad because a Starship troopers like mod on this would rule!
4503	Great gameplay, good graphics, and fun,fun,fun!: This game is HOT! it has outstanding gameplay.you can move freely about in a big boundry area, use weapons,like swords,knifes,your fists,and alot of other ausome weapons. The graphics are excepitional, but a little shaky at times.But other than that, it's great!I would say this game is for audiances 10+.I would not recomend this game for kids under 9.It has a little blood, but not very much.It is like a "fantasy,majic, and supernatural" theme all at once.Try it, you'll like it.
4504	Looks = tone?: This guitar is gorgeous. Drop dead gorgeous. The beautiful gold hardware really sets it off nicely.And it has the signature ovation "sound."I tried this out at the local guitar store, and the looks totally won me over, but the tone did not. Thin, tinny, and flat sounding isn't really my cup of tea, but I'd say this would be a fantastic live instrument, as the body is quite feedback-resistant..just don't bring it into the studio.To reiterate, this is a beautiful guitar, with outstanding live capabilities, but an unplugged tone rivaling that of a $100 small-bodied guitar.
4505	Best Toy Purchase You Can Make!: My 4 month old can't get enough of this! He's been loving it since he was old enough to see well. The mirror is his favorite part, and can be repositioned as needed as your child develops. Plenty to grab and explore, but not so much that he gets over-stimulated. The lights are great for tummy time, and the touch-activated music is a terrific bonus. The mat is easy to wash, and whole thing is super mobile and durable. Can't say enough good things about this toy!
4506	Stay Away!!!!!: These were absolutely horrible. They made my feet ached 10 times worse. I tried everything to make them work better (added cushion on top, used the lowest arch, etc) and nothing made them perform better. Atrocious. Painful. No way to get a refund. Just a gimmick that I got suckered into. If your feet hurt, see a doc, do some specific feet stretches and rest. Dont buy garbage like I did!
4507	An OK mirror with a tight scissor and easily unscrewing nuts: The mirror is well designed and functions properly (which is difficult not to do for a mirror). However, the scissor may be too tight if you plan to constantly pull the mirror in and out. Also, the nuts on the movable parts get loose after you moved the mirror in some direction (for instance, if you rotate it, the side nuts may get unscrewed without weekly? tightening).
4508	sliding bed: I just bought this air mattress because I read alot of positive reviews but am not satisfied with it. Everynight we inflate it we were comfortable but after an hour or so it would lose air and we would both start sliding toward the center. It was very uncomfortable when both of us ended in the middle. It would of pershaps been better to buy 2 twin size instead of a queen. I don't really recommend this product to anybody. Pershaps a twin for each person but never a queen for 2 people.
4509	Don't waste your money until the kinks are worked out.: I was initailly impressed with this device, but being an early adopter is risky and I ended up being disappointed in the end. Live video capture direct from my TV went well at first, then started to get fuzzy, flip and change color without explanation. Whenever I scheduled a 30, 60, or 90 minute record from the TV, it consistantly stopped recording at about 5-8 minutes. There was no conversion software in the box which enabled me to convert video formats to MPEG4, so I was forced to use freeware. After conversion, the device did not recognize the format. I bought this device to make long, tedious hours on the plane more enjoyable, but alas, if the MegaView can't accomplish recording tasks, it does me no good. Because this is a Japanese product, support is almost non-existent and even the website is sparse as well as difficult to navigate. This is a good idea that isn't quite done yet. Too bad. See ya in about a year.
4510	Webster ASL Dictionary: -Not a user-friendly program-Poorly oranized software-No configuration options at all-Impractical and slow unless you have a very fast CD drive
4511	did not get what I ordered: The order showed a picture of a TUB of Glycoflex 11 and that is not what I received. I got a laerge bag and a smaller bag.NOT WHAT I ORDERED!!!!!!!!!!!!
4512	sick! sick! sick!: Anyone that reads this book to their child should be ashamed of themselves. This book is the most disgusting thing I have ever read. This book is supposed to be for ages 4 - 8 years old. I raise my child to be a better person than these people that apparently think this is a book that is proper to be read to a 4-8 year old. My daughter brought this book home from her school library and asked me to read it to her. Since the book came from school I proceeded to begin to read it to her but stopped because I am not assanine enough to put discusting language like that in her mind. It is never o.k. to call anyone or anything dumb. Maybe I'm the only one that thinks so, but if that is true, then this world has become more sick than any of us thought. SICK! SICK! SICK! The only reason I gave this book one star is because I couldn't find any way to give it none or negative. SICK! SICK! SICK!
4513	does not accurately read the temperature.: In the winter time I started noticing a large discrepancy between the temperature stated on the radio and this thermometer. I brought it inside and put it in the refrigerator with a known accurate thermometer. At 40 degrees farenheit it was off by 3 degrees. I then put it in the freezer and at 0 degrees farenheit, it was 6 degrees off.At room temperature the temp is within 1 degree (acceptable).I have not checked the error with temperatures over room temperature.
4514	Not just for kids: I bought this CD because I have and love John Denver's other two Christmas CDs. I really don't like the Muppets very much, especially Miss Piggy. I expected to program my CD player to play only the John Denver songs. I was surprised that I actually enjoy some of the songs the Muppets do. John Denver and the Muppets make a surprisingly good combination.So, even if you don't like the Muppets, or if you've written this CD off as a kiddie CD, think again.Here's a tip to save you some money. If you don't already own John Denver's Christmas Like a Lullaby CD, buy A John Denver Christmas double CD instead of this one. It includes both the Muppet CD and the Christmas Like a Lullaby CD for barely more money than it costs to buy either one alone.
4515	I really liked it: This is probably the best sequel I have ever read to Phantom of the Opera. It has a nice ending that is really different that I sort of saw coming but wasn't sure until the end. It is really nicely written even if it has a few problems. I think the author must be a fan of the movie with Gerry Butler, but I have seen the play lots of times with different leads and so I don't need all of those references to that actor. Still, it wasn't distracting to the point it took away from the story. We talked about this book at our monthly meeting and just about everybody liked it.
4516	why send an adult childrens's underwear?: No where in the advertisement for this item did it say that it was children's underwear. I am now stuck with a pack of kids undies, which will cost more to send back than to keep.Very poor form!
4517	Very slow book that didn't make me care to read the sequels.: This was the first book by Card I've read and considering how popular he is, I was disappointed. Even though I'm non-religious, I really didn't mind the religious parallels that some other reviewers mentioned, because I thought they were handled in a good and believable way. But I was disappointed with the story itself. It starts out very slow and never really takes off until the last couple of chapters. And then it leaves you with an ending that just sets the stage for the sequels. This wouldn't be a problem if "Memory of Earth" itself was an entertaining book that made you want to read the sequels, but it didn't make me want to do that. For the most part of the book, I wanted it to end so I could start reading something else.I wouldn't recommend "Memory of Earth" and it didn't really make me feel like reading any more Card. But who knows, I may give Ender's Game a chance since people say that's his best.
4518	Didn't do it for me: I thought Ilium was a good start to this series, but Olympos just didn't do it for me. I agree with much of what has been said in previous reviews. I haven't seen one of my biggest pet peeves with this book mentioned yet, so I will mention it. It is the endless reminders that the "magic" used by the Gods is actually accomplished via science. It seems to me after you make that point early in the book that you don't need to mention it again and again every time Zeus fire off a lightening bolt. It doesn't seem like a God can walk down the street in OLYMPOS without some convoluted hard science fiction explaination trapsing slowly behind. Some people obviously enjoyed this book, maybe it is matter of taste. Dan Simmons is an excellent author, and I am sure there are many great books from him to come.
4519	Volume Control ??: The sound even at max volume doesnt sound loud or rich, compared to an iriver which I had returned for other reasons. I tried fiddling with the equalizer to no avail. the sound is clean though.why is the volume so low? worse, it varies across songs. the provided earbuds are awful for running.if someone has a suggestion for fixes, please suggest here.
4520	bad product: I can not give a good review of this product because the one I purchased does not work. I am now going to have to send it into the manufacturer for service. (I waited to long to call or I would have sent it back for a refund.) the only alerts that I have gotten are on the ku band, none of the other bands have ever alerted. the manufacturer had me reset the detector. But I don't expect that is going to fix it so now I will have to send it in for service. wish I had not waited past 30 days to call!
4521	Good for the first time guitar: We recieved this guitar and during the tuning a string broke, they do not give instructions as to how to replace the strings but they include two additional strings. It is a very pretty instrument and my son love it! For the price it is wonderful, and the additional items that come with it are a great little bonus: pics,stand,carrying bag,adjustable strap, and strings.
4522	Outdated and poorly organized: There is a lot of information in this book, and it is certainly helpful, but it's like reading a computer manual that is 5 years old. So much has changed in equipment and technique since 2006, I would not waste my time.Good book maybe to buy used (at a garage sale for 50 cents). I'm sure it was helpful in 2006, but any real experienced grower is already using methods or products that are not even mentioned in the book.
4523	This game is worth the search!: This game adds to the collection of any Metroid fan. Its fun to play just like any other Metroid! Even if you're not a fan you should give this game a try to immerse yourself into the Metroid universe! Which is awsome! I highly recommend this product!
4524	Teaching Students to Read Nonfiction (Grades 4 and Up: This is an excellent way to prepare students for state assessment questions. Students are exposed to the vocabulary and questions types that they need to become familiar with especially when reading non-fiction. Our staff and students used the articles regularly and find it to be very beneficial.
4525	Sigma 18-200 OS: Got this as a travel lens for Disney. Wanted 1 lens solution and this will fit the bill perfectly. Used the Tokina 12-24 with Canon 28-135 IS last trip, and while I got good shots, 24mm was too short on the Tokina and 28 not wide enough on the canon. Had to change lenses too often. Other than when I want really wide landscapes, I should be able to use this 90% of the time. I will still supplement with my Tokina for wide angle + small p&s; when I don't want to use the DSLR.So far, I'm really pleased with the sharpness of the Sigma and the range is great. Compares well to my sharp 28-135 in image quality. Images are sharp, although don't have as much "pop" but that can be fixed in post. Overall, I'd recommend for it's versatility and generally good image quality.
4526	A story with no sense: VERY Stupid movie. The story doesn't make any sense, totally waste of time for watching it. I like horror movies, but not this one.
4527	An unexpected must-see...: I had never heard of this play before I purchased it and I was pleasantly surprised. I liked it so much that I told my friends to go get it too. This play arrived at my house in record time and I recommend the item and seller to all.
4528	The GREATEST movie ever made.: Without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen. After living in Scotland for a couple of years and visiting the Wallace monument, only a movie like this can depict how horrid the English treated Scotland. You could say the best part about this movie was revenge. I say it was the general truth. FREEDOM!!!!!!!!
4529	A heartbreak for my son: Excitement was in the air! An early Christmas at the Grandparents netted my son this Hasbro Mission Paintball Game. Upon opening and plugging it in however it didn't work.The power was on, the screen came up and the gun would highlight a few things yellow, but to aim and click on them was impossible. Clicking on the letters ABCD to build your first player name would show on the screen YOUA or any other odd creation. Never what you were spelling.Trying to get it to click 'accept' also was a losing proposition. The Accept would highlight in yellow but go no further. Cancel, accept, letters. Nothing worked. From 5 feet away from the tv to 4 inches from the screen.I have a very disappointed son. And a husband that is going to try to return it today and get a new one, based on the other reviews... maybe we just got a lemon.
4530	slip cover bummer: This was not a good fit for me. It looks like a sheet on your chair, and even with some dryer heat to get it ironed it looks like a sheet. Also the Amazon prompted it could be returned to Target if you needed to return it rather then the normal return process for Amazon. This turned out to be the worse choice. Not only did I wait in a long line, then the Target associate was held up with trying to return this product, but the hassle got worse when the person she was talking to decided I can NOT return it to Target and shipped another one instead. This blocked my Amazon account for days, and I feel it reflected wrong information saying I could return it this way. I refused the new shipment or course, and after a few days could return it to Amazon with customer service and an apology email. Not to mention it's thin and ugly on the furniture.
4531	A little slow: I read all this book but it was an easy one to put down because it was slow and the plot was thin and the dialog repetitious! I found myself wanting to go to my library shelf to find a faster paced book that was a lot more interesting. I guess the simplest way to explain it is... It wasn't the most horrible book I have ever read but it wasn't the best either.
4532	Magnum Opus: This 1995 set of songs is a full and mature effort by the estimable Steve Forbert. The raw voice intertwines with lovely, delicate music on some songs-- exotic Spanish-style guitar on the softly moving "The Last Rays of Sunlight"-- and a more raucous arrangements on others. And the lyrics! There's a lot of optimism, but also some forays into loss and regret... "It Is What It Is and That's All" is a standout for music and words: "...you'll look backwards an' long for/ the things/ That you'll find it's then too late to do"; but while he can bring you up short with such a masterful turn of phrase, Forbert will always offer perspective and solace, as exemplified by this song's title. The only downturn for me is "Don't Talk to Me"-- too raunchy, seems misplaced here.
4533	They Should Call Avril "Average": She's not The Best But i Must Admit she's Better Then Some. She's got her own style and her own way of singing that I reapeat IS NOT PUNK! (Sorry but she's not.) This CD includes three of her best songs and popular singles, "Happy Ending," "Slipped Away" and "Don't Tell Me." Although in my opinion her first album was much better and easier to listen to.
4534	Good Product: The wrist pad could be longer for my keyboard tray, but it is a well-made product and I am using it.
4535	wonderful: Jose Gonzalez has a great folksy mellow sound that is bound to become popular. The songs on this album are consistently excellent. Definitely worth a look.
4536	Mind-Blowing: This is one of the most satisfyingly complete albums I've ever heard. Its like taking Cynic to the next logical level: No death metal vocals. The singer, Danishta Rivero, is a trained Metzzo-Soprano opera singer, and her sense of melody helps keep a sort of catchiness over the complex music that is reminiscent of both Cynic and Gordian Knot (two other bands f/Malone and Reinert). Santiago Dobles (who wrote almost all the music) is an amazing lead guitarist. How I'd love to see him team with Ron Jarzombek! Malone, as usual, is simpley amazing on bass whipping out several sharp bass solos and interesting rythmic lines. Sean Reinert is still one of fusion/metal's great drummers, utilizing his unique ryhthms and knowledge of the entire drum kit to provide a solid foundation for the other musicians. An excellent album by all means!
4537	I've never even successfully used it.: I attempted getting it calibrated, switching it different places on my person, etc. I couldn't get it to give me an accurate reading - and haven't successfully used it yet. My husband may have had better luck - I say try a more expensive model, but maybe I'm just not doing it right?
4538	Perfect!: Started working with markers and added these to my collection. The color comes out smooth, and the artwork is awesome. A must have!
4539	Very nice jacket: I am very surprised by how nice this jacket is. The outside is very soft, and the jacket has some stretch to it. I don't really think it runs big, I am a size 8 and ordered a medium and the fit is very nice. For a light jacket this is very nice, I wish they were still in stock, I would have gotten additional colors.
4540	Jill does it again!: I will always continue to love Jill Scott's work! She has a special gift of choosing producers and remixers to give all of her albums the right blend of music! She is also a true vocalist in her right! This album is a terrific value!
4541	Software is a disaster: I had Norton 2004 running on XP, never experienced a problem, so when it was time to renew my subscription I opted for this upgrade. Big mistake: it devours system resources, especially memory, slows processor speed to a crawl, made it impossible to connect to the Internet with Outlook, froze up IExplorer, and then, to make matters worse, would not let me either uninstall it or download the Norton remover utility. I struggled with the online help at Norton, fixed all the settings -- no go, and the darn program froze up after every adjustment so I had to reboot repeatedly. I finally got the removal utility off with another computer and voila, all the problems I'd been struggling with disappeared. Bad product, bad service, a waste of the nearly $50 I spent on it.
4542	Not good at all: I am using SMC products since last 1.5 years,I was satisfied with all other SMC products,but not this.Reason:- Its just running @ 2MPBS speed, thought my router is supporting 11 MPBS.- I called customer support, they are confuse too, asking all networking stuff to do again & again,but no luck. (SMC customer support is always better than N'gear & D'link)- I dont know what to do with this 65 USD baby?-also the size in the pictures look small,but its not real, size is larger than thumb drive.Otherwise, i hv good exp. with SMC products only this makes me crazy, but thats OK
4543	same, but good: dashboard confessional has been known for its breakup, guitar driven songs. they don't stray too far from their winning formula. this album is a nice, easy listen album. this album's been a lock on my cd player for awhile. try not to bother yourself with its lyrics, but its mellow, and soft guitar songs.
4544	i prefer Kremezi's Greek Island cooking book instead: Diane Kochilas says and I quote,"There is a certain elemental quality to all the cooking of Greece that seperates it from the cooking to the east and to the west, that is from the cooking of Turkey on one side and of Italy on the other."I am a gourmet cook and I don't know what Kochilas is talking about in terms of Turkish cooking. The Greek foods are heavily influenced by the Turkish cooking in fact it is hard to find dishes that are NOT shared by these 2 countries on either side of the Aegean. Many recipes in this book have Ottoman Turkish origins. Yet the author denies any Turkish influence. Sour grapes, Diane????? I think so.
4545	Not as good as their previous work....: Run-DMC no doubt have a legacy in this game, they changed the rules,saved aerosmith's career and went gold, platinum etc.And now they're back..what a mistake!! the cd is wack, you barely seem JMJ work on it and there's too much colaborations ( fred durst, kid rock, meth, big pun, nas..)and the result is disapointing.4 or 5 songs out of 12 really impressed me so it's less than half the cd...I like& respect run-dmc but they should retire..they r trying to prove that they still can burn the mic and rock the crowd, but times changes and they should now about it...
4546	Nice Value: The seller shipped this super quick, product came in excellent condition, easy set up, working in no time at all. Great deal and value, just what I was looking for. Did not get the full five stars because of the scan speed, but other than that very good product....
4547	Webster's Millennium Discovering the Human Body Gold: I have reviewed the Cds and have found them to wonderfully illustrated and very understandable. A wonderful way to study the human body.
4548	VHS to DVD: Instructions are not detailed much! I thought I would get everything I would need in the box to transfer my VHS to DVD, I ended up having to buy other needed items, still couldn't understand how to set up the VCR, computer and the connections. Then I bought another program which gave detailed info and sucess with 2nd product!I wish there were a way to contact the seller and ask questions about a product before a purchase!
4549	The title is deceptive: This book might be helpfull to a lawyer - I don't know, I'm not one -, but I did not read anything that could help me prevail "every place, every time"..."Discover the self", "the power of uniqueness", "the magical power of feeling"? Come on, give me a break! Worst of all, it's full of unethical tips that made me feel uneasy.
4550	Prime Time Stevie: Stevie Wonder was sure climbing the charts with this smash hit. Funky, soft, and slipery smooth, Talking Book has it all.Superstition has always been one of my all time favorite songs. Oh what a groove as the guitars, brass, drums, keyboards, and vocals all work together in harmony. Isn't that what its all about?Another song that always touches myself is the album closer, I Believe. It starts off as a poignant ballad but the fade out seems to bring out some grooving R & B tones and some optimism for the future.So many other great moments. Jeff Beck contributes a delightful guitar solo to the breezy Lookin' For Another Pure Love. Maybe Your Baby is another dynamic funky tune. What an infecious hook. You Are The Sunshine Of My Life is oh so joyful with such slipery smooth instrumentation.Certainly on the same level as Innervisions and Fulfillingness First Finale which is most definitely a very good thing!
4551	Get something else: This thing does what it's suppose to do, and that is keep clothes sorted. I received it with half a broken wheel, which inst worth trying to get a replacement. The wheel attachments are cheap as well. they don't fit snug. not worth $20, maybe $15 tops.
4552	Get rid of this one in your next garage sale: On paper, this book sounded great.In reality, it was long and boring, with no lovable (or even likable) characters.The plot was thin and forgettable, the emotions and relationships were very unrealistic.Skip this one, or sell it in your next garage sale.
4553	Old classics: Again, these were purchased for my parents, who are in their 70's and love these movies. Had nothing but good things to say about these.
4554	Wallplate: Not a lot of description needed here, they are brand new and in the original retail package. Great deal for me.
4555	Does not work: A pebble hit my beamer, made a speckle and it radiated with minute cracks. It was too expensive to get it fixed and replaced and my insurance didn't cover it. Tried this, followed everything to the letter and nothing!!! Hell I just put my parking sticker over it. Thank goodness the crack was located near the edge of the windshield.
4556	Don't end up paying hundreds of dollars in repairs.: Don't buy this TV (even if it given for a throw away price). You will end up paying hundreds for lamp replacements and repairs. This is a junk TV and I got burnt. I heard that there was a recall but when I called Panasonic customer support, they said I missed the deadline for the recall. They never announced the recall even thought I have registered my product on their website.
4557	A must for a Christian's library: Merrill Unger is a wonderful biblical scholar. His introduction to the book "Demon Possession and Allied Themes" confirms his understanding of spiritual warfare.
4558	easy living microvave: The book is very interesting , going to try several of the recepies. have not had time to try any yet
4559	An Acquired Taste: This anime is pretty bad. The story is pretty slow and boring and itjumps around a lot. It's also extremely graphic which I'm usually into,but it's done all wrong in this case. The music goes with the depressingfeel of the story, but is terrible in my opinion. The only things thatseem to be good about Shigurui are the visuals. The artwork is prettycolorless which makes it feel dull at times, but it's visuallyimpressive nonetheless. I would only recommend this to people who arefans of gore or people into swordsman homosexuality because that's whatthey'll find when they watch this.
4560	Rump Shaking Good: This DVD explores a specific type of stripping called "Shake Dancing." Before getting this DVD, I was not familiar with this type of dancing, but was amazed to see very (...), beautiful women doing it and explaining their views on dancing, club life and personal aspirations. Get this video if you're interested in seeing this type of dancing and an honest, probing look at how these performers feel about their profession and personal lives.
4561	What a WASTE: This kind of privacy film works very well. This particular brand of film works very well. The challenge is in getting the film off the backing paper.Once the backing paper splits and tears along the edge where you're trying to seperate it from the film, there is NO peeling it away from the film. If you try, the film itself will tear along with the backing paper.I did get the job done with the materials at hand, but...I WASTED MORE THAN 50% OF THIS FILM BECAUSE THE BACKING PAPER WOULD NOT PEEL AWAY FROM THE FILM WITHOUT TEARING.50% waste (at least) "built in" to the product makes it cost double the price.
4562	a must have album: this album is a masterpiece, a unique style, a unique voice. Every music lovers need to have this in their music library.
4563	This is a great buy: My favorite band is pantera, but, LB is on the rise to the top. They may be on mtv, but, I have to admit this is one of the best cd's I own, next to Vulgar Display of power. Buy it, all of the songs are good except nookie. You pantera fans may think that you cant like LB because your 'against the grain' but, buy it, youd be surprised.
4564	A good start: This is a great set of disks by one of the best songwriters of the 20th Century, but it sure leaves me wanting more. There are many hours of incredible live shows, covers, early songs, and strays from Townes' career, and someone really ought to put them together into a box that showcases the guy's talent as a performer. The studio albums show off his songs well enough but they lack nearly all the flavor of his live shows, being far slicker and more produced than anything you would have heard from the man at the Old Quarter or the Cactus Cafe. Still, this is a good start and an easy way to hear a bunch of fine music.
4565	The Masks of Flipside-review: Mr. Cadet has written a wonderfully poetic book of short stories. At the end of each story the reader is salivating for more. His witty phrases make you laugh as well as go out and use them yourself in your every day conversations. In a world where to many authors echo the same sentiment, his views are refreshingly different. I would recommend this book to all who enjoy a good story.
4566	Brak is great!!!: My Friends dad knows the guy who does brak (He works at a recording studio and recorded braks voice.)and he is the guy coolest i've met!This CD Is Great!!!Buy it
4567	Must Read for Clancy Fan's: Tom Clancy's latest is true to form. For diehard fans of JackRyan, John Clark and other Clancy characters, The Bear and The Dragon is a must read. Clancy flawlessly develops his intricate plot from multiple angles and the use of techno-speak is just enough to be factual without actually becoming an annoyance. The book is quite a long read at 1000+ pages, but its hard to put down nonetheless. Don't plan on buying it unless you have a little freetime! A couple minor criticisms arise from the several typo's I found while reading the book (editor's fault?) and a more racial slant in describing the villian of the book, China. While the Soviet villains of yesteryear's Clancy novels were easy enough to hate for their ideology and actions, I don't really find it necessary to throw in racial stereotypes to make a convincing villian. But, as I said, these are minor criticisms and I anxiously await another Clancy novel after devouring this one.
4568	Fatiguing And Unflaggingly Magnificent: Shania is beautiful and she's had a few hits produced by her famous producer/manager husband. This is a splendid collection of those country flavored pop anthems. Her voice is decent, but not exceptional, and she's extremely attractive too. The music enhances her physical attributes when she dances, and she always looks good in front of a camera, as opposed to behind it.
4569	Howie at his best: Alright for starters I must admit to truely experience Howie's music, you've got to see him live. Also, I will admit I'm a bit biased considering I'm best friends with his little brother and I've known Howie since I was 3. Howie's new CD is excellent, and I have to say that Les Hall(lead guitar, keyboard) is one of the most talented musicians I have ever seen/heard. It's amazing to hear what he can do on a guitar. The whole band is a great compliment to Howie and his looping. I strongly suggest you pick up his CD, especially if you liked Australia. You also get to hear some of Howie's piano playing on "End of Our Days". Overall, I must say Howie's CD is one of the best I've heard in years and it is definately worth buying!
4570	Not good!: We just got this toy delivered today. I unpacked it and handed it to my 12 pound Morky. We played for a few minutes then I turned around. When I looked back about three minutes later she had it in pieces. This was not a good toy at all.
4571	Interesting, dry: It has been a little over two years since I read Influence, the Psychology of Persuasion. From what I remember it was a very interesting read, though I found it to be quite dry from time to time. This definitely isn't bedtime reading material. The topics covered are all useful to anyone with an interest in the psychology of influence, and probably to anyone in the business/sales/marketing world. The examples and studies given in between the text are a joy to read. You'll probably find yourself discussing them with friends and acquaintances in between chapters. Even though the book can be dry at times I give it a high rating as a useful, insightful, and in depth look into, the topic of the book, they psychology of influence. Happy reading,-Zsen
4572	A little heavy for the little ones...: We bought this loader/backhoe for our four year old at Christmas. After reading the other reviews, I was a little skeptical about the assembly process. If you have put together a Peg Perego or Power Wheel project, the assembly of this is simple. The toy is a monster in size and weight. We found it a little hard for him to pedal it on anything but concrete, so we took the backhoe part off and now he has no trouble pedaling at all. Once he travels to his "work sight", we simply reattach the backhoe in order that he may complete his "assignment". Overall, a great toy that our son would probably eat and sleep on if we allowed him to.
4573	Hurrah for O'Connor: Each of these stories will take your breath away and leave you something to think about. O'Connor is a master at distracting the reader with humor so that the point of the story can almost be subverted to it. In the title story, "A Good Man is Hard to Find" the change in tone is as startling as a slap on the face. So beware! My favorite stories are "The River" and "Temple of the Holy Ghost." The protagonists in both are children, and O'Connor delves into the way they interpret the world (and beyond) in a most surprising manner. It will knock your socks off!
4574	Great action packed movie!: This movie was exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat. Although there was a bit too much blood for my liking. This movie almost makes you wonder, do vampires exist. Probablly not, but it almost makes you believe. Not only was the movie entertaining so was the soundtrack. What more can you ask for good movie and good music. It's definetly a must see.
4575	fliptop solitaire: i love my solitaire game. this is something i take with me to appointments and play when i'm sitting around the house or getting ready for bed. it is durable,it lights up and offers 2 versions of solitaire. must have for me and it is a well made game.
4576	This book will inspire wanderlust: Dove keeps you turning pages and wondering why you worka day job. This tale made me realize that everythinghas not yet been discovered or destroyed. Their are stillenchanted lands and places untouched by modern civilization.An excellent tale. Not recommended for the career motivatedindividual.
4577	terrible content: What a waste of money? Like most people, I bought this book for Gross Anatomy because it is so well-known and so pretty. But two weeks into the class, I had to resort to using big Moore and Grant's dissecter for both lectures and labs. This book is so disorganized that it is distracting. You'll be spending 15 min. trying to find the perineal cavity and it's nowhere to be found because the author seems to be more concern with presentation than content. I give this book 2 stars for its beauty but as we all know, asthetic quality doesn't mean squat in medical school.
4578	good value: great for the pricespeaker phone works like a charm....loud, clear....and phones look nice
4579	I have complete set now!: Charmed is one of the shows that was a hit with me from the start! Even though I can still catch them on TV, I had to have the complete set!Can't wait till a cold winter weekend to have my own Charmed marathon!My favorite storyline was the Cole demon/human story. I liked the actor so well, I have followed him to Nip Tuck and have all their seasons so far on DVD as well. In fact these are the only TV series I have bought.
4580	Awesome Album: This is my favorite album from Twilightning. A great addition to my music library and an all around excellent purchase.
4581	Fitness Made Simple: Six Pack Abs with John Basedow by John Basedow: I bought this for my son. He enjoys it very much and has quickly seen an improvement.
4582	THE FIRST IS THE BEST ALL IN GOOD FUN: The Love Bug is a very entertaining Disney Comedy and the 2 disc special edition which is included in this box set is excellent. The other three sequels are not as good, but still good family entertainment. If you find the box set at a fair prce,buy it.The Transfers aren't bad,but they could be better.
4583	Sounds too bad for these ears: I must say I'm terribly disappointed by what I heard on this recording. Despite what some others may say, the singing on this recording is, as I found it, very bad. Russell Watson just doesn't have the requisite technique for many of the numbers here and this lack of vocal finesse is not compensated by any interesting interpretation or a deep emotional identification with the songs.Of course, each of us has our own taste and background of music appreciation. Some may indeed consider Russell Watson's voice and singing to be "amazing". But to my ears, neither voice nor performance is up to standard. You can easily find thousands of recordings in whatever category of music and singing that surpasses what one hears on this recording, whether in terms of beauty of vocal timbre or interpretative insight.It'll only be our own loss if we just cling onto just one recording and singer and say that it/he is the best in the world. How irrational our world will become, then?
4584	Something you will not believe!: I want to say I can't wait for this to come out on DVD. I bet you din't know there was an unseen pilot episode on this DVD set that didn't air on TV. I don't know what it is about, but just know there is a Full House episode you have not seen yet!
4585	Works, easy to clean: Product works. Easy to use. Easy to clean if used with different people. Comes with video to teach also. The mini BBB is very useful.
4586	It works: This item is not the bright chrome color I thought I was ordering it more like a steel color and I was looking for chrome like you see on a rim of a model car?
4587	All I Expected, And Then Some: I knew a CD by Timothy B Schmit probably wouldn't disappoint me; I've followed his career for around 30 years through Poco, Eagles, and some of his solo efforts. With a voice from heaven (imagine Carl Wilson + Gerry Beckley) and fantastic arrangements and songwritng, this is a winning CD. Sure wish guys like this were played on the radio. Especially good is "Song for Owen"..as a father it meant a lot to me; as good as any song I've ever heard from a parent to a child.Best wishes Tim, for all the music you have given us over the years, and looking forward to many more.
4588	The best available, but needs a revision: If you want to climb at Potrero Chico or many other rock areas in Mexico, this is about the only guide around. It was a good first effort, but I look forward to a future edition, not only for more recent information, but hopefully for a more ambitious effort. Still, if you're going to PC, buy this guide!
4589	Great Compilation but NOT Original recordings: This 3 CD box set contains some of the greatest music of the time. The box clearly states: New Stereo Recordings by Original Artists. All the songs are indeed by the original artists, however, they must have been recorded by them at some latter date as you can hear the difference in their voices. So, if you are a Doo Wop aficionado and desire the original radio versions, this set is not for you. But if you would just like to hear these great songs by the original artists when they were further along in their careers, this is a fantastic set, especially for the price.
4590	I love these two in this movie.: When the DVD first arrived, I watched it every night for a week! I love the dynamics between these two. I also love the fashion. I never tire of this movie.
4591	Best Resource for Cooking Anything!: My friend gave me this a few years ago and it is my go to cook book for everything. Just pulled it out last night for a banana bread recipe. What is so great is that they go through the different methods they tried for cooking the item and then tell you what worked and why. I found this very helpful when choosing and cooking my first standing rib roast.
4592	Hard To Handle: The idea and size of the SanDisk is great but the control toggle is just to small. When trying to scroll through songs I would skip to the radio or another folder. The sound quality was great and creating folders and transfering music was easy. Although the files did not always transfer in the order of the playlist. I returned and guess I will have to save up for an Ipod.
4593	Stars need energy: The perennial favorite Brother 1240HL works hard for the modest price that fetches one of these machines. One of the most important reasons I originally decided to purchase this machine was to escape the netherworld of inkjet cartridges. With a rating of 1.6 cents per sheet, not only do you save money in the long run but you avoid scrubbing and cleaning and cursing every three months. Being that some competitors cartridges fetch upwards of 100$ this tidy component suits me fine and often I get more than my 3000 sheet rating.
4594	Great but broke easily: First off the ear buds sound great. The problem is they broke after normal, everyday use in a couple of months. The right ear bud no longer produces any sound. So I can't recommend purchasing these even after the low price. If Coby produced the exact same earphones in a reliable build I will be the first to buy them.
4595	GOOD TITLE AND SYNOPSIS - STORY ITSELF A FLOP: I had every intention to enjoy this book. It had a great story idea-being stranded on a deserted island with a nerd. What a great opportunity for the author to work on conflicts, romance, and smoldering love scenes.Instead, the protagonist is a cheap hillbilly whore that musters up anything but sympathy. Perhaps the book would have improved if she were to become SHARK BAIT!The only redeeming character was the nerd, although he was a little too wimpy for my taste.The synopsis had fantastic potential - but a hard lesson was learned: You cannot judge a book by its cover!THE AUTHOR DROPPED THE BALL!I'll be honest. I never finished the book. It was THAT hard to swallow!I only recommend this book for future romance novelists. This book will teach you WHAT NOT TO DO!
4596	A great Avant Puck work worthy of cult status: From the first line you know this book will be interesting at the very least. This was my first Mellick novel, so I really wasn't sure what to expect. I must say, though, I was pleasantly surprised.In just over one hundred pages, with many chapters only one or two pages long, Mellick achieves what takes most other writers at least two to three times the space. The writing gets straight to the point, no word is used without a reason.The story itself is unbelievable, but that is to be expected from avant punk writing. The outright absurdity may throw off some readers, but those who can get past the entire world committing suicide at 11:34a.m. on a Tuesday are in for one of the most exciting books they'll ever read.Mellick may not have the status of a Stephen King or a JK Rowling, but he is certainly worthy of a very large cult following.
4597	One of the funniest movies ever: I have watched this movie many times. Each time it never fails in the laughs column. Jack Warner as Roy L. takes the cake.
4598	The best music!!!!: I didn't realize that older music could be so cool. Over the past summer, I mainly watched the video just to hear the music. It was popular when it first came out, and I think it will stay popular now!!
4599	Rock and Ice UK offer safer instruction: Fairly good reading - but Rock and Ice offer climbing instruction that would get most people climbing in a weekend! I reccommend taking a course with them. Jump to: www.rockandice.co.uk and have a look!
4600	Maybe fine for scriptwriters, but not for the general public: Sure, the book has lots of stories, but he writes like an insider more obsessed with the process than the craft -- and he's not even that insightful about the process. In fact, Taylor never seems to have any point at all, rarely rising above a hack journalist's dialogue-splicing. Read William Goldman -- or other actual scriptwriter -- before tackling this one.
4601	Nice little coffee maker: I've had two Brew 'n' Go coffee makers. Each of them lasted about six years with daily use, which isn't bad for such an inexpensive little machine. It makes acceptable coffee. Not bad, not great. You can't tell much difference between brewing Maxwell House or a fresh ground gourmet coffee, but since I'm OK with Maxwell House for my weekday morning cup, it's fine for me.If you use the mesh filter that comes with the Brew 'n' Go, you'll get a bit of sludge in the cup. But a no. 1 filter is a little small for it, and a no. 2 is a little large. I usually used a no. 2 filter and mashed it in to fit.Since my last Brew 'n' Go died, I decided to try a small percolator, and so far, I prefer the percolator: hotter, stronger coffee; easier to clean; I can tell the difference between cheap pre-ground coffee or freshly ground "good" stuff; takes up even less counter space than the Brew 'n' Go (and looks cuter). But the Brew 'n' Go is a decent drip coffee maker.
4602	Not so good of a book: The analysis is weak. The criticism is unwarranted. The argument just does not add up. If you hate Friedman, you might like this book. It was written for a witch hunt.
4603	Excellent discussion of judicial philosophy: Justice Breyer clearly lays out the differences in philosophy between "textualists" or "orginalists" on the Supreme Court and those who view things in context and in the changed world. It is an effective counter to Justice Scalia, well worth reading.
4604	Don't waste your money: If you want to read about how to squeeze the worldly view of creation into the Bible, this is the book for you. Darwin would be very proud of this book. Jim, like most people, completely ignores the scientific facts that disprove evolution.If you want to read about the Biblical account of creation, and the science that the news media ignores, get "The Lie: Evolution" by Ken Ham.
4605	It kind of broke: Well let's see... I ordered this pen because I needed a wax pen for sculpting and this was the cheapest. I guess I didn't realize what I was getting, because this isn't something that is really useful for that. It has a thin wire tip, which is where the heat comes out, and if it's bent too often, it breaks,which severs the connection, i.e. no more working wax pen. Basically it was the cheapest pen I could find and it turned out to be worth about as much as I paid. So all in all,I'm not really satisfied with this product, maybe if it had thicker tip replacements or something it would be worth it, as of now it's not good. Don't spend your money on it if you're looking for a sculpting tool, just buy the expensive one that looks better.
4606	Amazing but emotinal: This is a awesome CD. I use to listen to it a lot, especally when my girlfriend and I were together. Our song was "Closet thing" now whenever I hear that song I cry. But this is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. Musically it's amazing, lyrically it's very emotinal.
4607	Comprehensive: This book has the needed information required for developing a web site. This book is all that is required to start up a web site (as far as web programming goes). If you are searching for a book to suit your needs, this one will do it. The author was even kind enough to reply to my questions, which is rare among authors!
4608	Avoid at all cost: absolutely awful. Do not buy if you have a PC, comes with no software to allow you to backup your data, the tech support insisted that it is sold solely as an external hard drive. none-the-less they do have software for scheduled back-up for MACs. why? who knows.the drive itself vibrates so strongly that i had to take it off my desk.
4609	crawl 'n flutter bee: This is my most favorite toy ever. My l year old granddaughter loves it as does her grandmother. She and I both enjoy the sounds and music and the after play when it has stopped. I have given it as a gift to several people. I like having it sitting around my living room where I accidentally hit it and the music plays - memories of little ones playing. Love it.Playskool Crawl 'n Flutter Bee
4610	all talking and no music: Yes, I did a mistake by buying. This DVD discuss everything about Lennon and around Lennon trying make impression on me but no luck.The bottom line is he maybe was activist and political activist and community organizer but results are zero as we see from other community organizers and we remember him as musician not politician and this part missing in DVD. Once in a while the producer give us short pieces of songs like 10 seconds trying to prove something. Propaganda!
4611	It is what it is!: Looking for an unusual but entertaining films on the gory side these are them. The actors are great and the movies done well.
4612	nope: The first two songs are good, but these same songs are on "Wiretap Scars" (their first EP) - get that insteadthe singing on the whole EP is not very good, but the guitars are kinda cool.The 3rd song is fairly generic and the last track is just blatant filler - a stupid drumbeat with some low-fi noise...the sleeve artwork sucks, too1 and 1/2 star
4613	10 year disposible watch: Excellent watch for any environment. Trust me, for the money this is the best work watch you can buy.
4614	One of the worse: This was something cheap they made to give out for buying their product. It is just a plain and simple bad product
4615	Living doll: Kris' sister Lindy is into ventriloquism and Kris is jealous of the attention she gets. She decides she wants her own dummy. But when she does, weird things start happening. Could it be the dummy?I've never cared much for stories about living dolls. This one is no exception. The story and the ending is nice enough, though, if you like that sort of thing.
4616	Editing is unacceptable: I cannot count how many times I have watched this movie since it was first released way back when. I saw it in Cinerama and have seen it non-Cinerama. Unfortunately the seams people complain about are inherent in any Cinerama transfer to "standard" format. Until a complete digital remastering is accomplished this will be normal.What I did not like about this DVD is that it is edited. Why would a DVD release be edited is beyond me. Similar to the editing of the Alamo, minor pieces being removed are not noticed unless you have seen the film in its uncut version. Editing a DVD release is not acceptable.
4617	Not worth twenty minutes of your time....: I read this book for my book club - and I wish I didn't. It is written at about the fourth grade reading level. The liberties this author took with the bible is astonishing! Why don't we just all rewrite history to suit our feminist whims and be done with it!? This was hugely disappointing. I would have preferred she make this a fictional story about that period of time instead of insinuating it is a woman's version of the bible. What dribble, what gall! Consider this a badly written romance novel with a great PR machine out there trying to sell it. Horrible!
4618	HORRIBLE!: I thought this video was a waste of money(even though it was a gift). He is the worst instructor. He basically doesn't explain barely any of the moves and just shows you the dance with counts. You would get the same affect from watching the music videos and pausing and slowing and rewinding. He goes through the moves so quickly, going over it about once. They are trying so hard to make this video look cool with cheap camera effects that it makes it hard to follow along with him and the dancers. Half of this video is just him talking about himself and his career which I personally fast forwarded through. So I deeply do not recommend this video. Fatima's video was much better, at least she teaches it to you.
4619	Really - Read the reviews.: I read the reviews and still bought this and the shed for my bob the builder fan. This stuff really is terrible. My son wanted over and over to build the house as shown on the box - it can't be done.You just can't build anything - not even the face of a house. Not even because the magnets do not hold but because there aren't the right shape bricks.He uses the bricks now as Skip's load but surely there are cheaper things for Skip to cart around! Also the Bob the Builder Shed is terrible - I super glued it together in the end as if you just touched it, it fell apart. The vehicles and die cast characters are A+++ but the other stuff is utter rubbish. Get Wendy and Bob on e-bay!
4620	Good Tea...: Its not always easy to find any Celestial Seasonings Black Tea in the local stores so when I found this on Amazon for less than I usually pay when I do find it I subscribed to a case of six every four months which works about right for me with a substantial savings. Its the closest tea to Fast Lane which you can only buy direct from Celestial Seasonings. I enjoy a cup or two almost every night.
4621	Dismal and disappointing. I'd give it 1/2 star if possible.: As a true Koontz fan, I was so terribly disappointed in this trite, disgusting book. It really does not seem possible that this book was written by the same man who wrote Fear Nothing, Whispers and Watchers. The basic plot could have made an interesting read, but the execution was faulty, stilted, and unfunny. What happened?!!
4622	heavy riff death metal!!: to all who listen to death metal this is a must in your collection!!!! this is there second and just a great job with the music....heavy simple riffs that will blow you away!!!! buy the album to get there address to get there first album!!!
4623	be warned: Be warned i bought this for my friend and he has a mac. a day later he texted me back saying if i had the receipt because it did not work. DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A MAC
4624	beware the gap!: When playing standard audio CDs, there is an audible gap between tracks! So if you are listening to Dark Side of the Moon, Sgt. Pepper, Kid A, or virtually any live album, you'll be subjected to a dropout during what should be a smooth transition between tracks! Really irritating to say the least. I've never heard of a player having this problem, and as far as I'm concerned it is unacceptable and inexcusable. I thought maybe I had a defective unit, but upon contacting the manufacturer, I've been told that it is normal for the sp90, and nothing can be done about it. I returned mine immediately for a refund. I don't know if the other rio players have this flaw. And by the way, the 120 seconds of skip protection applies only to mp3s---standard audio cds have a maximum of 40 seconds. Buyer beware!
4625	Lentek mouse repeller: I bought 3 of these "gadgets" for my caravan as it is closed over the winter. I placed them end of October and when I opened up in April the place was infested with MICE. They had chewed up pillows and cushions and there were droppings and mess EVERYWHERE. I killed 7 with the old fashioned cheap and cheerful snap traps. The Lentek device is a WASTE OF MONEY!!! THEY DO NOT REPEL MICE AT ALL.

4627	filter for vaiable speed pump: This filter was recommended by Hayward and x-10 as a fix for the electronic noise the Hayward ecostar pool pump produces that interferes with x-10 wireless modules. Even though the filter is advertised as 220v, it only filters one leg (110v). If you need to filter both 220v legs you have to buy two filters with no guarantee that it would work. Never-the-less, it would only provide sporatic filtering capabilities when the pump ran at low speeds and none at higher speeds. Essentaily useless for this application.
4628	Jackson 10 Dead/Alive 0: Peter Jackson's second feature, a Muppet/splatter movie, is delightfully made and excellent fun for anyone with a warped sense of humour who always found the Henson creations cloyingly wholesome. But the movie deserves better than this pitiful Dead/Alive issue which looks awful and ignores all the possibilities of DVD. My old VHS copy looks twice as good. Avoid this release but get the movie - when someone who knows what they're doing puts it out.
4629	small links: be careful to have the right size of lock: The links are quite small, so make sure you have the right size of lock to go with it.Other than that, that's a chain :-) nothing much about it. It seems to be fine.
4630	Terrible: Terrible book. Oversimplifies something that is can be genuinely important to most people. The way it is written is totally patrionising and ridiculous. Anyone with any common sense wouldnt need to read this. Im sure there must be much better books on managing and accepting change around that offer real words of wisdom.
4631	Mr.Valentine...: I recommended this book to a friend of mines and she bought it, no complaints as soon as you recieve this book into your hands your eyes will emmidiately will be dragged into the reading pages of vicky lewis thompson, the novel is excellent!!!!YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK , IS A MUST READING MATERIAL!!!!!!!!with hot steemy passion and sweet chocolate rappers this is a must read!!!
4632	Great if you have ADD, otherwise pass on this: Agree with other reviewer - horrible editing, cheesy effects - what was Joe thinking? I'd go with either of his other two live DVDs over this any day
4633	Too tedious for words: If Ayla was really as smart as she's supposed to be, she wouldn't be appearing in any more sequels.The love triangle is straight out of daytime TV: "he acts one way, but for some reason I'll just assume he feels completely the opposite". Ayla's accent is continuously described as too small to notice...but everyone does the instant she opens her mouth. Everyone in the book is just great, except for the token one-dimensional bad-guy who turns good in the end.These savages are so elegant, we expect to see a pre-historic Martha Stewart behind the next mammoth hide. Ayla is already Amelia Earhardt, Joan of Arc and Mother Teresa rolled into one. Read it if it's the only book in the house (this includes the dictionary and the phonebook).
4634	Would be nice, but . . .: . . . (a) I already own all the movies on Blu-ray disc in extended versions of all but the last two, as well as digital via iTunes, (b) the set is really quite expensive, and (c) all I really want on Blu-ray now is Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 in extended versions! That would be a satisfactory way to complete my collection.
4635	Honestly, one of Chow Yun Fat's finest acting jobs.: I was really surprised at how good this film was. Chow Yun Fat was absolutely mesmerizing. Both he and Mark Wahlbergh create an unexpected chemistry between their two characters. This is a lot more restrained in the action department than the usual John Woo directed gun fest, but it's actually a welcome respite from the cartoonish violence in most of Fat's films. Robert Foley, the director, struck a good balance: There is enough action and acrobatics to satisfy most HK action fans, while a strong plot and good performances round out the rest of the film.This is a good American crossover for Fat's cool charisma and tragic hero character.
4636	I'M THE SMOKING GUN WITH FINGERPRINTS: Terrence (Siaka Massaquoi) and Angel (Keena Ferguson) are a married couple who engage in role playing. So there are times you ask yourself what is real and what is set up. They come home one night and Angel gets attack (?) in what was a really poor scene. There marriage goes on the rocks as friends and detectives are called in to fill a movie with talks about relationships, roles, good men, good women, etc. The dialouge was boring and poorly delivered.The drama centers around Angel and her moping and inability to cope with anything. I didn't care for any of the characters.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, rape, sex talk, no nudity.
4637	Excellent reference: If you want real world knowledge buy this book. This is not a CCNA "how to pass the test" book; this is an "everyday usable" book. It helped me much more with my work than the Lammle CCNA guide. Very helpful for day to day operations.
4638	no help: nothing has changed my cat still something use litter box sometimes not. vet stated that ny cat was stree and her age..suffering frim anxiety stress whatever
4639	More words -- yes!: For word-lovers especially! Another merry romp though our English language. Author discloses archaic words and their definitions. For instance, scuttlebut was the water barrel around which passengers gathered, like our latter-day water cooler. Oh, do delve into it -- there's SO much more.
4640	Send your Claria ink epson Printers back.: Epson new Claria Ink Printers Suck INK like Monica LewinskyAll us Epson users should buy the R260, R380, or RX580 and then print like crazy till ink runs out (25 or 30 8.5 x 11) and return for a full refund to dealers who do not charge you on a return with ink all used up. Some do and some don't.That way Epson will get the message on this series and change something. $3 to $4 ink for a 8.5 x 11 plus paper price plus your time isn't worth it no matter that the print is great. All us pros and semi-pros should boycott Epson for a while!
4641	Very Interesting Book: This is a book definitely worth reading. Interesting to get the insights from someone who has been where the author has. The writing is far from mindblowing, but the story will keep you turning the pages. Not sure if I believe everything Collins wrote in this book or not. If what he says about warning the federal government is indeed true, well, it doesn't surprise me a bit. After reading the book you probably won't think much of this guy whether you're a Chechyn fighter or a conservative American. After reading this, you will have learned some things you most likely didn't know, some of which will shock you.
4642	Not this version!: Do not purchase this 2009 version!... It is not the original! My best advice is to purchase the 2002 Version.Why?... Well basically, you will get better definition image, subtitles!!! and much better audio definition!...I bought the original first, and then wanted to give as a gift the new version to my father... Oh surprise, I had to give my father my original one and return the 2009 Version.So, I hope you get the point, you deserve to see Rieu's performance in the original Version!
4643	Small, easy: I love the retractable product because it takes up virtually no space when I'm not using it and no extra cords hanging around.
4644	Mary Higgins Clark Does it again!: Just another great novel from MHC! I have been a MHC fan for many years of satisfied reading. She seems concerned about her characters and surroundings being believable to her readers, I like that. She made us believe the MP in All Around the Town. I like her short chapters that make you keep on reading and reading and reading! I hope she writes novels as long as I am able to read! I just found Amazon and am very pleased to find Eyes! I spent lots of time watching the book stands for MHC novels and now Eyes can do it for me! If you like suspense novels you will love MHC! Try one and you will be hooked
4645	Drove me crazy: Without knowing it I fell under the spell of the first bunch of songs and couldn't play another CD for days. An old love had resurfaced in my life to no avail and the music swept me into gut passion.
4646	crystal clear voice reception,compact (small): I have a set of these 2 way radios and they are excellant. My wife and I use these when we go to the mall,or when we go on a trip with another couple using 2 cars. My dad and I also use these on our 120 acre farm.When driving in cars reception is good up to a mile.When using outside around hills reception range seems to be around .7 to a mile.When using outside in ideal conditions (flat land, a way from power lines) reception seems to be around 1.8 to 2.2 miles.This unit is small and fits in the palm of your hand. These units uses AA batteries which lasts up to 30 hours.
4647	simple the best: One of the best albums of all time.. Buy this record now.. No one in the UK or the US for that matter can touch this release.. It really moves me..
4648	Nice Book: Nice book, no pornography, just sex as a human being. If you want something very explicit or unusual is not the right book...
4649	LOVE LOVE LOVE: I ordered this based on reviews and it holds up to what everyone says. I am currently a 38DD and the "girls" are supported. I didnt have problem with them hurting bit was embarassed when they bounced all over the place. The sizing chart did say for me to get a size 3 but i ordered a 2 and it holds good!! Happy girl!!
4650	Terrible Rip Off: I have tried 3 of these irons and non of those currently sold by Target work. The first quit heating after a few uses. The local Target was very cooperative and exchanged it. The second unit didn't work out of the box. The unit's auto shutoff feature would shut the iron off after a couple minutes usage - even while it was being used. At the risk of being pretty naive, I again exchanged the iron. The third did the same as the second. So, this time I called the manufacturer, Euro-Pro. They wanted me pay to have the iron repaired and indicated that it would take 8-10 WEEKS to get the unit returned. It is too bad that their quality control is so bad because, when the iron works, it does a quite good job. This is a bad company making a very inferior product.
4651	BAD PRODUCTO BAD TOILET SEAT: AFTER JUST 3 MONTHS THIS PRODUCT BROKE, JUST BROKE ON ONE SIDE OF THE SEAT, CAN'T RETURN, DIDN'T SAVE THE OLD TOILET SEAT...HELP ME PLEASE
4652	Disspointed: When this cologne was popular I would use it liberally and it smelled great.Not so today.I purchased it sort of like you would buy an oldie music album. Nostalgia modivated me.But the smell is more alcohol then aromatic scent that I remember it being.If you get nostalgic for Grey Flannel buy an old music CD instead.
4653	Finally, The truth is told: Every one should watch this movie, muslims and non-muslims, esspecially at times like today. ones again do every one a favour and get the movie, i can't express that enough.
4654	my wire broke too - got new wire - broke again!: Double whammy. My wire broke too like other people. They were nice enough to send another free wire which was great, but the wire broke again after about 2 months of use both times. I weigh under 180 pounds. After reading all the similar reviews it seems this product needs to get a new design with a stronger wire. Until this gets sturdier, I wouldn't waste your money for this poorly designed equipment.
4655	Didnt like: I am not big chested. I got this in a 34B/C, which is my size, and it was sooo tight! Love their bras, not a fan of this tank. I use the undercover mama tank and hook it to the Bravado bra, which has worked great for me.
4656	Everything you will need to know: This DVD set will make holiday planning great fun and the tips and directions are spot on. Martha is very serious about accuracy and planning and she always has great ideas.My favorite idea was bloody mary seafood shooters what a great thing my whole family enjoyed.Another favorite are all the CHICKEN dishes. One for any occasions. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who cooks and loves great food. This will also make a wonderful gift for someone who is trying to learn the basics and needs help and ideas like a new bride or college student.
4657	One of the greatest book i've ever read!: This book had a great and odd beginning to me. I started to get into the book at the very beginning. The storys characters were having their ups and downs and conflicks and then the book had a drastic change, one that I didn't even see coming! And from that point i was totally blown alway. From begining to end i didn't want to put the book down; i was in my own world. Every time i started to read it, i entered a whole new world it seemed. I forgot where i was! From begining to end it was great! Even now whenever i see the book just lying there, i can remember the whole world that is contained in it!
4658	Dr. Yoo: Brilliant organ regenerationist, or agent of conversative music?: When I saw this item, I knew that I wanted it. It combines three functions that are ever so rarely found together. And at such a price!1. Organ regeneration. Well, I was born with only of a small organ that most people have two of. Enough said. Wouldn't it be seriously cool, not to mention bilaterally symmetric if I could grow another?2. Guardian angel. Though I typically picture my GA as a somewhat nerdier version of Clarence, the benefits of a non-imaginary angel certainly caught my fancy. You'd be able to take him/her/it with you, though probably not through airport security, and leave him/her/it on your desk during those important (salary) negotiations. Think of the impact!3. Guitar pick. I enjoy experimental music, and perform the same whenever my schedule allows. (Which hasn't been recently, darn my lazy butt.) Think of using this gold-plated beauty to pluck those six strings.
4659	Hot water when you need it.. soup too: This is not the first time I have purchased this item. I had one that lasted years, then I broke the lid, I replaced it with an off brand and was sorry. I bought two this time, and use them in my shop and at home... Keeps my tea water hot, and makes excellent soup at lunch time.....well worth the cost.....
4660	Authoritative, concise and practical: As a practising oncologist, I own a whole personal library of oncology books. I find this book easy to use and sufficiently authoritative as well as up-to-date for quick reference and reminders. Compared to the standard large textbooks, it restricts discussion to only the most relevant and frequently quoted studies, but this should make it ideal for the trainee doing his/her revisions not to be too bogged down by details. Among the "shorter" textbooks/manuals, this is definitely the best.One notable problem however relates to the faulty 'binding' of book, and both my paperback copies (one kept in my office, and the other at home) fall apart within weeks of purchasing. Publishers take note !!
4661	Enjoying John Mayer's music: John Mayer's uncanny ability to lyrically touch upon the many facets of falling in love has made me fall in love with him!I love his acoustic guitar playing. Overall, there's not a song on this album that I do not like. Interesting fusion of jazz and ballard rock.After this album, I'm certainly a fan.
4662	Falsification of History: The book is a very sad example how an author can misinterpret historical facts. It is unique in a sense that it was written by a non-Romanian (?) but still author's view is perfectly matching with the nationalistic view of the Romanian historians. The book plays a close attention how the Hungarian repressed the Romanians in the middle age, although nationalism did not existed until the french revolution (XIX century). Beside that between the fifteenth and the early nineteenth centuries Transylvania was ruled by either the Ottoman or by the Hasburgs indirectly.The book almost disregards the Saxons (German ethnic group) who played also an important role in history of Transylvania, but after the second world war they were fully expelled from the country. Since such a fact can be quite awkward for Romanians they simply disregard them from history.
4663	Super tiny: I guess I should have measured out the 10" but I was expecting much stronger, longer cords. These are very tiny.
4664	Simply potent: This definitely outdoes any French existentialism. It is a simple book. A simple plot, simple language but so overpowering and insightful that it is a miracle it is never mentioned along with Sartre's Nausea. READ IT! but keep your therapist's phone number handy!
4665	A great collection of undead tales: Excellent short stories. Some of them have been more exciting and fulfilling than whole novels. Definitely worth every penny. If you're at all wavering, stop and just take a small chance on this book. You will be most pleased with your purchase.
4666	Should be better!: Yes, the steel base is fairly well made and solid, but I can't give the entire product more than 2 stars.The three issues I have with this unit are:* The wheels are really cheap. I expect I'll be changing them out before long.* The brakes for the wheels are very poor engineering. Yes they work, but come on is this the best the POWERMATIC engineering staff can come up with? In this instance I am using the term engineering loosely!* The price charged for this item is out of line with the quality of the materials and quality of the manufacturing. This item is more along the lines of a HF unit selling for $29.99.To my fellow rater, "No it isn't you. One expects a level of quality above the rest when they purchase a POWERMATIC product, unfortunately for the consumer POWERMATIC did not deliver that with this product!"Yes, it could be better, but it's not and because it's POWERMATIC it should be better!
4667	Warning this book is Plagiarized ........: ......from the book "Three Books of Occult Philosophy" By Henry Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim with some additonal material form other sources. I have takeen the time to go over a large portion of the book, and see little to no origonal work. I recomend that you avoid this book and buy the works of Agrippa. The Llewellyn edition is well edited, and has comprehencev foot-notes.WECA Magus
4668	really good: this book is very good...if you follow it, the book is life changing. I havent finished it yet but it was recommended to me and i hope to finish soon.
4669	Fanstastic compilation, but mismatched Amazon MP3 versions: A fantastic compilation to be sure, but don't by the MP3 download! Amazon cocked it up by putting the Crocodile LP version of "Pictures On My Wall" on Disc 1, not the original Single version. There are probably other inconsistent versions lurking here as well.
4670	Worked less than 6 months: I bought this watch winder for a Christmas 2007 present for my husband and it worked great for about 4 months. I contacted the seller for a replacement and they will not respond to my requests. Do not waste your time on this watch winder.
4671	Works like a charm: Just plug it in to a USB port and Windows XP immediately recognizes the mouse and away you go. Feel of mouse is fine although it is smaller than a normal size mouse. The only con about this mouse is that you must unplug the USB transmitter to turn it off but other than that it works great.
4672	DVD quality ploor: The story lines of the two seasons were excellent, as well as the acting. Having seen these originally on TV, however, it appears some of the Mystery intros were deleted. Also, the DVD production quality was very poor: there were pauses, skips, and what might be slippages in both sets. I doubt I would purchase any DVDs from this production company again.
4673	Awful.: This movie starts off okay, but descends into awfulness quickly. My favorite part was in the first five minutes of the movie, when Ashley Judd tries to open a bottle of wine with her teeth. Please don't watch this movie. There are 0 bugs in this movie, just in case you were wondering. This movie doesn't even qualify for the "so bad it's good" category. If you want to watch an interesting psychological thriller with good acting, go watch the original Sleuth. Or Twelve Angry Men. Or Point Break.
4674	Okay, but Kinda Weird...: There are some things that I liked about this expansion pack, and then there are many things that I did not care for. I DID like being able to have the new jobs, more lots, and some of the objects. The things I did NOT like are the weird objects, wallpaper, floors, and the list goes on. I actualy ended up selling this expansion pack to one of my friends, and he kinda likes it. If you want an awsome expansion pack, then you should get House Party. House Party has some things from Livin' Large that I liked, such as the the jobs and lots. I think that Livin' Large is an expansion pack for the Sim player that likes to make weird families, but if you want normal families like I do get House Party.
4675	With all the selective editing, ...: it looks like it was written, directed and produced by Andrew Breitbart.Bill, I'm surprised you didn't edit the orthodox Jewish guy out completely since he didn't let you put words in his mouth. Dude must have had experience with FOX News.
4676	Exciting & thought-provoking book!: This book will really make you think! Science-fiction or science-fact, you decide!
4677	My Favorite in the series so far...: Story Rating: 5 Wine GlassesAudio Rating: 4 Wine GlassesThis is probably my favorite in this series so far. I really enjoyed all the twists, turns, and swerves that the case took. In true "is it a good mystery" fashion, I did not guess the ending in advance. That being said there was a part about the ending that irked me but it was still done well. The plot and pacing were fantastic. At no point did I think the story stalled or was unbelievable. We got more Isles in this story which is good because up to this point it has been mostly Rizzoli. I am hoping in the future the books are more balanced with both. They really are a good team together: both loving their jobs, being good at it, and being women in a male dominated field without it being a big issue.I would highly recommend this book to fans of thrillers. I don't even think you really have to read them in order as you would only miss a few things and those are not part of the case.
4678	* 4 . 95 STARS * (alert) READ ASAP: Go to any local bookstore NOWread the initial excerpt (theres one on her publishers website)( describes her kidnapping(from a beautiful and close knit family in the remote Sudan) by the arab muslim slave traders)you WONT be able to just put it back down again and walk away....This needs to be read here and now, by everyone.The editors have already described the memoir so I wont bore anyone by repeating it, so just let me say thisI am predicting that this book is going to be winning some literary awards.Hey Mende, if youre reading this, I thank God that youre free and I will pray for a happy life for you from this day forward. There IS good in the world, you can be sure of that. Just look in the mirror.....
4679	Please Buy: There is everything else and there is This movie...you need to buy and preferably, from this seller too. thank you
4680	Not Actually "New": This DVD was released in March 2010, but all the episodes on it have previously appeared on other DVDs from 2006 and 2007. When something is advertised as a new release, the assumption would be that the material on it is actually new. I kinda feel ripped off.
4681	disappointed: While researching MP3 players for my teenage son, I read the reviews about this one. Some said it was great; some said it was a piece of junk that didn't work from the get-go. I decided there were enough favorable reviews to give it a try, so I ordered it, wrapped it in Christmas paper, and held my breath. It was just what he wanted (yippee for Mom!), and worked great -- for a little over 2 weeks. Then it froze up on the initial screen. Nothing we tried worked. So I sent back to Amazon returns the other day, and will look for another MP3 player, since they don't have any more of these in stock. I'm really sad about it, because my son said it was really easy to load songs onto, and even easier to use.
4682	Disappointed its not in widescreen format: As for the movie, I loved it as a kid and I love it more now....and I expect more as an adult as well. With the hefty pricetag of a new DVD edition, I expect to see the entire film, not a cut-up version, formatted for the small screen. Imagine...Chitty Chitty floating blissfully through the sky, and most of the sky cut out! The stately castle scenes, with half of the scenery cut out! How disappointing!
4683	Falls Appart: Mine fell apart. The clip's pin must have snapped and slid out, because if that's not the case, then they designed the case very very poorly. Last week I almost lost my camera after not hearing the case fall off, and went hysterical. (It later turned up.) You'd figure name brand stuff would have some quality. After dealing with the thing falling apart and putting it back together, and over again, I finally lost the little metal pieces the last time it fell off my belt, and now I'm in the market for a new case. I really liked this one because it attached to the belt and was designed to complement my Exilim Z-70. I initially liked it so much, that I might give it another chance. Caveat Emptor.
4684	The Stomp (The Soul Assassins Collection): This title and the other DVD's that came up with the search, as well as the lack of information can lead one to believe this is a video starring the group "Stomp". It is, in fact, a martial arts film that has nothing to do with music. I did not watch it, so this review isn't about the content of the video...just a warning to potential buyers. I bought it under the "new and used" section and was told by the seller that in returning it I would have to pay a re-stocking fee as well as all shipping charges which will probably amount to the price of the video. More information about the DVD could have prevented this.
4685	Epson has become a disappointment: I chose Epson because I like the durability of the ColorBrite ink. However, I will not be buying another Epson in the future. My last Epson died when an ink tube got clogged and it was too difficult to troubleshoot on my own. This printer has to be constantly run through the head cleaning process, a problem I have noted in other reviewers' complaints. It also seems to have problems with the paper feed from time to time. Ink runs out quickly, perhaps due to the constant cleaning. And it is frustrating to only get poor quality B&W copies. Enough already! I'm switching brands!
4686	Gripping story. Gratuitous nudity and sex.: I was hooked by the first episode's premise and great writing. The story is really good, with twists and turns and well-developed characters. But as someone who finds even soft porn disgusting, the first 4 or 5 episodes were over the top. Too bad Showtime feels the same need as HBO and others to exploit their freedom in that area.
4687	not very good quality: this product hasn't last very well at all. i've had it for under a year and the front plastic plate fell off, the remote control stopped working and the alarm icon randomly stops showing up on the front from time to time. also sometimes even when my alarm isn't set it still goes off. and sometimes when my alarm is set it doesn't go off! very frustrating, i will not be buying this product again!
4688	What's wrong with some of these reviews?: Why should a great guitarist/musician/singer stick to just one genre? What, do you only sing Godsmack songs in church? Only listen to Megadeath at a funeral?Cross-overs are appreciated by many and they never get redundant. Is rock music the ONLY type of music you listen to? How boring you must be. Broaden your horizons...come loose, be freeThis CD is great for mellow rainy days where you just want to relax...the title of this CD muight be an indication of relaxation...
4689	MP530 Shines: The MP530 lives up to the Canon name. Fast clear printing, plus color copier and quality scans. The photo printing was as good as our local photo booth can produce. Our use of the Fax machine is limited, and I have yet to try it out. I would highly recommend this "all in one" to anyone with the need for a quality multifunction printer at a great price.
4690	don't waste your money, more importantly, don't waste your time: I am totally disappointed in this movie. It is boring and long. The plot does not have a smooth flow. Colin Farrell appears to not have learned any script for this movie, and the whole bit about him not learning a single Indian word while living with them for months is unbelievable. Pocahontas character is flat in many ways.Just awful movie. I can't believe I'm wasting more time writing about this movie....
4691	Nothing special: I have never been a big believer in psychology, and I find that giftedness is still a rather complex subject. This book will present some interesting hypotheticals to the reader. But, as with most books on giftedness, the focus is on excuses.So, take it with a grain of salt. If you are looking for answers, you won't find them here. I don't think we will ever know exactly what makes gifted people gifted, but thats the fun of it.
4692	Problems with no flow/slow flow: What's the deal with these bottles? Sometimes they've worked, and other times my little girl (3wks old) can't get a drop out of them. I check and double check each time I prepare a bottle to make sure I correctly assemble the bottom "vent" parts. Like Holly, I also called the Playtex customer service number and they said the nipples are not "free flow" nipples so the baby isn't supposed to place her mouth around the entire nipple, only the tip of the nipple. It would have been nice if Playtex would have mentioned this in the instruction booklet. After trying to get my baby to suck off the "tip" of the nipple I'm still having flow problems. I will say that the bottles helped reduce my little girl's gas, however, it's frustrating when I have to stop in the middle of a feeding and transfer the remaining formula to another bottle because of no flow/slow flow problems. I'm going to try Dr. Brown's bottles next.
4693	wait a minute...: I thought that this was a forum for reviewing books not the character of the authors. It has turned into an opportunity to editorialize. Get off of your soap boxes and review the darn book!
4694	One of Best 3 albums by Steve Miller: This simply a great album-this is the 2nd and the first 3 albums are the most non-commercial albums in Steve Miller's catalog--Children of the Future (1st) and Your Saving Grace (3rd) are all you need for the best sixties music with the SF sound and each song shows high emotion--Listen to Dear Mary on this album-especially with your wife or favorite girlfriend-this is simply the best!!!!
4695	Looks great, feels lousy: It looked great when we got it. Unfortunately, we bought it, put it in storage for 2 months and then took it out when we moved into our new home and were completely underwhelmed.I would've sent it back but too much time had passed. The material was flimsy, the sheets lousy. we never bothered to put up the curtains. Its sad, because the colours are perfect for our room.
4696	Food Grinder and Sausage tubes: A must if you have a KitchenAid Mixer ... you can make bread crumbs,nuts, grind your own ground beef and sausage ... I have used this a great deal and extends the use of the mixer. The only thing that I would change or add, would be a larger tray.
4697	Book Beautiful HOWEVER, ABSURB PRICE INCREASE: The price of this book DOUBLED since I placed it in my "cart" last week. Today is 10/2/12. It is an insult to have such an increase in the price. It is simply "price gouging" and greed at it worse. Absolutely an insult. A small increase, okay. but to DOUBLE the price from one week to the next...is offensive.
4698	seems to be an excellent product: A professional knife guy from a renowned kitchen store sharpened our knives months ago and recommended we switch to this instead of the traditional steel that I was using due to the angle this product keeps your knife at while honing. Quality product at a decent price- I've used the classic steel and the Wusthoff brand that is similar but doesn't keep the knife at the 23 degree angle. I noticed an immediate difference after honing a couple of my Wusthoff Classic knives with this thing vice my traditional steel or the Wusthoff brand. This thing honed them faster than the other two and they certainly seemed sharper (although I know this doesn't sharpen). I recommend this to everybody who is looking for a honing instrument that gives great results.
4699	tips: Even though the author is talking about hunting in New York, the tips and information about metal dectecting can be use anywhere. It has given me, a newbe, direction in how to find new places to hunt.
4700	decent for price: I really like in ear head phones and have had many pairs but for some reason these just did not fit in my ears. Not that great of sound quality. Nothing special, you get what you paid for.
4701	100% Garbage!!!: This is one of the WORST CD's I have ever heard. My roommate brought it home yesterday and played it and I wanted to throw the CD player out the window. It's cheezy and lame, like something worse then Clay Aiken. My roommate likes Dave Matthews, Sister Hazel, Counting Crows, John Mayer and so do I, and someone told her she would like Edwin MCain but she thinks he stinks and so do I and now she wants to bring this CD back (...)
4702	Bluetooth Headset Review: For the price, good quality headset. Had issues setting up the bluetooth to work correctly, but that is due to Microsoft's Bluetooth drivers being useless, the widcomm ones not being much better, and waiting to get a key from BlueSoilel for two weeks for $32.99 to get them to do what they should do.I can walk around the same floor of the house, but once I go downstairs the signal breaks up and drops out from the computer. The phone quality is fine too.I like that there is also a cable connection, which means I can put my cellphone and my Sansa mp3 player on my belt and listen to both without any hassles.
4703	Does not live up to the hype...: Spider-man in no way lives up to the reviews and acclaim from fans of the movie. Yeah sure, there are visual effects that left some people...in awe, but they left me saying "how cheesy..." The special effects are no greater than any other new movie, and in fact, without these effects, there really is little plot left to this movie. And when you think about the plot, you realize that there is no substance, no soul to this "blockbuster"...
4704	BADDDDDDD!: After 2 months, the feathers are all over the room! They poke out and stick you while you sleep. What a piece of GARBAGE. But my cats love it.
4705	Good but not great: Honestly I love Daft Punk but they could have done better on this album. Some of the songs are really good but the CD lacks the cohesive nature I felt from "Discovery", which was disappointing. Still I recomend getting it.It's not the best Daft Punk album, but it's still good.
4706	Very dissapointed: I wasted 50 bucks on a game my 7 year old finished in one day. The controls are horrible, the camera is very annoying, the plot is predictable, the enemies are stupid (most get trapped almost immeadiatly), the background jitters and flashes. All in all, by far the worst game I've ever bought for my PS2. If you are considering this game, RENT IT FIRST, you will not buy it later.
4707	ENO LIKED THIS ONE!: I remember reading an interview with Brian Eno way back in the mid-70s where he told the interviewer that "Stranded" was his favorite Roxy Music album.I can easily see why Eno would say this. This is Roxy Music's last overtly bizarre album. "Country Life" and "Siren" would take Roxy into a harder-edged, more commercial universe. "Stranded" revels in its eccentricity. The entire album has a threshold of drones and white noise bubbling under the surface- most notably in "Amazona" which has one of the strangest mixes I've ever heard."Sunset," the final song, has to go down as one of Roxy's most beautiful numbers. The simplicity of the arrangement, featuring acoustic bass and piano, is exquisite.
4708	Not that the facts matter: The timing of this book's release was unfortunate in that the released autopsy makes many of it's claims ridiculous. Schiavo was unfortunately brain damaged and unable to respond to her friends and family. The attempt by the far right in this country to score political points with Terri Schiavo is reprehensible. I assume the facts will be ignored by them, as with so many other things.
4709	Very good!: The price it sells for is a bargain and a really good book. i would recommend this product. I would rate it 5 stars!
4710	Ghastly writing, dull, tedious: There is so much wrong with this book it is hard to know where to begin. The only people who would like this book are those who would like it's anti-American political statements. There is NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT whatsoever, there are too many characters to keep them straight, and the prose is about third-grade level. I didn't care about any of the characters. This book isn't even close to the quality of a Clancy novel. The plotting is so dull, it is difficult to sustain one's attention on the story (you'll find yourself thinking about tomorrow's tasks, today's problems . . . anything but the story). I can't believe I finished the thing. What a waste of time.
4711	Marley & Me: Life and Love with the world's worst dog: Hilarious and so reconisable. A very moving book that all people will like, also the non-dog-lovers.The way John Grogan describes the scenes, one can picture the events lively. Heartwarming, moving book about man's best friend.I loved it!!
4712	Don't be fooled by these reviews like I did...: this is a TERRIBLE discman. Lasted me about a month, then the anti-skip started dying, now after owning it for only a month and a half - it doesn't even play cds. and i can't return it... im out $50
4713	May never know...: We may never know if we like this product as the Amazon box was empty when it arrived. We have had no help from amazon, compusa, nor the maker of this software after numerous emails and phone calls. This was my son's Christmas present and he's still waiting... at this rate we'll end up with the opinion that we shouldn't order software online...
4714	This book is genuine stuff and a thrilling narrative: Philippe Defechereux's book has had an effect on me similar to the madeleine cookie on Marcel Proust, reviving old memories of the colorful efforts of my father, Alec Ulmann, and his pals, to revive road racing in America in the late Forties and early Fifties. I was present at most of the races and knew many of the characters both of which are so rivettingly limned by Philippe. This book is genuine stuff, the smell of burning castor oil coming off the pages, to say nothing of the smoke generated by the behind the scenes political battles! If, like me, you were there, this book will transport you back to those earlier days. If you weren't, well, you missed something grand. You can, however, be heartily grateful to Philippe for bringing it all back to life in this thrilling narrative.Edward F. UlmannSon of Alec Ulmann, Founder of the Sebring Race
4715	Internet Message: I've always hated knowing that the good guys are going to prevail, and that the bad guys always get what's coming. I rooted for the machines in the Terminator movies. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a twist on that old formula when I read Internet Message. Our heroine is not saved, as we suspect she will be. Lilly is the token innocent, virgin, reluctant victim, and we are sure she will transform into reluctant hero. Instead, to my surprise and delight, she transformed into a nasty blood sucking mistress, as powerful in her badness as she was shimmering in her goodness. These characters are fun to read, but what makes Internet Message stay with you is the unique spin Woods puts on it; the nice guy does NOT get the girl, the ultimate heroes are not who we think they will be, and there is no sentimentality sparing the lives and undeaths of our main characters. In vampire transformations, Woods left barely a soldier standing, and it was good, unclean fun.
4716	Best I have ever had...: This is my 4th carafe pot and by far, the best I have ever had. Great coffee and stays hot longer. I highly recommend this pot.
4717	good: i'm surprised this movie didn't have a big theatrical release. the action, while completly implaussible, was very cool. the scenery was very good looking. it has logic holes, but all action movies do.
4718	Dire: Kincaid's distinctive style feels flat in this book. The repetitions and revisitings are laboured and the feeling lingers that one is reading a submission from a freshman creative writing program, rather than a work from a talented writer (as her excellent essays reveal her to be). Too often the chance of achieving real affect is lost in favour of maintain the forced technicality of the writing. The attempt to capture a character who exists predominantly in absence is certainly interesting, but this is an unsuccessful novel and often painfully badly written.
4719	Makes music clearer and better.: I GREATLY recommend this product. When ever I listen to a song, the quality of this music system makes me feel the mood of the song. If you listen to a love song, it makes you realize how loved you are. All because of the quality of this box. It lets me feel and hear things that are impossible to hear on other music systems.
4720	Rio Forge - Don't Buy: I had the Cali and thought that this was a nicer upgrade. What a mistake. Problems from the first day (couldn't delete pre installed material and add new material) that required tech support - and they couldn't resolve it. I returned it and got the Cali which suits my needs. I would have given this a zero if that was an option.
4721	Moving and Inspirational: The stories are very inspiring, the photos are great, and the book itself is well done from the cover on.
4722	Holes are too smal: Got this for an Xmas gift, I did not want to keep it as we have another golf set.I was overuled.The holes are too small for the balls for a young child (just shy of 3).Instead of creating different challenge levels it was different levels of frustration, frommildly annoyed to enraged. Based on the other reviews I'm sure it will bebroken and in the trash soon.The 13th thing of Christmas that is such a pain to me?
4723	Soft but Short: I'm of average height (5'8") but this "tunic" doesn't have enough length. It doesn't reach the top of my legs and the arms are short too. I ended up giving them to my shorter friend. So if you're over 5'5", don't buy. Material is nice though.
4724	A good pc: Recently purchased the above mentioned hp desktop. It has worked fine for me the processor is fast. It's quiet. It's not incredibly well loaded software wise and your going to want to get viral and spamware protection but all around a good bang for the buck.
4725	Steer Clear of This Junk: The Jason Kelly "Neatest Little Guide" franchise of books is sometimes inspired, and sometimes he just "phones it in". This book is an example of Kelly "phoning it in". Even absolute internet beginners will be scratching their heads over why there's a chapter devoted to "How to Buy a Computer". Obviously someone interested in making a website already has a computer. We're talking extreme basics here folks, and unless you've been dwelling in a cave for the last decade, you'll probably view most of this book as common sense. Sporting a 15 dollar price tag just reinforces the fact that everyone should steer clear of this book and buy their favorite CD instead.
4726	EAST BAY HARDCORE!!: this album is one of the greatest afi albums ever from davey havoks screaming vocals to jade pugets excellent guitar and the pounding drums of adam carson with the great bass of hunter its no wonder these guys are going to the top the best song is this celluloid dream but if you like any type of music then youll like this album
4727	jungle book review: The cover was in much worse shape than the person implied. Otherwise the tape was in good condition.
4728	Portman won an Oscar for this hot mess?: I just watched this movie and after seeing Natalie Portman's performance I'm now convinced the Oscars are as political as I always thought them to be.For one thing, there was barely any dialogue in the movie and Portman's lines never consisted of more than two sentences at a time. Even my non movie buff boyfriend commented about it. How do you win an Oscar with zero acting? We know Portman had a double doing all the intricate dancing, so that basically leaves her screaming and crying the rest of the movie.I guess I'm just one of the dumb peasants who didn't get it, but Black Swan is horribly overrated, as was Portman's "acting."
4729	Another 80s Style: Totally Forgettable release.The very fact that the Japanese release had the Makeup cover speaks for itself. Its really another filler Album. Just ask yourself, how much of this material is in the bands later setlist ( as stilted as that list is).I have the Disc, like I usually say, Any KISS is good KISS. But the fun is more in the having the KISS stuff than enjoying the sound. When I do my compilation discs for my own play, there is nothing memorable here. Sad, but true that this is not a KISS album, but it may be a rock album. However, it is such a truism that KISS is in the show, and so very little, basically nothing, is evocative of the shows, even of the ANIMALIZE material ( recorded on Video tape). Another wasted chance for KISS to be *KISS*.
4730	save your money, buy a different program: Frustrating program, frustrating help system. Most features do not work. Worthless for business.
4731	How to ruin a standard: Carly should stay with folk music. Some of the songs on this album are nearly unrecognizable.( I Only Have Eyes For You).The video would remind you of a any high schooler, trying to present a sensuous song. Listen to singers like Peggy Lee, or Lee Wiley,then make a comparable evaluation
4732	Poor Spacing: Unlike most other foldable wooden racks, this one has wider wooden bars leaving smaller spaces inbetween, so you can only get 14 plates in the top layer, and you better hope that your plates aren't too thick.On a positive note, the lower layer for cups is a tad higher than most others I've seen, so you got a little more space there.Quality seems alright, though it's kinda hart to evaluate after a few days.
4733	Jim O'Rourke's ambient collaboration: The band Indicate is a collaboration between Jim O'Rourke and Robert Hampson.Tracklisting:1 Untitled (10:17)2 Untitled (22:51)3 Untitled (15:30)
4734	My Beautiful TV: Wow! 2 weeks after delivery of this TV I am in broadcast heaven. Immediately got HDTV from the cable company and this TV rocks! I upgraded from a 1980's era 22 in. Sony TV so I'm not an electronics freak, but I am completely impressed and don't notice any flaws, although I just want to watch the HDTV channels now (they look better than real life!). The slow-response remote doesn't have much of an impact as I use the remotes from the cable box and the surround sound system. When I need to shift 'aspect' or 'source' the TV's remote hot keys are just fine. I can't really figure out the PIP and split screen functions - the manual doesn't cover them well, but I have enough to keep me occupied right now. I did hook up my computer to it and that works great and easily as well (but I'd rather watch movies and cable with the set).A terrific value, a good looking set and buying from Amazon was a pleasure.
4735	Not worth the money: I was expecting a yoga workout on this DVD and was I disappointed when I received it and found it was just a documentary about Relational Yoga. Additionally, it is very poorly produced, very choppy, and does not include a DVD menu interface -- it just runs from beginning to end. After reading the previous review on this produce I thought it would be a good addition to my home practice. Unfortunately I wasted of my money on this. If you're looking for a "Relational Yoga" workout this isn't the DVD for you.
4736	Stiffen up!: I've read every single Iris Johansen book, and this is definitely the worst! To me it was something like you'd expect from a Harlequin Romance novel. And how many times does she have to use the word "stiffen"? Someone was always stiffening, about to stiffen or had already stiffened! I know Ms Johansen can write - I guess we'll have to wait until the next book.
4737	Used Tax Cut This Year!, Thank you.: Thanks to everyone who posted reviews revealing Turbo Tax's bs. I bought H&R TaxCut. It was great. I suggest anyone reading this to never buy another TurboTax product ever, of course, if you've read any of the 500+ negative reviews I'm sure you've already made that decision.
4738	Big Ladies of Covington Fan: Great BookIt did go in a totally different direction ...but still had the Ladies intertwined and interesting...a real page turner as all the rest of the series!!!Loved it
4739	Not a true Gazetteer: A true Gazetteer list ALL the current and historical places in a state with information about each place. I refer you to the NORTH CAROLINA GAZATEER by Wm. S. Powell. This S. C. Atlas is a miss named map book!! I was VERY disappointed when I received it and sent it right back.
4740	Enjoyable show for toddlers: I first saw some video clips of Baby Genius videos on the free section of my OnDemand. My daughter absolutely loved them and asked for them all the time. So, I purchased three different ones. This video is a little different than the other two I got (San Diego Zoo and Underwater Adventures) because they play classical music in the background. This video has pretty simple songs that go along with each type of baby animal. As an adult, I find the songs a little silly but easy to remember and sing along with. The main point is that my daughter enjoys them quite a bit!
4741	vulgar and crass: I ordered this CD because I heard Super Freak on a commercial and I liked the beat. When I got CD I knew I had made a mistake by just looking at the inside artwork. There was Rick James licking a leg of one of his singers. The lyrics only substantiated the picture and I actually found a perfect place to store my new CD, in the trash with the rest of my trash!!!!!!!!!!
4742	Not Very Firm: I should have read the reviews first. This pillow is not nearly firm enough to do any good at all. There is little point to its wedge shape because both sides compress down to nothing when sat upon. In fact, I can pinch it all the way flat with two fingers. It's not very expensive but neither is it very good.
4743	Not the Demille I expected: I was hoping for another General's Daughter type mystery. I thought for a little while there, that it could be, but I was disappointed. I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books and I do think that he is a great writer, however, I was looking forward to the mystery part, which really did not satisfy me.This is a great book if you are interested in taking a detailed tour of an American Veteran's Vietnam and are a war buff.
4744	Good but not amazing...: Easy to set up and use. They do have a cheap-spring feel and i don't think they're worth the price (I paid around $100 USD) but combined with the CH Products yoke they complete the flying experience really well.Note: The pedals are rather light and don't grip onto carpets (work best on a hardwood floor)...Overall a good product.
4745	Exciting!: This is a great history book, and I had fun reading it because it is so exciting! It brings out what happens under communist rule. It's a really good book!
4746	good all the way around: Ok, there's only 9 episodes but the story and action are very good with just a touch of humor. Sarah Connor is played by the woman who played the queen in the movie 300. Summer Glau (Terminator) is best known from her days in Firefly and Serenity. The Blu-ray quality is is also very good.
4747	UNSAFE: My daughter got this toy for Christmas. She ejoyed it at first, but we soon discovered it is very front heavy. She kept tipping FOrward and hurting herself. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!
4748	The "Empire" equals capitalism?: Brian Walsh and Sylvia Keesmaat would have us believe that the empire of the 1st century is the equivalent of capitalism in the 21'st century. I give them their due as biblical scholars, but neither has a working knowledge of the industrial revolution nor capitalism. There exists in this book too much mindless railing against the "empire" of post modern times. There is no effort to compare and contrast the Roman empire and the democracies of today (as it would not serve their arguments). Certainly there is more truth to the aphorism "a rising tide lifts all boats" than the authors of this book would lead us to believe.
4749	A book really deserves Five Stars: I feel very lucky that I bought this book. It presents the digital logic world to its readers in a very clear, clean and comprehensive way. This is the book I have been seeking.
4750	Curly Hose: Work great as a space saver and much easier to carry around than the heavier hoses.In the heat, water left in the hose will expand and split it, so be sure to turn off the spigot and open the nozzle to take the pressure off the hose. We learned the hard way, but have not had a problem since.
4751	I have a better idea!: I have a much better idea. Go to your local grocery store and buy a pint of ice cream. There you go! And my advice cost you nothing!
4752	Crappy!!!: I received this as a gift from a friend and it doesnt even warm up!!! Looks like an expensive piece of junk to me...It's bulky and I have no clue who to send it to to fix the thing. Grrrrr......
4753	I think it's a pirated copy.: I have/had this sheet music around somewhere, but since I seem to have misplaced it I ordered this back-up copy. So, the thing is, I know what it's SUPPOSED to look like. (It's supposed to look like the one in the thumbnail, but it doesn't.) The bogus cover appears to be a badly done color copy, very underexposed, poor reproduction--Jay seems to be standing in a dim photography darkroom with nothing but the red glow of the film-safe light reflecting off his skin and fiddle. The sheet music pages inside have the feel of inkjet paper with poor ink fill in several areas. Whereas in the original, the violin part was an insert on trifold paper, making it easier to spread out and read, this copy is all on bifold, and partially stapled in. I really doubt if the Mel Bay Company is sanctioning this product. I'd return it except for the fact that it's not a high value item, so it's not worth the trouble. Plus, at least I have a copy, albeit an inferior one, of the music.
4754	Solid Drill: This is a very nice drill and mine works fine, Dewalt factory-reconditioned is every bit as nice as any other brand. Go for it.
4755	Plank Cooking disappointing: I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my husband since plank cooking is a cooking style that we enjoy. We have been disappointed with this book. Each of the recipes that we tried was inedible and some have inconsistencies and inacuuracies in the recipes. I originally decided to purchase the book because I liked the photography and the layout and I can only hope that similar attention to detail will be added to the recipes themselves. We have now relegated this book to a new role as a fire starter.
4756	Double R: Dont buy this album cop dat We are the Streets, da album on a label who aint given a F**K Double R.
4757	If you like blood and pee: When I bought this book I thought it was going to be wildly erotic. I think a lot of amazon book reviews are misleading. But, I guess it's different strokes for different folks. If you think blood,gore, people urinating on each other and people mutilating a priest and an animal and driving an innocent insane is sexy then this book is for you. I would give it minus 10 stars if it was possible.
4758	Simple elegence: I always prefer men's watches as they have more character. This watch reached me in perfect condition and I simply love it! Simple yet beautiful, good quality, trustworthy brand, all at an affordable price.
4759	Color faded in few months.: Color faded in few months. It was a gift to my Aunt and when I saw ger after few months it was shocking to see the watch color is gone and looked so cheap and bad.
4760	Black Dahlia Murdered again: I was looking forward to this film with great expectations. The book was masterfully written by Ellroy , but butchered by the film director making me question if he even read the book.What a hugh dissapointment.
4761	Hallmark Market Price Guide: What a great little book. It makes looking up old ornaments a snap. There is plenty of room to make personal notes about the prices or dates that other ornaments were purhased.
4762	Excellent sunglasses: These are excellent sunglasses. The blue tinged lenses do a very good job of filtering sunlight, while keeping things from becoming too dimmed like "iron" tint lenses do. Further, despite initial qualms about the design, I found it very comfortable to wear. However, one issue with them is that they don't fold over very well, meaning they take up more space and aren't terribly compact. I cannot go as far as to recommend every person buy them, but if you like the style and the manufacturer, you can't go wrong with Bolle's Boa sunglasses.
4763	they're fun: The fun songs on the album are great; the bad ones are the ones the 1st reviewer says are later in their career. Message-y, labored, embarrassing. But when these guys are good, they're a joy. Sort of gay Smothers brothers. Be a good gift for well-meaning but self-conscious straight relatives; or to give a gay kid a feel for the high spirits of that suddenly long-gone period, post-lib but pre-Aids.
4764	Where is the rest of the book??????: I've read ALL of the Griffin novels and normally keep checking with Amazon for new releases. I immediately bought "The Saboteurs" even before it was released. When I received it in the mail, I immediately thought something was wrong. The package was not as bulky as it usually is with Griffin books. When I opened the package I immediately noticed the book was about half the size of a normal Griffin book. That should have been the first clue. I finished the book, and felt that I was robbed of the other half of the book. The story ended aburptly and that made the book a waste of time........Sad.
4765	BEST BOOK ON RAW FOOD: This is one of the best books on Raw food I have ever purchased. If you are a just learning about raw foods Natalia makes the transition easy! Don't let the word DETOX scare you away! It is more than a detox plan it is a plan for life. If you are new to the raw food movement and you are looking for a comprehensive and simple place to start I urge you to buy this book!
4766	This book can be lifesaving!: This is a great book whether the reader is a victim, family member or domestic violence advocate. Diane's writing is clear as she breaks down the "blue wall of silence". Survivors of abusive cops are validated when Diane states, "You are not alone, you are not exaggerating, and you are certainly not crazy." She also has a book for female officers "Crossing the Threshold" which is available through abuseofpower.info
4767	Great adaptation of the book: I'm not sure how much everything makes sense for someone who hasn't read the book, but as someone who did read the book, I thought the writers/director did a great job of choosing which elements to leave in and which to cut out. The visualization of a lot of key moments and places like the capital and the violence in the arena are top-notch. I went into this movie expecting to be a little disappointed by it, but was actually very impressed. I will be watching it again soon.
4768	never worked right: I purchaced 3 of these lights without reading the reviews and wished that i did. I recieved the lights and plugged them in to charge for the 12 hours (red charge light comes on) as suggested by the instructions. I plugged the power cord into the battery and flicked the switch and nothing. I tried to reset the 12v plug into the battery and still nothing. This was with all 3 lights. I plugged them into the car 12v outlets and the lights worked but that was not the purpose i had intended. I tried to charge them using the 12v charging cord and the red charge light didnt come on. I feel that there is a problem with the 12v connection on the batteries. Anyway im in the process of returning them. Not worth the money at any cost.
4769	Fun if you can get your child to play correctly: I bought this for my grand-daughter (4 when bought, 5 now) to play when she comes to visit. I bought it based on the reviews. It is a fun game. The problem came when she didn't want to follow the rules of the game, turns out she is just like her Mom was at that age. It is a cute learning game. I recommend it.
4770	Fallen by Evanescence: The CD was new and in good shape. I received it in a timely manner.Would do business again. Thanks for excellent service.
4771	Japanese History: This was a hard book to get through. Should have read a sample of the book before buying.Did not care for the writing style.
4772	Why Bother?: Most of the information in this book is available online. I bought it because it was required for a college course, then I never even opened it.
4773	HOW ??? HOW ???: How Ron Hubbnard permitted it ? How Travolta, in his hunger for acting in movie after movie ( most of them bad as hell), produced this thing ??!! Can someone please explain it to me ? I think the flaws are totally clearly explained in reviews below. I just had to rate it to try to advertise innocent people to not buy this thing.
4774	Hauntingly Beautiful!: I was really suprised by the quality of this album when I listened to it all the way through. Yeah, I heard the fantastic _Wake Me Up Inside_ and the tender _My Immortal_ many times on the radio. This album has an edge to it. Amy Lee sings as if she is screaming in anguish (as in emotional pain). The guitar parts by Ben Moody are pure Rock and are excellent. This is really an album to sink your teeth into. I can't recommend it enough. 5 stars!
4775	GREAT VALUE FOR THE $: Heats smaller rooms very well. Would not be good if you had small children because it is hot to touch.
4776	A disappointment: I remember the publicity around this fild at its original release. I expected an epic production. It was a disappointment. Viewing once was enough - maybe too much.
4777	Best Song in a Long Time: My Love is Your Love is the best song that Whitney has had in a VERY long time. This song is beautiful. I love the beat and the tune.
4778	Informative: It gave good information to start me off in the right direction. Now I can do my research with the things mentioned in the book in mind.
4779	Lousy, trite, predictable, corny, minor league writing.: This book is a stinko. It is trite, predictable, corny and obviously written by an amateur.What a waste of time and money. I don't beleive that I could give it away. Next time Ms. Rogers has a book published, be sure to not let me know.
4780	Pretty but Useless: I bought this scale based on all the great reviews it was getting. I failed to read the bad ones, and here I am writing one now. At first, I thought I was going nuts because it was showing that I had gained 5 lbs over one weekend. Everyone cheats in their diet- but not to cause a 5lb weight gain, especially when you are active. So I decided to check my weight daily - and again, it was a 2-5lb difference every day. This morning, I decided to get on and off several times and see if there's a difference. I went from losing 2 lbs, to gaining 5 lbs, to losing 4 lbs all in the matter of 5 minutes. The readings aren't accurate from one minute to the next, and I should trust it weekly? I will be finding a way to return this product, becuase it's useless.
4781	Great light meter: An industry standard. This is built well and works great.It's well worth the price-- and when used properly it will allow your photography to jump to the next level.
4782	Useless Rose Recipes: If you're looking for real recipes using roses as the ingredient this book is pert near useless.Yes, there are recipes, that the author has copied verbatim, in "olde world" language that is hard to understand."Take drie rose leaves and keep them close in glasse" and what is a "grosse powder" how much is "twentie graines", or "half a drame"?What the heck is a "Taffety bag"?Very quaint, but can someone translate please?I gave the book a 2 because it is pretty.If you want more than pretty, if you really want to know how to dry roses or cook with rose hips and petals, this book doesn't deliver.
4783	slime: my grandson wanted to start it right away, had to hold him back until he got home before he could practice his experiments
4784	Great Spoon Spatula!: This is yet another superb silicone spatula by KitchenAid. The large handle makes it easy to get a firm grip on it when you are stirring or scooping. The silicone spoon will not melt or fray and it couldn't be easier to clean. Very Highly recommended!
4785	Perfect Scary Movie, and NOT Overrated: To call this movie overrated, as the editorial staff at Amazon has done, is to ignore, or simply miss a quite revolutionary element in this scary monster/haunted house genre tale: The introduction of a female last-one-standing hero. As my literary professor pointed out some 15 years ago, Alien is the first known instance in Western culture -- in stories, tales, song,etc -- wherein a female is the surviving hero. Not to say this fact in itself is enough to recommend the movie. But it is an interesting, revolutionary step, and one that helps in the argument that Ridley Scott is a 'feminist' movie director, as evidenced in Thelma and Louise and GI Jane. The instance of a female surviving hero is now a common element in literature and film, but at the time of it's release in the late 70s, one would have to turn to cartoonish Wonderwoman and Sheena to find a relative comparison.
4786	Good info for Panama: A good source of general information for travel to Panama, or of course for those considering living there. For example, I didn't know that $100 bills are not real welcome there.
4787	Great CD Reissue Of Incredible Debut Album: This CD is a great reissue of an incredible debut album by Chicago (then known as Chicago Transit Authority; the real CTA objected, hence the name change). The album features such classics as "Beginnings", "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?" (both sung by keyboardist Robert Lamm), "Questions 67 & 68" (sung by Peter Cetera), and a cover of the Spencer Davis Group's "I'm A Man" (where Cetera and the late Terry Kath both sing lead), as well as instrumental pieces that were ambitious for their time. This album remains the band's best work.
4788	Surprisingly suspenseful: This isn't your typical Nicholas Sparks love story. It's a mystery that anyone could relate to. I'd call it romance with dark twist.
4789	Best of the Bunch: My Grandfather had Alzheimer's and my Dad has frontal lobe dementia. I have read a number of books on dementia but Death in Slow Motion does the best job of telling it like it is.Just when I thought the book couldn't pack any more punch, the last chapter came along and made me cry like a baby. It is a very powerful book.
4790	Families - do NOT buy this game: I discovered after buying this game that only one account can be created. If you are in a household with a partner and/or children and you all want to play the game, you are forced to use the same log-in account, which basically means you're all playing the same game instead of playing your own games. The worst thing is that they never told anyone this was the case, and the game's user manual says you CAN have more than one account, but they changed their minds. On top of that, you can only install the game three times before it stops working. If you like to reinstall Windows now and then, then Spore will only work three times. It's disgusting behaviour by the publisher, Electronic Arts (EA). I will be taking my copy back for a refund.
4791	Not what I expected: When I saw this package online I was happy to see it, I didn't realize it wasn't going to be a full screen product or have good graphics. I was expecting it to look like a slot machine. I was extremely disappointed, put it back in the box and haven't used it since it was installed. It was not an expensive purchase so I didn't return it but I certainly would not recommend it.
4792	You'll need CliffsNotes to understand it.: This is the kind of artsy film you watched in English class and broke up into small groups and discussed for 2 weeks.The trailer explains more about the story than the movie.
4793	Occupied Paris- To Resist or Not To Resist?: Alan Furst's "The World At Night" is a haunting portrait of Pairs under the Nazi heel and one man's decision to oppose it. Film producer and reluctant soldier Casson loses everything when the Germans invade and appears to be a man with nothing left to lose. When some Parisians insist that now is the time to look out only for one's self, Casson soon learns the truth- that his nation and his people are still worth fighting for. He is soon recruited into the secret war against the Nazis and uses all his tricks and connections in the film world to learn what he can and foil their designs. Like most Furst novels the city of Paris itself is presented as a major character, indeed it reads almost as Casson's slavish mistress, or unrequited love. Furst again emphasizes character over plot and provides a richly deep, thoughtful spy thriller. A little slow at times, "The World At Night" nevertheless maintains the reader's interest throughout.
4794	Something not right here: I'm trying to upgrade my playstation 3 from 30 gb to 150 gb after reading some reviews about some people using it for their playstation 3 and they say it worked fine ... it's not easy for me. I hooked it up using my ps3 hard dive it fits good and I hooked it up to the usb for my ps3 and it says (cannot start the correct hard disk was not found.)how can it be done? maybe I'll buy a copy of my hard drive and have more gb on it.
4795	are you guys on crack?: i work for radio shack (now the source by circut city) i have seen prob. 10 of these systems come in that are less than a year old all with the same problem, everything apears to be working but system puts out absolutely no sound. so if your system works whatever you do don't move it!!! that seams to be the similarity between all customers having this problem. the system is garbage if you want to listen to your sterio for a wile without haveing to treat it like glass spring a couple extra dollars. after all you get what you pay for.
4796	Nominee for Top 10: Nominee for top 10 worst ever. In recent memory I ever so often come across a movie that is soooo bad I think that nothing could possibly be worse. Wrong!Why?Start out with no subtitles so unless you have a natural British dialect of some sort in your repertoire of languages you are out of luck for understanding the most basic sentences. That is called, "Being cheap from the get go."Add long extended scenes where nothing happens or advances the story/plot then you have what's called cheap filler.Add just a couple of cheap blood prosthetics that can be purchased in any Halloween catering discount store in America and you have really low budget.Add editing that jumbles the story beyond sense. For that matter, add a story that makes no sense.Acting? Not even worth discussing.Recommendation: Fast forward through three-fourths and miss nothing. Watch the remaining fourth and miss nothing.
4797	Gilligan's Island with an Edge: RE: RECORDED BOOKS AUDIO VERSION. Among the quirky Key West characters are a reluctant & reflective Mafia Don, his pal "retired" heavy Bert the Shirt, a ditzy gun-moll with a heart of gold, a neurotic Jewish newspaper editor and the Shirt's aging chihuahua, Don Giovanni. They're all artfully blended in a stew of humor and suspense where its hard to tell the white hats from the black. Well worth a read.One question: why am I the first friggin' guy to, whaddayacallit, review, this book, Knowwhaddamean?
4798	DEFINITELY LOW BUDGET/QUALITY: I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE........IT DEFINITELY IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A KEN BURNS DOCUMENTARY. THE QUALITY IS POOR/VOLUMN CONTROL WAS VIRTUALLY NON EXISTANT. FOUND MYSELF TURNING IT UP AND DOWN ALL THROUGH THE DVD. BUSSLER'S UNFORM EVEN LOOKED PHONEY WITH HIS PLAID SHIRT ON UNDER IT.........JUST NOT A QUALITY PRODUCT ......... PERIOD!
4799	Hell No!: There is no other way to put it but HORRIBLE...this CD is absolutely horrible! I have never purchased a less redeeming CD ever.
4800	Not up to JK Rowling's standard: This book was, sadly, quite disappointing. Order of the Phoenix left me with high hopes after having such a spectacular finale. But the mysteries of the Department of Mysteries, the mirror, and other good aspects one would expect to pop up did not. Instead the book was heavily dominated by characters pairing up together as their hormones apparently became more important than the war itself. A lot of the relationships felt cliche and unbelievable... just thrown together. There was good characterization of some characters like Snape, and the final battle was quite intense, but I was sadly let down by this book after seeing how outstandingly wonderful (and far more memorable) books 3-5 had been. It felt like J.K. Rowling handed off the writing in HBP to someone completely different at times.
4801	Luv these socks!: They work wonderfully for working out on slippery services, but hey they even work for just puttin' around the house in your socks (especially when you have little carpet indoors like my house). Besides the non-slip bottom which makes them ideal for working out, as well as running up and down hardwood floor stairs, they're nice and warm too. Must be that organic cotton with the nice tight weave that keeps your feet warm even on cold floor, while still allowing them to breathe.I love mine so much I'm going to buy a couple pairs without the non-slip bottom as well, for wearing inside shoes and such.Oh and just FYI, pay attention to the reviews and comments out here about sizing, and review the sizing chart which should be here or at toesox.com. Basically a woman's size 8 should go with a size Small. (That's me so I can vouch for that size exactly. LOL)
4802	Definitely not an alternative to Nescafe Iced Java: When Nescafe discontinued their Iced Java coffee syrup, I went in search of an alternative. I bought a case of Coffee Time by Autocrat, because they said it was a "sweet coffee flavor." That sounds good, cause I like lots of sugar in my coffee. Well, Coffee Time was very disappointing. Barely any coffee flavor, and basically colored high fructose corn syrup. I bought a case of Eclipse, which their site said was a "more intense coffee flavor," but I defy anyone to tell the difference between the two products. (They're made at the same site, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same product in both containers.) Now I'm stuck with 12 bottles of a product that doesn't taste very good. I have to add chocolate syrup just to add some taste to it. Pretty disappointed, but oh well.
4803	true work of art: Wild Magic is the first book in the Immortals series. Our heroine, Diane, is an orphaned girl with a secret. She learns to trust herself, her magic, and her new friends. Wild Magic is a remarkable book that you won't be able to put down. Full of magic, suspense, action, friendship, and bits of humor, it's a wonderfully rounded tale. Tamora Pierce takes you on a wild and magical ride with characters, settings, and adventures that you will never forget. We journey with Daine as she comes to terms with her magic and herself and learns that, with the proper training, her magic could very well bring back balance to the world.An excellent addition to anyone's bookshelf. It's well written and won't be easy to put down. After you read Wild Magic, go to the bookstore or library to check out the rest of the Immortals series. I know i'm repeating myself, but this is one of the most magical, emotional, and action-packed books i've ever read. It's hard to describe so go read it for yourself!
4804	mg15tsrb oil radiator: I Received the Delonghi oil filled radiator in timley manor, it was reconditioned heater but looked like new and operated as good as new ,very happy with it.
4805	Excellent Toy: I bought this for my 8 year old nephew. Has been a huge hit with hours and hours of play time. His older brother has enjoyed it as well. Play value for price is excellent.
4806	too small in the neck: I ordered this shirt in a medium which is my normal size. The neck on the shirt was much too small for a medium shirt, and it felt like I was being gently choked. So if you really want this shirt, make sure to order it at least a size larger than you would normally.
4807	Responsible adults & pet owners PLEASE look elsewhere: This book is full of cute cartoons in the margins and official sounding terms created by the author. At first glance you may believe you found the perfect partner to help in the training of your pet. After reading the book, I felt like an idiot to have paid for it. Who would believe an "expert" or the publisher would print ideas such as training your pet by spraying it with Binaca. Depressingly the book turned into an "infomercial" for a leash sold by the author. Be prepared for a non-stop sales pitch. Do your dog a lifelong favor look for a different resource. Consider the books by John Ross for a more sensible approach.
4808	Aqua light swim mask-very disappointing!: I bought 2 pair and the light did not work on one pair at all and the light only worked on the other pair initially then stopped working as soon as the mask got wet (and never worked again).Very disappointing because they sounded like a lot of fun.
4809	Read it, then sit, then think about it a few days later: I picked up Disgrace because of its distinction as a Booker Prize winner, and like all winners of that award it is excellent. Coetzee has used a simple story, and a bare minimum of words to compose an extraordinarily thoughtful work. Because it is so subtle (and a very quick read) you're best served by reading straight through, putting it aside, and then revisiting the book a few days later when, as will surely happen, you are unable to put its haunting story out of your mind and you've developed a more pronounced emotional response to its warm notes and tragedies.
4810	Disappointing: I suspect people's enthusiasm for this movie is due to the real footage of the McCarthy hearings, footage that we don't see often enough and reminds us how careful we should be not to go down that route again. (McCarthy enjoyed huge support at some point, after all.) For people like me who had already seen the footage in the PBS documentary on Ed Murrow ("The Edward R. Murrow Collection", DVD, 2005), the movie fell absolutely flat. There is no original story line, no character development. I guess its redeeming feature was to push PBS to package the documentary, since it came out at about the same time. My advice to anyone considering buying the "Good Night, and Good Luck" DVD would be to buy "The Edward R. Murrow Collection" instead.
4811	OK. Wish it could turn off.: Received this item from Amazon this week. I like the look and feel of the little timer but I can't figure out how to turn it off. I don't think it turns off...it just sits in my drawer while the battery drains. They should add a little on/off switch...even my son's freebie Happy Meal games have an off switch.
4812	Nice: This is beautiful garment. The smell alone is worth the price. The fit is very tight so the zippered waist is a welcome innovation. I usually order a large but the XXL is snug on me.
4813	Buy new don't patch: Remembering patching bike tubes back in the 50's & 60's, thought it was the quick fix for my hand truck tube that had a slow leak for years. 1) hard to remove tube, 2) patch kit about $3, 3) tube still leaked after fix, 4) bought new tube, 5) again hard to remove, 6) new tube no leak, 7) hallelujah, hand truck standing-by at the ready waiting for next job.
4814	Don't waste your time watching this!: The writing in this movie is horrible! The action sequences are good - not great though. I love HK action movies but don't waste your time watching this as there are much better movies out there. If you insist on watching it, I suggest fast forwarding through and just watching the action sequences.
4815	A Wonderful Tour DVD: Just want to congratulate Brian on the very special new DVD, with so many great moments. The love and respect of his music by so many fellow artists, along with his fans, and family, is truly wonderful, truly moving, and absolutely life-affirming. As David Leaf says, it is an example of an artist re-claiming his legacy. And with this documentary, it is the re-validation of one of the greatest musical geniuses of our - or any - lifetime. Two words for Brian - LOVE YOU!
4816	Harmonica Must-Have: If you enjoy harmonica music, this one is an absolute must-buy! Mickey Raphael has played back-up for amost very great blues and country artist, and this is your only chance to hear the man himself. His selections are an excellent mix of unknowns with the very familiar. The music is great for travel, since it will not upset the passengers, while you are soaking up the great sounds. I put this album in the same category as "John Sebatian Plays Bach" and "The Fabulous Thunderbirds" for sheer harmonica listening pleasure.
4817	Great TV when it works: I got my TV in Feb. 2002. My screen went black in April 2002 with a blinking red light on the front, I had the warranty and they replaced the power supply and cord, or so the tech told me and they had the TV for 2 weeks. Works fine again. Jan. 2003, picture is extremely grainy, the tech comes out and takes my tv and replaces one of the boards on the tv works fine again, tv gone for 2 weeks again. October 2006 warranty if up, and I have a convergence problem, the touch focus does not work, and I can't manually move the red convergence, $450 for repairs, tv gone 3 weeks. Jan, 2007, screen goes black, blinking red light. Time for a new tv. I think I'll get an old reliable CRT TV. The Toshiba had a great picture when it worked, but not worth all of the problems. My advise would be b4 you buy, pick which one you want and search through forums to see what problems others may be having.
4818	not good for the price: this says it will glow but it does NOT GLOW. so for the price it is not worth it.Would not recomend
4819	Very Unhappy with Watch: I have been sailing for some time now and received the watch as a long awaited sailing gift.It is a little big, but I got over that very quickly. I had the watch for about 9 months and was preparing for an ocean voyage. I was looking forward to the compass feature. Two days before the voyage the compass went crazy and has not worked since.The really annoying thing about the watch is the necessity to look "directly" into the face. If you look at an angle, you might see any array of numbers imaginable, fives are sixes or eighths, and ones become eleven. The date 9-15 becomes 8-16. It is really maddening.I admit I haven't been back to the manufacture yet, but these problems should not occur to begin with.Be advised.
4820	One of 2010's Best films: Get this movie!! If you like Quentin Tarantino, you'll love this incredible ride of a film. Cage is nothing less than brilliant.
4821	Ruined my glasses: I purchased this product hoping to repair my scratched lenses. Unfortunately, after waiting a week and a half for it to arrive, I was surprised to find how ineffective it was. The coating looked more like clear nail polish and did not fill in the scratches at all. When I tried to remove the coating using their own cleaner and cloth, I was shocked to find that it actually ruined my lenses even more! I tried a second time, only to have the same poor results. Finally I gave up, bought new lenses, and in my frustration with the return policy, threw the entire kit away. Terrible.
4822	Good solid info & great recipies: I have re-read this book several times. It has excellent information on nutrition & health as well as very good recipies to utilize the 14 foods. It is a wonderful reference.
4823	Good sampler, but translation is tough: It's a good sampler. The translation is a bit tough though. Also see Bauerschmidt's Holy Teaching, which is another annotated abridgment of the Summa, but with a smoother translation and covering more theological ground.
4824	Cognitive therapy-don't believe the hype: I actually have been to Robert Leahy's center-the American Center for Cognitive Therapy- a let me tell you that it was the biggest waste of money in my life. Arrogant, simplistic therapist who wouldn't even let you talk. CBT is a breezy, pie in the sky treatment not up to snuff to the challenges of an even unperturbed existence. [...]
4825	Got Milk?: This book was about a girl named Janie. One day at school while she was eating lunch she saw a picture of a little girl on the back of a milk carton that had been missing. She had a strange feeling that the girl was her when she was young. She had no idea how it could be her, but she decided to do some research on it anyway. She got shocking results. Was the little girl actually her? I liked this book because you never knew what was going to happen next, and the characters seemed so real I felt like I knew them. This would be a good book for teens, but other ages too.
4826	Excellent purchase: Overall, I feel I made a good purchase for a great price. Picture clarity is great, nice to have the dvd player right there. Great TV for the price and size.
4827	Jamei and Angus: My daughter loves Jamie and Angus. She likes the drawings in the book as well as the cute stories. Her favorite is the one where Jamie and Angus have to go to the hospital for Jamie's stomach ache. While he is there he takes a little girl and her stuffed animal's last three chocolates that she was saving for when she got to go home. My daughter learned that it was wrong to steal from that story and every time I read it to her she tells me that Jamie and Angus are being bad. They are a tad long for bed time stories but I think the extra time is well worth a quality story.
4828	boring for the first 1/2: This book was very boring for the 1st 1/2(almost 300 pages) because they gave you information without any backround info. until the last 1/2. Then he gave you backround info. and it got better, but this book wasn't very suspenful, action-packed, or scary. I gave Richard Bachman a try and I will never read another book from him. I am sure that if they make this book into a movie, I will NOT see it.
4829	This is the worst movie ever ( - infinity stars): All copies of this movie must be recalled, put on a rocket, and fired into the sun.
4830	Fractured crystals: I love this book because I have quilted two quilts on the longarm quilter and they are beautiful. I highly recomend this book
4831	Great Jars, bad seller: Bormioli Fido Jars are great, however this reseller is mismarketing their product and acording to the other reviews im not the only one. I assumed after 2 bad reveiwes they would correct thier product, however they still have not. What I received from this company were 3 8 ounce flasks. Very nice, but not what I was looking for. The return through amazon was simple and smooth as always.
4832	A nihilistic film that flirts with substance: This film attempts to address big questions of origin and creation, there are moments when it approaches meaning but ultimately this film takes you on a ride only to leave you at a dead end street.It is a nihilistic film.
4833	not what i expected: The picture showed a pillow that seemed to be wide enough to rest both legs easilyNOT! it was not as comfortable as the one they gave for my cat scan. cheap and speedy delivery though. gathering dust right now.
4834	framing nailers: Lite weight framing nailer. Really like the single shot switch. Good for toe nailing without the double shot other nailers sometimes do. Been a carpenter for many years, found it hard to give up my hammer. Don't mind not using it as often now. Milwaukee took all the bugs out of framing nailers. Well worth waiting for.
4835	First time user..: I bought this pressure cooker because a friend of mine owned one and was always using it to cut down the cooking time of some tougher cuts of meat.I have used it 4 times since my July purchase and I am very happy. I have made a batch of split pea soup with ham hocks and it was done in 45 mins. The meat was falling off the bone, just the way I like it. I am still learning to get the correct timing with other cuts of meat but altogether I am satisfied.
4836	A cut and paste of eagle manual: A big portion of this book is literally a cut and paste version of eagle manual and screen snapshots. If you have slightly ECE and chemistry background, you will find this is an almost useless book. I give it one star because this book collected some useful URLs. However, you can always find those links through online search engines. Don't waste your money on it.In addition, the preface of this book contains some inappropriete politics story that ruins a technical title.
4837	Dropped connection continually: Bought this and the matching pcmcia card for my laptop. Setup was very easy, and it worked just fine right out of the box.But, in one weekend's worth of usage, I had horrible troubles with dropped connection. According to the Dlink strength indicator, I had the full 108mbps throughput, and I was only about 20ft away from the router. I returned it.This is the second time that I have had this type of troubles with a Dlink router/pcmcia card combo. No more dlink wireless for me.My configuration that has been working for quite a while now is a dlink 614+ wireless 802.11b router (which does work fine) and a cheap Gigafast 80211b card.
4838	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS!: Ahem. As stated above, don't but it. Even though it hasn't come out yet, it is provived that this tape is crap. How do I know? Simple, all off Cardcaptors is crap, and second we've seen it on TV. (OoOoOh, look at the shiny red button on my VCR labeled REC!) Please just go buy the original, Cardcaptor Sakura. Thank you. *bows and runs off*
4839	Silly: Bad pop. One half decent track and too many with no soul. No complexity, no blood, no love, no magic. Paper thin pop junk. Very disappointing for the discriminating listener.
4840	Good show: OOOh WEEEh !! This is a good show it is the first time that I have seen the show I was not born when it originally aired. I liked the show almost instantly. My favorite characters are Junior and the Postman. It is not like the content you see on tv these days. You can actually watch this show with out all the cursing, soft porn, etc. This is a good show I wish it would have lasted longer.
4841	Eye-Opening Garden Writing: We are so disconnected from the natural world, we can't see the damage we are (maybe) permanently doing to our own backyards and other common areas. Sara Stein examines our disconnected state, and proposes some ways to reconnect and salvage our place in the natural world. This book is a breath of hope- read it and restore your own Eden!
4842	MISSION GALACTICA: UNIVERSAL ATTACKS: Im very disappointed. This is actually a butchered verson of THE LIVING LEGEND, a two-parter, with a few unseen special effects from the series. The problem here is they cut off the ending of the two-parter, and replaced it with the finale of THE FIRE IN SPACE, another Galactica episode that came later in the series. Having seen LIVING LEGEND in its entirety on TV, I can say they sacrificed drama for spectacle by deleting or shortening several key sequences of character interaction. The end of the tape is an abomination, a mess of bad editing and confusing dialogue that makes no sense, having been a paste of the endings of two different stories. LETS HOPE UNIVERSAL RELEASES "THE LIVING LEGEND" INTACT!!!
4843	Wish: I could totally relate to parts of this book. Made me laugh the whole way through. Not one boring part. Read it!
4844	Great Deal: Used these for my massive frozen storage after the growing season. Have sealed well and performed great from a freshness perspective. Very economical and incredibly good bags.
4845	Don't waste your money!!: While the original DVD extended edition gave you the option of seeing the original classic movie the blu ray does not. The additional footage adds absolutily nothing to the movie and changes it from a wonderful comedy to a movie that becomes bogged down in scenes that should have remained on the cutting room floor. SONY/Columbia Pictures should be ashamed for not releasing the original classic movie first on blu ray or at least having the original as a part of the extended blu ray disk. While I give the original moive five out of five stars this extended edition in my opinion barely holds on to two out of five stars.
4846	Worst HP I've Ever Used: Does NOT do manual duplexing like it says. The drivers just don't work under Vista, and you will waste 1/2 a ream of paper trying to get it to work before giving up (with the latest drivers). The paper feeding is junk and jams/misaligns paper all the time because the alignment guides are only a couple inches. It is noisy. Even new, it has terrible squeaking and groaning sounds. In comparison, I have an 11-year old HP 4000 duplexer which never misses a beat, runs like a well-oiled machine, and has jammed maybe 2 or 3 times in it's entire life. You can guess which printer gets used most. HP has gone down the tubes creating junk printers like this.
4847	Autographed copy missing autograph!: Although this item was advertised and priced as a collectible, the first copy had no signature because the page that was supposedly signed was torn out of the book. When I notified the seller, they agreed to send another with a signature. However, when the second copy arrived, it was signed, but not by the author. Instead, it was signed with a woman's name who seems to have no connection to the book at all. During the last communication I had with the seller, she agreed to locate and send out the autographed copy. Still nothing, so I expect we will not be receiving what we paid for.
4848	No guts no glory!: Anyway... couldn't wait for it so I got one from a local book store! man its a classic!
4849	The floor lamp with poor design and cheap materials: when I received this lamp, the package was already broken. The product was built with very cheap material and the power switch was very hard to turn. There was no screws for the torch part. I regretted that I bought this product.
4850	Broken, WARNING to all!: Do not buy this toy. The front hood will break when you put it into robot mode or back into car mode. This is why the Bumblebee toy is so hard to find.STAY AWAY and keep your money!
4851	Strike Two!!: At least Uwe/Ewe/Oo-Eee did'nt use Romanian hookers in this one. Why make this film? The plot is silly (Billy the Kid?? Reallyy?? There was a film called Billy the Kid versus Dracula, maybe that's where this idea came from?), the fight scenes are terrible and the acting is truly horrible.The game is fun, skip this mess and play the game instead.
4852	Save your Marriage the Fun Way!: This series actually helped save our marriage. It is especially useful for marriages where one or both are Aspergers.
4853	very small tab: The music in the book is not very appealing and the tab is so small you need binoculars to read it.
4854	Stopped working in less than a year of minimal use: We bought one of these on a road trip and used it for maybe 20 hours at most in the car. We even took it out of the car when we left to keep it from getting too hot. Once we got home it was used only occasionally as a DVD player for our bedroom TV. It was not moved or exposed to less than ideal conditions (as it would have been in a car). It really was treated like a baby, but it just stopped working after only 10 months. Warranty in the US is only 90 days so it's a total loss. I would recommend trying another brand.
4855	GREAT BOOK!: This is a really good story with nice illustrations! My four-year-old son loves the story and I enjoy being able to tell him the meaning behind it; that sometimes being different is a good thing.
4856	Useless: I am a rookie agent and found the material worthless, a complete waste of money and time. There is no real technique here. The book so repetitive its agonizing. The worst part is it really has nothing to do with real estate, I learned NOTHING about the real estate business reading this book. You could re title the book an infinite number of times and have the same content "The Millionaire Day Care Worker" for example. There is as much information about running a day care as there is real estate. Steer clear.
4857	A disturbing book: The earlier reader reviews (of the paperback and hardcover editions) are quite accurate about the content and tone of this book. It is very lively and easy to read. Fine presents a thorough survey of the various devices that that the subconscious uses to keep us on an even keel in an unsettling world. But those devices are devious and deceptive, and reading about them is deeply unsettling for the picture it gives of how completely at the mercy of this deviousness we are. We end up feeling that nothing is at it seems, that nothing is quite what we believed it to be, not our thoughts, not our idea of ourselves. I have read many books, both fiction and nonfiction, over the years, but I cannot remember one that so materially changed my outlook on myself and on other people. Read it at the risk of your own peace of mind!
4858	And now the leftovers: Having purchased this primarily for the "Nightime" side, ( as with it's predecessor) This follow-up compilation doesn't come close, which is the rule for most "#2's". The Deuter piece at the end of disc 2 is the standout, but that's worth the price in my (pocket)book. The "Daytime" disc is pleasant wallpaper music not nothing distinctive nor distinguished. Good for dentists waiting rooms I suppose.
4859	needed an editor badly!: This book provided some information on configuring and implementing Active Directory but overall was pretty poorly written and seems to not have passed by an editors eyes at all. Many of included diagrams added nothing to the discussion - others were mislabelled or otherwise didn't match what the text was saying. So, to sum up, this appears to be a hastily published effort to get out before or when Win2k released. I'm still looking for the right book - currently reading Windows 2000 Active Directory by Alistair Lowe-Norris
4860	Avoid like your life depended on it: I don't actually own this film (Thank GOD!!) I did rent it however, and it stinks! Rudy Ray Moore is past his Dolemite prime in this one. The action part of it is slow and there is no recapturing the glory days. My suggestion is to stick to the orginal and not this cheap imitation to reap money from the Dolemite name.
4861	Cheated: I have ordered these chews several times. Three out of the last 4 bags were duds. 50% of the chews in the bag were the diameter of toothpicks. I will not waste my money ordering them again. Two stars because my dog actually loves the chews that she can have. The rest are garbage.
4862	This cushion IS NOT THE MEASURMENTS STATED!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!: So sad that manufacturers now days have to fib about there product to make a sale. It seems to be about that almighty dollar rather than just selling an honestly described product. It is so frustrating to check and then double check and check again to make sure it is the correct one and find out the manufacture is NOT HONEST in the description in the first place. The cushion is a great deal with the one exception. IT IS NOT THE STATED MEASUREMENTS AND WILL NOT FIT. The manufacturer states the product dimensions as: 14 x 8.8 x 2.8 inches. THE TRUE MEASUREMENTS ARE 11.75 x 7 x 1 inches. It is not even close people and it can't be stretched that far. The worst part is, Amazon paired this product with the exercise bike I purchased at the same time. I paid $19.50 for it and now they raised the price to $25.00 I suppose they have to make up for all the returns somehow.
4863	I Have One in Each First Aid Kit: Excellent over a dressing for controlling bleeding since it provides its own compression. Also excellent for compression over strains or sprains.Make sure you get the 3M Coban. The cheaper types are not as secure, and leave a (temporary) waffle pattern on your skin when removed.The three-inch are better, but can get a little pricey if you buy more than a few.
4864	Buchanan is right.: I have come to the conclusion that Buchanan is right.Very right.Ultra right!!GET IT (YUK! YUK! YUK!)?
4865	Read this book WITH your kids: The title of this book introduces it as "the inside scoop on 50 art masterpieces". Rather than gaining an inside scoop, I found myself introduced to art which I was unfamiliar with, as well as a reintroduction to many pieces I had seen before. The writing style is clearly geared for adolescents / middle school students. As one who has not had much exposure to art I did find this book an enjoyable, easy read. I think the book could best be used to introduce school age kids (or middle schoool kids) to the world of art. When my children get old enough, I plan to read this book with them.
4866	Works Great: Installed this on my (circa 2002) Dell Dimension 4100. Easy install. Everything works fine, including the included Firewire cable.
4867	IS NOT WORTH THE HYPE: THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT REALLY. ONLY IF YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC AND FAIRY DUST WILL THIS PRODUCT WORK. DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID AND BUY IT BECAUSE IT GONNA BE YOU NEXT WRITTING THIS MESSAGE.
4868	Buy this bag!: This bag is perfect for car camping! It holds everything for our camp kitchen. Its huge! We bought this to go with our Coleman camp stove and we are very happy with it. We have our propane tanks, coleman speckled dinnerware set, camp pots and pans, and there's still lots of room left. We really like that it keeps everything in one place, so you just grab it and go! But it is quite heavy when loaded because the stove goes on the bottom part. So make sure you are in good shape, or have your husband carry it(like I do) So I wouldnt recommend for hiking. Great bag!
4869	Folkmanis Puppet Ragdoll Cat: The hand only goes into the head and I can barely get my hand in. It looks cuter in the picture. I plan to return it.
4870	pampers fell apart: I was very dissapointed in the quality of the last batch of pampers that I bought. 1/4 of the diapers fell apart as I was putting them on my daughter. I switched to Huggies because of this and have not bought any more pampers.
4871	Nice & Sturdy: This rake was very sturdy and good quality. My daughter loved it and started pretending to rake right away. I love that it is a real tool scaled down to her level instead of a plastic toy.
4872	Good: It was in fairly good condition. The description was pretty accurate. It didn't take very long at all for me to receive the product. Reasonable price. Good buy.
4873	waste of paper & ink: Glad I only paid a penny for this book. Most any one could figure this out without a book to tell us... nothing.Maybe a Mediterranean Cook Book would have been better? ...no, wait... I already looked those over. Seemed like a bit of useless info to me.
4874	Poor Quality: I received this item as a gift, but didn't try to use it until the next summer. When I put it into the freezer I noticed blue leaking down the sides of the bowl. When I contacted Kitchenaid they offered me a discount to re-purchase the same attachment at a higher price than available at Amazon. Since I wasn't even able to use the original attachment once, I'm not wasting my money on getting the same thing again and will choose a different brand. Do not recommend (or at the very least try it right away so that you can get your money back while it is under warranty)!
4875	Enough already!: I'm the biggest PF fan I know. Maybe I can purchase and watch this DVD before I attend "The Great Gig In The Sky". Until then I guess my only choice is to keep borrowing my friends VHS! C'mon guys,give us a break!
4876	Slippery: This mat is extra cushion-y and forgiving on the knees but it was very slippery. Doing downward dog was an exercise in futility as my feet and hands would just steadily slide out of position. I ended up buying a mat from Lulu Lemon. It was expensive but is an excellent, cushion-y, no slip mat. This mat just sits in the corner now, lookin' sad.
4877	Blatant misinformation: I admit to not having read this book, but the blantantly mis-statement that "Many software projects fail because their leaders don't know how to estimate, schedule, or measure them accurately" means that I have no intention of ever doing so.
4878	author is chatty: The clear scripture would be helpful if the author would focus more upon that. It seems he strays, and avoids staying with scripture for revealation/meaning. This changes the book into a story more about him (author) than God. It is his experiences about God with his own personal filter absorbing most of the text. I hoped for a book fully about God, revealing the richness of His vast nature/character. I hope the author makes more room for God in his personal life than he does in this book.
4879	stop all the crying: I can't stand listening to this guy crying in every song. Whatever it is that has made him so sad, he needs to get over it and sing like he has testicles. I can't wait for this band to come to my city so I can punch the singer in his face and break his jaw so that it has to be wired shut.
4880	I did not received the item, 1 week overdue: This is the second time I had trouble with a book order... I wish i had gone a different route.
4881	Saved me much time: If you are already experienced EJB developer then you will appreciate the good wisdom and advice in this book. I found it is not a problem solving kind of book but a problem avoiding one. Read before you start your next project and like me you will save many hours of frustration.I give 4 stars because some chapters are not as useful and overall the book could have better organization. But these are small points. Definitely you should read this book!
4882	CASIO EXILIM EX-Z30 -- Poor Customer Service: After using the camera for 4 months the battery quit charging. Working with the camera store where it was purchased we determined that the problem was with the camera rather than with either the battery or charger. I returned the camera to Casio for repair. In response I got a repair estimate for $215. (Cassio's flat repair charge is $190 + shipping & handling + sales tax -- for a camera that cost $230.)The customer service rep told me that the 12 month warranty was not valid because the camera had suffered an "impact." After a couple of weeks I finally was able to speak with a manager who told me the case had a "bad dent" in it -- although the camera wasn't dented when I sent it to Casio for repair. The manager finally agreed to have the camera repaired as a "courtesy." When the "repaired" camera was returned to me the battery still wouldn't charge.Although I liked the camera while it worked, I definitely would not buy another Casio product.
4883	Simply superb!: This is a wonderful compilation of works performed by 2 well gifted artists. I really hate to have it reach the end of the final track every time we play it.
4884	an awesome fry pan: well what can I say this is a great fry pan my cousin came it and used it now she has 2 of them and may get another. yes she caters and says it performs great.
4885	Casting was excellant: Great movie, brough me back to those problem years. Reminded me of times I have lived thru. Cast was good. I couldn't wait until the next evening to see the next show. Scenery was beautiful. Just loved it.
4886	Excellent first novel: I recently read the novel afetr it was recommended to me by the clerk at Walden's. The novel was exciting and well worth the sleepless nights up reading it. The ending was a little preditable and he could have explained a few things better but I guess that comes from being a screenwriter. I cant wait to get his next novel for I am always searching for new material to read
4887	sweet: When buying this I did not realize that the head moves to the music... when played. I would recommend this product.
4888	clarion u let me down: ive had a clarion eq in every system ive had i started to build a new system so when it was time to get the eq i said i cant go wrong with a clarion found it it was a great price so i got the eq746 i was happy when i got it for the first time i have to say this thing is junk so i asked around and alot of people said these things r like a xbox360 some of this style eather work great or junk from the start i really hope the next one i get will b one of the good ones plus when i got it the fuse was blown and i jus took it out of the box i should have known i was going to have problems its a shame i really like clarion eqs thay never let me down till now
4889	As the lady before me wrote: "AWFUL" , "AWFUL"!!!!!!!!!: My father-in-law purchased this DVD player for my daughter for her fourth birthday. It was the biggest mistake he could have made. Not only is it a piece of junk, but for a child to try and figure out what the controller buttons are used for is utterly impossible. They have these strange pictures that a child nor an adult could figure out. And lord help you if you loose the child controller, because then you are left to rummage through all of the garbage on the larger controller. This item is now sitting broken in the closet of my daughters bedroom because when she went to open the slot to put her DVD in, it broke off and the DVD slider came out and stopped halfway and that was it, it is now completely shot in less than a year. Do yourself a favor, don't buy it. We purchased this when the cost was up there at $99.00, they should offer them free because they are worth less than that.
4890	a great time for horror fans!: "Dead Snow" is really creative, totally over the top, and lots of fun for fans of the horror/comedy genre! (And don't be bothered by the fact that it's subtitled - I can't believe that some people are still bothered by that.) Made by people who love the genre and clearly had a blast making it, this is terrific entertainment with beautiful scenery (pristine white snow makes the bright red blood and gore really stand out), a strong cast, and excellent effects and production values. Only a few odd moments hold it back from absolute greatness, but you just can't quibble when you have a movie that's this much fun. Highly recommended!
4891	kind of disappointed....damaged product: One of the 5 markers was damaged...box was damaged... the Sharpie Marker itself, too large to do Calligraphy with...the ink bleeds out and ruins the words...
4892	Cheap Product: The black nubs on the end of this product fell off the second I took it out of the package, and it is very poor quality overall. I already need to buy another one and I have only been using it with my dog for a month.
4893	Main character rather repellant: After buying/watching two episodes, I felt I'd rather not throw good money after bad. There seemed to be no connection to the main character, and while that may have been by design (because of the work she does as a call girl, she's not the kind of person to let people in emotionally), it wasn't a show I wanted to watch further.
4894	Not worth the money!: My five year old daughter picked out this toy with her Grandmother. The commerical had her hooked! We got it home and soon found out it was not all it was cracked up to be. We could never get the horse to buck. We tried all three levels and still could not get the thing to move. The most frustrating part is the "hooks" on the saddle are not long enough so a majority of the parts will not stay on the hooks. I don't know if our game was broken and it should move with only a couple pieces on it, but it definately is NOT worth the money.
4895	very good: This book is very comprehensive and is used for the AP Biology course taught in high school. Great reference book as well as included CD.The book was in good shape, but not brand new.Shipping hard bound books in a bag does not keep the corners of the book from being damaged. I suggest future shipments be sent in boxes.
4896	Could have been great = Slams Christian values: The movie had a great premise. I thought it would be on the lines of "Sister Act". A clean comedy with joyful music. It was until someone had to interject profanity into the movie for some strange reason. THEN we had choir members sleeping with each other - yeah - that was funny and so very Christian like. It was so sad to see beautiful voices wasted. And Dolly - what were you thinking??So - turned it off (after we paid to rent it) and read a book.....
4897	Go with the Sony brand: I thought it would be a good idea to save a few bucks and buy the aftermarket batteries. I was wrong. I bought two of these and though they function well, they do not hold as much charge as the Sony battery that came with my camcorder. I would not buy these again and would instead pay the premium price for the Sony brand batteries. When I pull out the camcorder to shoot video after a few weeks of being in the bag, I expect it to work. That does not happen when I used these batteries.
4898	It's a size 4, too small for my 26 months old baby: My baby is almost 26 months old. Grow rate in weight is 50%.Not a fat but a healthy weight one. The 2t to 3T diaper is little bit tight on waist, and thight.Compare to a size 4 huggie diaper, this 2T-3Tpull up is smaller.It is a great deal for thin 2 years old baby but not for grow rate at 75% kid.Hope this review that help.
4899	Worst dishwasher detergent ever used: This dish powder gets stuck in all corners of my dishwasher. It does not dissolve well, leaves a crust, thin layer behind. Cleaning power is so so. I cannot wait for my pack of 12 or 16 whatever I got from Amazon to get over.Also if for some reason, dishwasher cup does not open, but the dishwasher runs anyway, the whole powder after getting moist becomes like a rock. Very difficult to clean after that.
4900	Excellent quality but limited scope: Like most Falcon hiking guides, this one provides useful and reliable information. The only shortcoming is it doesn't provide comprehensive information on all the trails and destinations. It wouldn't take much to add this info so that a reader who wanted to cobble together a different hike from the ones described in detail could figure out distances and altitudes gained (similar, for example, to AMC guides for hiking in various locales out East).
4901	Wonderful Music!: This CD contains some of the most wonderful music ever written. I love Fancy Free and Candide, and the recordings here are just as they should be, lots of "punch"!
4902	for teachers, not students: The author deals more with the philosophy of fighting and how to teach it than the practical knowledge that i was looking for. There are just a few pictures which made it very difficult to understand when he would describe a technique. Also, too many "war stories" its not what i wanted in the book.
4903	Dirty connectors, does not work: Game came very quick which was nice. The problem was when I tried to play it. The game didn't work. I had to clean the connector pins to get it to even show up. I will try to clean them some more and get the game to work properly.
4904	Would rather give it a ZERO rating: Extremely unimpressed with Mr. Moss and Mr. Moss' book. Nearly a full 75% of the book is about this snot nosed kid who does nothing but whine about his life, his mother, his girlfriend, etc. He goes on about his own intelligence ad nauseum. It was getting to the point where if he mentioned his odd fascination with true crime books one more time I was going to have to scream.Perhaps if he had had this ghost written, by someone who knew what they were doing, he could have produced a much better book. As it stands, the book is for the most part boring. I also believe that he embellished some parts of the book. If you look at his picture and then read the supposed tale of his encounter with Mr. Gacy you'll understand what I'm saying.I have never in my life, until this book, ever thrown one away. This book went straight into the trash- where it belongs.Save your money, pass this one by in a hurry.
4905	A Classic WWII Movie: This movie is the best one out there to tell the story of Midway. Using real footage from the attack when possible, and some real footage that doesn't match in others and really bugs me, this movie is great overall and I recommend it to anyone.
4906	Loud: Seams like it should work, and add Horse Power! It didn't do anything but add lots of noise for me. I couldn't tell any difference in power. It did rattle everything on my truck as it is very loud. Returned to Amazon without issue. Amazon rocks!
4907	Interesting topic but unfocused book: Am I the only one who didn't love this book? After reading about Shackleton's adventures in the book "Endurance", I longed to read more about antarctic exploration. However, "The Worst Journey in the World" fell far short of my expectations. The first half was too long and not written well enough to sustain my interest. The author kept going off on tangents that made it hard for me to focus on this book. The story picks up in the second half, but I was sorely disappointed. Check out "Endurance" for a better read.
4908	Worked but not in some areas: It is difficulty for me star this product without being bias. First, the coconut oil did not work on the tip of my hair. I focus mostly on the tip of my hair because it is dry, and the rest of my hair are soft and feels great! I have come to a couple of conclusions of why the tip of my hair is the same: I may need a trim, lack of nutrient overall, or it is the weather. And secondly, I gave the product another star because the shipping was on time. :D
4909	A good study tool: We are using this book in a group setting but is probably just as good a tool for use by oneself. It is very informative. Used with a Bible, checking on Old Testament and New Testament related scripture, a wonderful picture comes through and you can relate to Mark's story!
4910	Ooo!: You have to watch it to know what is going on. I am not one to spoil a movie so you will just have to watch and see.
4911	oh dear: a tip for the film industry when following up on a successful film or films try to remember what happened in previous films. george lucas ignores all that facts from empire eg ben was trained by yod,the force is a living energy field.
4912	Good thriller: This is a really good psychological thriller. I was surprised that there was not any gore, which I don't care for anyway. There were lapses in the action, but this just left time to wonder what would happen next. The actors were very believable, and the chemistry between the two main actors was intriguing. The main character's secret was a good back story; however, some of the villains' motivations were not very well explained. It had a very American feel though, with the underdog fighting back and ultimately winning at the end of the movie. It was not a scary movie, but a mess-with-your-mind movie. Very nice!
4913	An amazing product!: I got hooked on Bisto while in the UK wwaaayyy back in the 70's on a short visit - I can honestly say I NEVER make beef pot pie, shephard's pie ( NOT the traditional recipe ) and pasties without my Bisto. I also use it for roasts and chicken dishes. There is not anything in the US like this product and I hope I never have to do without it!I can not and do not use the powder Bisto but the granules are the way to go!
4914	What remastering?: The digital video transfer and 5.1 DTS surround sound they said would be included in this DVD was a complete lie. The sound is just as horrible as it was in the original DVD, as you hear "pops" for gun shots and explosions. And the video is just as grainy and dark. It's truly a shame that such a great movie can be tainted with such a horrible DVD. If you have the original DVD, I wouldn't waste your money or get your hopes up on this DVD.
4915	granite gold: Was a bit reluctant to purchace something other than the hope product to maintain our granite countertops....should have purchaced the hopes....this does not clean...plus leaves a film...
4916	FANTASTIC!!: i would constantly get ingrown hairs and bumps on my neck after shaving... NOT ANYMORE!After using this i rarely see any bumps ... great product. will continue to buy.
4917	Oster beaters: Only one beater fit. Very slight difference in length but enough to where it would not lock in place. Beaters not sold for specific model.
4918	Not what you might think it is:): I enjoyed the entire story. The actor's were fantastic in their roles. The story was powerful and very true to life. I can see why a lot of people might not enjoy. It is difficult to look at our defects and be willing to take action.
4919	The product is good, however, the service was TERRIBLE.: The product is good, what I needed, good quality. The service, however was just awful. The site promised the shipment within 24 hours. I waited for it for at least 3 weeks. I could have found similar item at a store or on a different site!
4920	Mine was DOA: Right out of the box the watch periodically stopped when wound. Usually when the second hand crossed the minute hand in certain positions. The hands appeared to get stuck - possibly contacting each other - you could move the watch and it would start running again. It would not keep time.
4921	An expose with a heart: While the author may, at times, err on the side of blaming Christian Science (rather than fanatical parents themselves) for the neadless deaths of Christian Science children, this book is still worth reading. Frazer not only provides a complete history of the Christian Science Church, she also exposes the special legal privilages which continue to allow church members to provide bogus "healing" , often at taxpayer expense, while getting away with murder when this "healing" proves fatal. Fraser is also willing to take her research a step further than most would dare, linking Christian Science practice to many current New Age healing fads, and warning that these fads, too, could someday prove fatal to unprotected minors. A worthwhile, if depressing, read.
4922	Informative and easy to understand: I baked my first major wedding cake this year, and this booked helped me feel calm and confident throughout. She does not deal with fondant at all in the book, so it's not a resource if you plan on making fondant-covered cakes, but the buttercream cakes it's great. She explains everything in easy to understand language, and addresses pretty much all of the questions I had.My only complaint is that the book gives instructions in the context of her recipes, so if you're using a recipe of your own, there is a bit of adapting you may need to do to follow her instructions correctly.
4923	Good for awhile: I was looking for a way to store bath products within easy reach.We didn't want to make holes in our new tub surround so I thought this would be perfect.It mounts securely and does hold a lot of items.However you never know when the suction is going to release!Several times we were awoken by a loud crash as this basket and contents hit the bathtub.So I have mixed feeling about it - it is good while it holds!
4924	Love her, where has she been all these years: I think she is great. This CD is great and the DVD is better. You can hear her passion in the CD but the DVD lets you see it as well. Would love to see her in person. I am going to put it on my bucket list.
4925	I give it less than ONE STAR.: The only thing I saved from my purchase of this DVD was the case. It is one of the slowest paced movies I have seen, and I remember what families did before TV. If I was in a theater I'd have asked for my money back. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope I hadn't wasted my money. This is a great way of learning how not to write dialogue. This movie is B A D and I mean "bad"!pjKeller
4926	very good: I bought my door handle from amazon cause there were not very many choices for suppliers and i have dealt with amazon before. the price was good and the product was right. I only had one con for this handle, the discripion was not quite right but i knew the part number was right and it turned out good. i would recommend this to my friends.
4927	You can live with it, but....: The most troublesome thing about this TV is the black line and white shading that appears at the top of the monitor whenever there is a dark screen--horror movies, transitions between channels--anytime you watch a dark scene! Sure, in high-def with a bright colorful screen, this TV looks fantastic, but just wait. I've had mine six months, and I sincerely regret spending $700 for it, when I could've gotten the Sony for just a couple hundred more. It's making me insane! Do not purchase this TV if you obsess about the little details like I do!
4928	Mustache Lollipop Candy Mold: This mold was very cheap and exactly what we were looking for! It can be re-used, and it works great! I would order more than one if you don't have about 10 minutes per tray of 4 lollipops to spare to make a bigger batch. Otherwise, the single tray works fine!
4929	My Choice for the Worst Book Ever Written: I'm a woman who is so sentimental I cry at supermarket openings, but everything written in every bad review of this book is true. It is an abomination. "Doonesbury" had a send-up of this book years ago, which was wonderful. As the woman next door said, "I wish I'd seen "Doonesbury" first and saved myself the time."
4930	The most AWESOME movie!!: I finally bought napoleon dynamite cuz it is a movie I had seen but wanted to be able to watch it without wasting time with tv commercials. So many funny jokes and napoleon says some of the funniest lines. The trailers for NP did not really get my attention and when it finally did I was happy I took the time. The characters are very retro its like a flash back. You can watch this movie over and it doesn't get old.
4931	Not good for cloth diapers: I purchased this pail for cloth diaper storage, but I found out after two days of usage that it is not good for it because this pail can hold only 4-5 wet cloth diapers, which not even one day's worth of diaper supply. I think it would hardly hold one day worth of disposable diaper supply for disposable diaper user, which is only good if you want to dispose diapers everyday. Overall, I think this diaper pail is too small and only good as a secondary pail to use somewhere else in the house other than nursery.
4932	Rieview for the iPAQ h6315: The HP portion of the PDA works fine and is supported by an excellent HP service. But when it comes to the phone part, it becomes a night mare. T-Mobile US is one of the worst service providers. When calling customer care you get routed in a circle and after several call you come back to the first service agent you remember by name, but he does not remember anything.I strongly recommend to abstain from buying the specific product. The "marriage" between HP and T-Mobile should be long divorced. A bad taste remains on HP-products as normally they realy care for their customers.Something T-Moible still needs to learn.
4933	CHEAP TOOL....: I have brought several link removers from this seller and have been very disappointed. All this pins have broke. This is the worst one yet! My husband collects watches and loves tool gagets. Next time, I will buy a quality tool and will pay a little more for a better made link remover.
4934	Better than Rainbow Six: Now that Jack Ryan has been President for a while, it's hard for Clancy to produce really great stories where we admire Ryan for playing the valiant underdog. Nevertheless, Ryan's role in Clancy's latest book is thankfully more prominent than in Rainbow Six and the result is a great story. I found the plot more believable and engaging than eco-terrorists. In any event, Clancy is still better than anybody else out there.
4935	pants are wrongly sized and returns are poorly refunded: So I ordered these in hopes of getting some good around the house sweat pants, theyre sized closer to 2 sizes smaller then on the label when compared to unbranded or hanes products of the same size.So being an amazon prime customer I was easily able to return them, but they charged half the price of a pair of the pants as a "restock" fee, I dont know if they do this for every order returned or just me, because I had to remove the pants from the plastic bag to try them on.Needless to say I will not attempt to get a larger size of these pants from them since if they dont fit right I will be eating most of the cost in return fees.
4936	Not happy: I bought a 5-pack of Sony DVD-R discs at Walgreens for $2.00. They aren't worth $0.20. All five returned unrecoverable errors while trying to burn a system repair disc. Window 7 diagnostics said the media wasn't writable. I've read comments on a couple of PC forums regarding the same issue with Sony DVD-R discs.
4937	Great...Addictive Series Never Shown: This is a great addictive series which was cancelled early in NBC's schedule in 2006. Great writing and acting make this a must see- one of the best I've seen. If you liked Damages on FX you'll love this more.
4938	Pet Tabs Supplement For Dogs: I purchased this item for my mother. She was thrilled to find the supplement at such a great price.Thanks!
4939	This is good - could be a classic: This album is like a hybrid of "I say I say I say" and the "Erasure" album. However, it's much more accessible than the "Erasure" album and lacks obvious single material such as in "I say". Overall, a very "warm" yet "moody" album that is bound to be a classic - perhaps the most consistent album since Chorus. The fun Erasure is gone, and this is the melancholy Erausre, but it's really good. Buy this now.
4940	I is nothing like the original Bourne series.: I bought the movie for my husband and I did not watch it myself. He said that if he hadn't previously read the book, he would not have understood the movie at all.
4941	EJD does it again!: A wild ride of interesting relationships! CHEATERS=ROLLERCOASTER, jump aboard, and hang on!
4942	Pretty Good - but dryly written, almost like a diary: As other reviews stated, the book is very thorough and gives extremely good insight to the early stones. It especially describes the many contributions of Brian Jones which are not usually talked about or even known by many. The early history is quite fascinating. Although I do recommend the book I have a few problems with the book that greatly dimish its reading pleasure 1) It only covers from 1963 to 1969 (so we don't know what happened in the 70s and 80s) 2) Wyman constantly discusses the woman he has "had", this gets old pretty quickly 3) It is at times very dry reading, often it is just a bunch of facts listed in chronological order from his diary But overall this book is chuck-full of information that only an insider would know and can describe. This is really the basis that I recommend the book. I did read it quickly (in a few sittings) which is very rare for me.
4943	Be prepared to be in Awe: This is not a popcorn and soda DVD, this is an awesome opportunity to observe through the eyes of scientists the majesty and beauty of our privileged planet. Sit back and enjoy the fantastic images of the earth and the surrounding universe. Any doubting Thomas' will have to ask themselves why it is that the earth is in the best position to sustain life? Was it coincidence or was it design?
4944	Very Good, But A Little Annoying: Although this is an excelent book, with a good plot and belivable charachters, I almost put the book down when I saw the description on the back. I mean come on! Lenomy Sniket made me feel that people that like happy endings wouldn't like this book. I am one of those poeple, but I LOVED it! A must read for Harry Potter fans, and everyone else.
4945	sounds the same: I have all of Carlos' albums. I'd have to say I was probably expecting too much out of this one. Most of the songs sound too similar to past songs. I guess at a first try I was a bit bored. I do like Como tu and the fact that there is still some valleanto and rock. Interesting enough the play on words, rock de mi pueblo. Just an odd cultural observation!Anyway, the cd did not sound as fresh to me as I hoped, but maybe that will just grow...?
4946	well done: I thought that this video was filmed well and had a pretty good story line about the issue of jealousy.
4947	Best Resource Around: This is hands down the best book to guide parents. I can't tell you how many times it has helped us as we learn how to care for a newborn/baby. Organization is intuitive and advice is clear and concise. Everything you need to know is in the book.
4948	Not a very good movie!: I bought this movie with really high expectations, but I was very very disappointed! It is very rare that I feel like turning a movie off, but this was one of those cases. As a history major and somebody who is interested in early American history, I like just about every historical movie that I have recently seen(even Patriot, which was very sappy). Not this one. Patriot was a better movie and even Last of the Mohicans gives a better idea of the forces that pushed America to revolution. You can do better than this:)
4949	Devastatingly funny portrait of marriages gone wrong.: Connolly is a major comic talent of a certain vintage: British, Thatcher-bred and entirely without hope for the future. His characters are comic masterpieces of self-sabotague. Connolly, while well-respected and even downright trendy in Britain, awaits mass-market discovery in North America. Connolly takes place alongside Tibor Fischer, Martin Amis, Will Self and Irvine Welsh as the best of the comic glooms: unlike these other authors, Connolly plumbs the entirely realistic to produce surreal humour. A gem!
4950	Very Good Product: I have used this product for several years and have been extremely happy with the results. It really does lift the face over time and make you look ten years younger. However I am not happy with this seller because they are asking twenty one dollars more than if I bought it from the company direct.
4951	Susan Isaacs She is NOT!: I bought this book because the author was touted as being the next Susan Isaacs. In your dreams! Susan Isaacs is witty, literate, and her books are fast-paced and original. Jane Heller is dull, plodding, predictable, and banal. This was a struggle to get through. An awful piece of dreck.
4952	WHAT OTHERS KNOW, YOU HAVE TO READ: What you should know about L.C. Hayden's, WHAT OTHERS KNOW, is that this is a book to read in one sitting, turning each page with anticipation.Dan Springer lost his wife and his daughter--the former to murder and the latter to abduction--six years before the first page. For six years, Dan has been looking for his daughter, Diana.In this riveting book, Dan continues to seek out his daughter as a new clue comes to light. The book is all about Dan and his renewed hope that he will find Diana.The setting is Las Vegas. The detective is Harry Bronson. This is Harry's third adventure in this series.The kidnapping of a baby is the nightmare of every parent but in L.C. Hayden's extremely capable hands, the characters are engaging and the story fascinating, leading to this reviewer giving WHAT OTHERS KNOW five stars. It would be six stars but I couldn't find a way to add another star!
4953	Great movie.: This is a great and heartfelt movie. Love the cast. With Morgan Freeman you can hardly go wrong.Good Sunday afternoon flick.
4954	And this passes for talent?: OK, while I'm in a good mood, I'll make this polite: Jack White can't hold a tune in a bucket, neither can Meg. A five-year-old could drum better than Meg White. This duo should be mown down with a truck for slaughtering a Bacharach/David classic.This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. I'm sticking with The Band until things improve... God help us all.
4955	Very well researched; in great depth and feeling; EXCELLENT: I chose to not have children at age 18 - and I've never regretted it. Now in my thirties, I've spent countless hours reviewing and explaining my choice, often for people who had no right to know but insisted anyway. But here, for the first time ever, all the arguments and thoughts I've had about choosing childnessless are discussed in depth and wonderfully in this book. Ms. Lisle wrote the book I would have written if I could have done so. She has my eternal respect and gratitude for putting in print what I've been trying for years to explain.
4956	Excellent mystery full of intrigue and complex themes: I found the book to be a real attention getter--just couldn't put it down. The plot is masterfully constructed to keep the reader's attention throughout. This is the author's first book. I'm certainly looking forward to more works from him. He's a master story-teller!
4957	Everyone should read this book: Just like the title says. I know a couple of Catholics that I'd asked to read this, and they wondered if it were to be taken 'tongue-in-cheek'. No, it's a serious, enlightening book that is easy to comprehend. If you don't believe in God, no worries, it's a way to understand, a different view, and a life-altering tome ( for myself, anyway). Learn to Love.
4958	Too noisy for us: We ordered this to make sure our cats stayed hydrated, They weren't particularly interested in it, but I don't blame the product for that. Our cat are weird. What was a problem was a noisy pump. It was somewhere between a hum and a low buzz, louder than most aquariums I've been around. Too much for 24 hour operation. It's also unnecessarily complex with quite a few parts, and though I didn't use it long enough to have to clean it, it looked like a chore. Removing and cleaning the pump regularly was recommended in the manual. Our waterer gets cleaned every couple days, and it only takes a couple minutes.
4959	Good Buy: These are the best earbuds I've ever used (so far). Good bass response, and they fit well too.
4960	Works great: Flat out, this works. It doesn't clog like a traditional brush. The long handle will be a bonus if/when cleaning a grill with live coals.
4961	Better than expected !!!: This CD rock !!! I wasn't a big fan of "enema of the state" because for me the songs were almost all the same and something was missing ... But with "Take off ..." Blink did a great job !!! The songs are really cool, catchy and melodics, just listen to "Anthem Pt 2", "Rock show", "Reckless Abandon" or "shut up" and you'll see what I mean. At the end, a very good CD from a band that I'm starting to love more and more ....Old fans won't be disapointed and blink might have some new fans with this record !!! Thumbs UP !!!
4962	Close to Useless (mirror good, mount bad): This is a nice-looking mirror with a mounting system that just doesn't work. I tried mounting it on my wife's Trek mountain bike using both of the supplied sleeves as well as various improvised alternatives but never succeeded in getting it to remain on the bike for more than a day. As others have indicated, the mounting system is fundamentally flawed. I finally gave up and did what I should have done in the first place: I bought the superb Mountain Mirrcyle mirror. If you want a mirror that stays on the bike, the Mirrcycle is the way to go.
4963	not worth your time: I read the entire anthology. "Passport" and "Something Like . . . Love" were good stories. Not great, but good. Every other story in the anthology, though, was awful. Some would have been disappointing from a middle schooler; in the cases of authors whose other stories or novels I had read, I found those in this anthology poor examples of their writing; in the cases of authors whose other work I had not read, this book was no motivation. Also: you at Amazon have listed the book's reading level as "Ages 9 to 12." Are you sure you don't mean "Grades 9 to 12"?
4964	Look for a star, and others: I saw a film called Circus of Horrors when I was a lad--a weird, sadistic Pygmalion-based fantasy about a mad plastic surgeon--but what I remembered most was the dreamy, haunting (if silly) song, Look for a Star, which kept playing through the soundtrack. Now, 40 years and some later, I find it on this album (which also tells me there were 3 other versions. Lucky I got the right one!) Well, not only is the song just as I remembered it, but there are many other deep, Proustian treats here. Also revealing to me is how good Nancy Wilson was, and also how moving Sukiyaki was (in stereo, they say, for the first time). Regarded as a novelty number back in the naive, ethnocentric 60s, it is a beautifully sung pop song, the emotions quite affecting, even for those of us (including me) who can't understand a word. If this album is an indication of how good the rest of the series is, I'll be getting more.
4965	Fun Bardot Western: This was one of Bardot's last films, shot in the early 70's.She is full of life and throws her energy and spirit into thislightweight film. Claudia Cardinale is also in high spirits. Both have a charisma that carries the film, though the supporting cast give uneven performances. Bardot has a mature beauty in the film, with riveting eyes. The plot revolves around an Outlaw (Bardot)hiding out in a town, pretending to be a Doctor. Later, both women find out that there is oil on a property and fight over the land. The film is poorly dubbed, but much of the humor still translates into English. Bardot made two more films in '73, and then walked away from the silver screen forever. Most actresses hang on to their fame long after it has passed them by. Bardot is a class act, and used the rest of her life to help animal rights causes. She had a flair for comedy, and Frenchy King is a fun western.
4966	Right Touch: Monique Haas recorded work by many different composers but she owned French impressionism. Her solo-piano recordings for Erato may be the best evidence of this artistry, but the preludes featured here on Disc 1 also stand out because of how well Haas was able to convey Debussy's submerged lyricism. The preludes show off her lovely sense of timing. Disc 2 is headlined by Ravel's two piano concertos, and both are worth repeat visits. What you may find stunning, though, is how successfully Haas was able to integrate both a Bartok concerto and Bartok's Sonatine into her musical universe. Compare her performance of either piece with the version recorded by, say, Zoltan Kocsis. It's hard to recognize that they're by the same composer, so thoroughly has Haas made them her own. Even if you own other performances of everything in this two-disc set, therefore, the package still wouldn't be redundant.
4967	I Don't Understand What He Trying To Say........: I have to read it for my High School, and write a report about it. Even though I read it 3 times but I still don't understand what is he trying to tell me and what is he talking about. I just feel it is so FAKE....well it is Fiction after all.
4968	Dead Man's Walk: Superb quality DVD.I love Amazon.com......I can find just about any movie I'm looking for when I can't find it anywhere else even TCM.The prices are the best too, cheaper even than Walmart. I've order quite a few movies now from Amazon.....cudos to you all for the best selections and prices. I will be a loyal customer forever. I can't praise you enough!!!! Truly a 5 star company!!!!
4969	Not worth buying: Unfortunately, the only songs I can stand to listen to on this cd are the ones that were already released (so yesterday and why not). The rest are pure drivel and completely maddening. They make me want to smash my poor, innocent cd player. Save your money - buy a good book!
4970	A love letter to informing: Elia Kazan named names to the HUAC in 1952 and in two years he came out with this love letter to informing. He informed on Zero Mostel (and others) in order to keep his job and to make sure that Zero was forced out of Hollywood for two decades.I don't care how good this film. Kazan was scum.
4971	HOLLY SAMPSON: Viewers may not be aware that Holly has appeared in some hard core productions such as "A Slave to Fashion" where goes by the name of Nicholete.
4972	amethyst earrings: My wife loved these.I bought them for her last Christmas and she's stillwearing them regularly.
4973	womderful actors & actresses: I have been looking for this dvd for quite a while. I love Phyllis hyman in this play. She was great what a natural. I'm looking for any other plays Phyllis. Hyman has starred in. The disc was in perfect condition. Great quality! Great service !!!
4974	Good Movies: The collection is good as far as the quality of the movies are concerned. The lack of special features is really the only drawback on this set.
4975	Works after you get used to it: I needed something to support my belly so I could sleep. I got this pillow and it took a little getting used to. However, after I got used to it, it works pretty well. I wish I could say more but I am close to the end of my pregnancy and I am not sure if I can really get comfy with any pillow right now. But I would recommend this pillow, love Boppy products.
4976	All LED lights should disclose color temperature: I was very disappointed to find that the color temperature on this product is quite high, despite the fact that no where on it's profile is the color temperature listed. All LED manufacturers should be required to supply the color temperature info along with any order of their lights. The light works great, it's just not what I wanted. For anybody's reference I would put the color temperature at around 3500-4000k, it is not something you want to use indoors (or really outdoors for that matter, it's a really white temperature).
4977	Never got it to fit my needs: I am fairly tech savy, but this one threw me for a loop. I consider this monitor user UNfriendly. I never was able to get to the point where I could monitor my heart rate for more than just a few minutes. I think my monitor was probably defective...it was hard to tell because it seemed much more complicated than it needed to be.I have great praise for Amazon because of the ease of returning this item...a truly great company with excellent customer service.
4978	Fargo: I would recommend Fargo to anyone whow has a sense of humor. This dark comedy is for an intellectual who sees the underlying humor in a film about kidnapping and murder. William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, adn Steve Buscemi are excellent in this film. If you haven't seen it rent it or better yet buy it and watch it over and over again.
4979	For the brain dead yuppie in your life....: OK, in ten years, Creatu and company have gone from interesting enthic bending dance/trance to numbing workout muzak with frigteningly big brother-esque overtones (Push The Limits). Not that self help muzak doesn't have it's place in the universe, but let's not give it massive airplay (judging by sales, it's not getting it!). It's fine for the stair-stepper, but once you get off, what's really here that you can't find in your average elevator? Buy a dance music disc to workout, or some Brian Eno to chill, but skip this waste of plastic.
4980	quintessential Hartmann bag: I think this bag has been in Hartmann catalog forever. I think it's a better illustration of what a nice Hartmann bag can be when working with nylon and leather together. I know Hartmann leather is nice but weight can be of issue. It's got two compartments with plenty of pockets and such. It uses heavy nylons that doesn't encourage bowing out when packed to the fullest. Nice and aesthetic design with good functionality. I'd improve the shoulder strap to have a bit more elastic to make it more comfy. I'd also include a suiter, and wider tie down straps. Finally, I'd make the side where your body touches the bag (when shoulder carrying) to be a bit more stiff. It could also be a little longer to be perhaps about 13.5 inches.
4981	Maybe one of Brooks' earliest, but it's very funny: When I saw this movie I realized Mel Brooks is more of a comic genius then I thought. My favorite guy is probably Taggart next to William J. Lepetomane. Slim Pickens & Mel Brooks played their roles perfect. You'll love the dialogue so go and rent it you'll like it.
4982	I made a mistake: I made a mistake if this was listed as "used", because that's how it came. I think that beauty products should never be sold as used. It's just not sanitary! I was not very happy.
4983	Calculus: Don' t pick this one, so terriable. I had ordered the book almost one month ago, but I got nothing besides waste my time and money!!!!! Be careful!
4984	Horrible and embarassing!: Where do i start?? This movie is an embarassment to black people! This was stupid and not funny.What got me was at the end of the movie,the actors tried to get serious and started to act in a drama type way when kevin harts girlfriend child got tooken away.I was in disbelief!!! After a hour in a half of brain dead comedy it twisted at the end and fell flat.
4985	New Tool: It's amazing how this tool replaced a screew driver. What will the EPA think of next. Homelite probably got some kind of reward for this.
4986	bright: its true.. the light is very bright but not very much. the blue is beautiful. it was easy setup. i sleep peacefully with it still. the only thing i dont like about it is that it doesnt get 101.9 (one o 2 jamz)
4987	barska deep 7x50: I am really disappointed. When I removed the binoculars I was very impressed with the design and heft. The directions were useless and in calling customer service I received a similar useless set of directions. The battery insertion was impossible to figure out and the compass and light never worked. I am sending them back (pain). I like to try another Barska model but I am really reluctant after this experience.
4988	A big disappointment: I didn't find the fashions in this book very cool at all. Most were unflattering, the clothes were shapeless, and not very attractive. Too many large, loose, baggy clothes. The clothes all looked at least one or two sizes too big for most of the models. Many women over 50 keep themselves in great shape and don't need to camoflauge their figures. One older woman was shown in huge, tent-like clothes throughout the book. Some of the "dressy" outfits were matronly looking and not dressy at all. Definitely not cool! Not worth the money.
4989	BandIT Works Great!: Received the product from the vendor in a timely manner. Probably the best forearm brace I've tried and I've tried several model and brands.
4990	Outlanders DVD or VHS???: I own both VHS. DUB. and DVD. HYB. The DUB. format on VHS. is worth 4-5 stars. DVD is worth only 0 stars. Wen they put it on DVD they butchered the script!!! They took a wonderful story destroyed it!!! If you want DUB. forget buying the DVD, Buy the VHS. format!!! I find my self watching it on VHS. instead of DVD, because the story is that much better.
4991	Great product: This product if for my 7 year old daughter and she is playing on it every day. A great value and a quality product.
4992	They Blew It Hard With This One: This album has MUCH to be desired. There are only three good songs worth anything on this album. The rest is just scream-o/thrash junk. I really don't know what they were thinking here, or what they were trying to pull off. Tracks 1, 3, and 4 are all that make this album worth spending one red cent on.Abe's drumming is just as brilliant as ever, the only hi-lte to the album. These guys seriously must have written this album in one week. Only a hardcore devoted Deftones fan could fall in love with what has been laid down here. Frankly I'd rather dust off their old albums. B-Sides and Rareties was much better a release.I listened to this album 8 times over, each time was a disappoint(however 'hole in the earth' is beautiful single). If they could just grow up and stick to the emotive/passionate songs and throw away the macho trash they really could be a great band.
4993	A very good read, but wait for the paperback, if you can.: A good long read. A little jumpy, expecially if you read a little each day. One of those stories told from a multiple of persectives where you always want to get back to the other and then when you do you want to get back to the other. Very hard to put down, many a long night and longer days waiting to continue. Sherkaner (spider) and his family were well characterized. I had no problem imagining Anachna (the spider world) and its on/off star (200 years of darkness and cold/50 years of light and warmth). You have the two human sides The Qeng Ho (good) and the Emergents (evil). All in all a great cast of characters vividly portrayed in a suspensful page turning story.
4994	Good look into the 50s: If I were a woman suffering from this problem with no name, I would have gone mad. This book is such a good look into the lives of women in the 50s. I would highly recommend this book and have. Arrived in good condition and in time.
4995	boring predictable crap: I have one question. Can you play from the point of view of a german soldier? No you say? Then what in hell is the goddamn point??? If i can't be a mean, grizzled, ss seargant, or a tough fallschirmjager, blasting away at tom hanks looking g.i.'s with an mp-40 in both hands, then i don't want to be anything at all.peace.
4996	lemon cookie delight: If you have ever enjoyed a good wheat flour lemon cookie and are gluten free, this is the cookie for you. We keep this cookie on hand to have when we need that little special treat.
4997	La base para cargar es pésima: Tengo este mouse hace más de un año. La base para cargarlo es pésima, hay que hacer equilibrio para lograr cargarlo.
4998	worthless commons: out of a hundred cards only one was worth keeping, the delivery was quick and thats the only reason am not rating this product 1star.just spend your money buying singles rather than getting a dozen random cards that have no collection value and no efficiency.
4999	Midnight Movie Madness: Though not for all tastes, the uncut version of this 1974 softcore spoof certainly has its moments. However, the restored footage is not an improvement - resulting in a draggy midsection. The sophomoric hijinks worked better in the original R-rated version. Highlighted by some surprisingly good special effects (even Buster Crabbe was impressed), "Flesh Gordon" remains more palatable than the majority of low-budget midnight movies. If a theatrical revival comes your way, see it with a late-night audience.
5000	The Series that started it all...: Being the "mature reader" that everyone said I was, my grandmother gave me The Hobbit for Christmas, and my mother urged me to read it. I was only in second grade at the time, and finishing up the Narnia series; I didn't read it until that summer...and then discovered all I'd been missing.After devouring The Hobbit, my mom got out her tattered old copies of the three Lord of the Rings books for me. I went insane...LotR is, as anyone who's read the books knows, even better than the Hobbit. Now, nearly five years later, I still continue to read and reread of the heroic, enchanting, and epic tale of Frodo (a kind-hearted Hobbit burdened with an evil, mind-possing Ring of Magic)and the Company on their quest to cast the Ring into the Cracks of Doom...therefore destroying it and saving the Middle Earth from destruction.
5001	Fun While It Lasted: The Omron HJ-720ITC was more money than I wanted to spend for a pedometer, but the PC link software inspired me to go ahead and give it a try. The idea of monitoring your results on your computer daily seemed liked a good one, and to its credit, the software is fine. The unit itself, however, is typical junk. It worked fine till the first battery change then, the device that detects movement, i.e., counts your steps, just quit working. The display is just happily telling you as you walk for miles, that you are remaining completely motionless.Save your money. Just walk for a specified time everyday and the money you save will buy you a lot of smoothies.
5002	Crime and punishment: I am sure this book is quite good.Just found it pretty hard to get into.Hav'nt finished yet.Hope the book gets better
5003	not working item: recieved item was not working.had to contect the seller.was adviced to send item back.still waiting for refund(over a month now).would not recommend this item.
5004	DVD Horror Classics: Some of the 50's Drive-in type movies are terrible, but well worth the price for the classics
5005	Use the Right Chocolate: I have two fountains and they both work well now that I know what I'm doing. I used to use chocolate chips, but I couldn't get the mix right and I either put too much or too little oil. The oil does effect the taste slightly and it just looks gross pouring it all in. We had lots of troubles when we used the oil.We then found SF Signature Fountain Chocolate, which is for sale here on Amazon or it is also available at Target stores. I went to their website also which is www.sweetfountains.com. It works great and the fountain flowed perfectly. No oil needed and simple. The quality and taste were excellent.If you are buying a fountain, I highly recommend you buy fountain chocolate.
5006	Not enough stick-to-it-iveness: If you like having birds feed right at your window, the Dine-Around is great...for as long as the two suction cups stay suctioned. A full feeder and two bluejays or starlings trying to get at the seed will bring it crashing to the ground. If you could insure only chickadees hear about the food, you'll love it.
5007	Lasted 10 minutes: My 6 month old, 31 lb, Lab mix puppy destroyed this toy in less than 10 minutes. She chewed right through one of the "arms" and pulled so hard the others started to break apart. If you have a dog with very sharp teeth and strong jaws, who is a power chewer, don't get this product. It is not nearly indestructible, as advertised. It's a shame because she really loves it. If the company can make one that is really tough, I'd buy it.
5008	Please Select INSTEAD the Better Music & Arts Transfer!: Warning: Sirio Records employs HEAVY Cedar computer processing in a specious attempt to sanitize old recordings, and thereby removes not only high frequency noise and clicks, but also ambience, air, and instrumental timbre!Sometimes the results are absolutely execrable, and the sound is mushy and intolerably dull. There is a preferable alternative release, made on Music & Arts, of these broadcasts, in genuine MONO sound, with some surface noise, but with all the original contents of the recordings intact, including the highs and ambience.Piano music fanciers should note that Ania Dorfmann's traversal of the Choral Fantasy solo part is spotty and clumsy, with blurred passages. However, Toscanini, and orchestra, and chorus, are all quite thrilling.
5009	A Real Sleeper (Yawner): This has to be the worst of Grisham. By "sleeper" I mean you will probably fall asleep many times before you get through this one. I started it this past summer and finally finished it in the fall. The book starts out great, but drags along after several chapters. All the slow detals on the gas chamber and the people on death row. Don't waste your time, try The Testament instead.
5010	Casio Men's Waveceptor Solar Watch: Up until this moment the watch has functioned as it is supposed to. I received it from Amazon in excellent condition. The watch is very accurate and I do not have big problems reading the screen. I am satisfied with my purchase. By the way, Amazon has a great price, the watch is at $150 in the Casio's website while Amazon sells it for $97. It is a great buy.
5011	WOOOOOOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!!!: B-Rocka is back in full force...NO FILLERS YAWL...Best tracks are: "WHo is she to you," "Afrodisiac" & "Should I Go." Must have cd of 2004...I can see why this cd is getting so much rave reviews by the press...Go cop it...You don't know what you're missing, especially you haters because I know you haven't listened to this cd...Go cop it.
5012	I want it my way: Their cd is good dance music, if you happen to like it. They've got some good tunes, I like especially the hit song "Larger Than Life", which gets me to a good mood.
5013	best of the best: How could Edward Gorey's favorite ghost stories *not* be fantastic? With his own illustrations, to boot. I'm thrilled I happened across it, because it's the best collection I've read. Every story is a little masterpiece (and every story required me to sleep with the lights on after I finished it). There isn't weak story in the collection, and if you like creepy stories, every one is a must-read.
5014	A Start into the vortex of the human condition: This book is great, but should not be considered absolute truth, It is like a guide. There were a few things that were never even gone over, like top palm hand displays, especially with women and nails, or within a fighting/opponent context, and within certain cultures, but the more you study the more you will learn. It covers a lot and gives many references and studies one can look into more thoroughly. The only thing I personally didn't like was, the journalist writing style, it is written for the "average" New York Times best seller book reader, and binding is just as horrible. It does it's job, and you will learn to "read" those around you and hopefully use that to improve your relationships with others. After all, isn't that all there really is in this life besides ourselves? The relationships we have with others? So why not try to make it pleasant for everyone.
5015	Worry no more!: This book is humorous, informative and flows well. At times it's a little gross but it's a delightful way of teaching children the "normal" functions of their little bodies at a level they can understand. As adults how many of us expect the worse from our ailments? I wish there was a book like this for us! How many times have we had the medical books out like the boy in this book. I saw this in a book store and flipped through it. After getting it from our local library I knew I had to buy it for one of the many children in my family.
5016	French Baking: Beautiful book, enticing photos and the recipes, when they work, are excellent. This is not a book for beginning bakers, though. It requires some experience with home baking and patience because some of the quantities given are not exact and need a bit of adjusting and the essembly procedures need improvisation as well. Because many of the recipes are so involved, it takes some dexterity to reach the desired look and taste of the pastries. But when it works it is superb. I enjoyed the challenges, but buyers should beware.
5017	I Rooted For The Killer Vines!: I gave this book a single star only because there is no zero. Six people find themselves trapped in the jungle by intelligent killer vines and armed Mayan villagers. I kept slogging along hoping that there would be more to this story, no such luck. Vapid characters, most of whom seem so shallow that I couldn't even muster sympathy for their plight. Tedious, predictable and way too long. After the first 100 pages I started rooting, no pun intended, for killer vines to save me from the other 200+ pages.
5018	Nothing practical: Full of stories without practical information about how to have an OBE. Dont waste your time and money on this book.
5019	Just don't like.: I used the Cisco Press Exam Certification Guide series to pass the CCNP exams. I got this one and I just don't like the higher level, skimming topics writing style. I'm not saying that I always understand the lower level stuff at first read, but I like the option of trying. The chapters I read of this book seem to offer not much more than high level topic summaries. The high number of typos bug too.
5020	ridiculous..: I had planned to order the entire eureka series, but cancelled the while thing. I refuse to support the 1/2 season scheme. Will wait until the complete collection or will just watch on-line.
5021	Great experience!!: My experience with this company was great!! I ordered my book on 8/16 and received it 8/22!!! Just in time for school!!
5022	Amazing!: John Le Carré managed to make a spy novel without all the James Bond-type paraphernalia, the story is compelling and it does not loose its sense of action.The way in which the author takes the reader from the past to the present is simply extraordinary.
5023	Amazing classics: Love every song and more importantly so did my husband. It is our new standard for the holidays. All I have to say is Clarence Carter!
5024	left in the dark: several people told me about this product so I sent off for some when I received my balls ,there was no pouch and there were no instructions on how to use them, so their only good a paper weight
5025	Another Scary, but Possible Scenario: James Wesley Rawles' "Patriots" is another of several scary novels currently available that deal with possible future events in this country and the world. And to have Mr. Rawles' work reviewed and commented on in a flattering manner by another top drawer author like Jerry Furland, "(Transfer: The end of the beginning"), is high praise indeed! Both "Patriots" and "Transfer" deliver engrossing tales that are hard to put down. Both authors see the future in a way that makes us want to pay closer attention to the current events we read and hear about every day. "Transfer" zeroes in on more of the technology that is in place or presently being developed that could make his fictional view of the future highly probable. Mr. Rawles and Mr. Furland, you guys do good work!
5026	Why didn't the New Order fans eat this up?: I remember walking into the cd store and being surprised that Electronic released another cd back in '96. Was I glad I pickedthis up! This is probably what New Order would have sounded like at this time (minus the Peter Hook bass sound). Solid throughtout. Great pop-rock somgs with more dancier numbers as well. 'Raise the pressure' went basically unnoticed here in North America.There were 4 hits from this album in the U.K: "Forbidden city", "For you', "Second nature" and "Out of my league". It seems that North America no longer listens to this kind of music.. Too bad, they're missing out on some great stuff here.
5027	ridiculous: i cannot even get to considering how good the movie is, as far as it's quality is concerned; because i just cannot get over the fact that i was extremely deeply offended by it. being turkish, i simply cannot accept the fact that this movie is around, "free" for people to view. i cannot think of a better way of creating a horrible impression of turkey in the minds of those who do not know much about the place.
5028	Junk!: Mine started acting freaky after a few weeks. Unfortunately, I didn't save the box so I'm stuck with the dumb thing.Now it sits there all days and turns it self on, tries to go through the set up stages, then turns itself off again. 10 seconds later it does it again.Don't buy this faulty mess!
5029	Banal: Ruben is a nice guy but in my estimation has never progressed beyond mediocrity in singing. "SUPERSTAR" is draggy and elongated and "Flying Without Wings" does not merit much praise either. The song is fine but would have been done better by someone else. This CD proves that the "American Idol" made a big mistake by rigging the show in Ruben's favor. In one word...banal is the way to describe this CD.
5030	Don Fardon - 'Indian Reservation / I've Paid My Dues' (Edsel): As fate would have it, I actually remember this British Invasion one-hit wonder. This is a rather nice 2-fer-1 CD import. First you get his 'Indian Reservation' ('68) effort and that lp's follow-up 'I've Paid My Dues' ('70) - see my review. Songs off the first record that more than make the grade are Fardon's cover of the Paul Revere & The Raiders hit - this disc's title track "Indian Reservation", "How Do You Break A Broken Heart", the toe-tapping "Captain Man", "Sally Goes Around The Moon", his tribute to Joe Cocker with "The Letter" and "I Need Somebody". Essential listening.
5031	3 out of 4 isn't bad.: I could not find Little Giants on DVD and the same went for Surf Ninjas. Little Big League was a plus and I still haven't and probably never will watch the other one.Quality is fine, price is great. I'm just glad I didn't have to track down a VHS copy of Little Giants to give as a gift (it's why I originally bought the collection).
5032	megamug: Used this mug in -India for 4 months...saved my life...made coffee every am with the french-press...and could fit 5 of their regular chais in the mug...best mug ever
5033	Great Buy: I have bought this item around 4 months back. I have using it in Microoven, Dish Washer or traditional cleaning. It is really good. Even lot of times it get dropped from my hand or from my wifes Hand. No scratch happened to it as well. It is real good with price.
5034	Great Book- sometimes graphic- but truly heart wrenching: I really enjoyed this book I would recommend it to anyone interested in Psychology, or DID. Cameron West went through a truly emotional ordeal and I think he did a good job of portraying it through his bio. Some descriptions of the abuse were very graphic- it was hard for me to fall asleep after reading a few chapters! Overall I think it's an excellent book that will move a person, and make a person realize how important childhood is everyones life.
5035	Still Great After All These Years: I got the CD in 1993 around the time itinitially came out (back then it came in a fully cardboard "jeewl case"), and even 13 years later the tracks still sound fresh.In fact, I have an internet radio show that uses "Ish Revenge" as its theme ;) And it is "Ish" and not "I.S.H." as the CD case stated, as the artist's real name is Ishmael Allen.
5036	Alan Rickman: This was a fun film covering a lot of people whose lives intertwined. I was sorry that alan rickman did not have a bigger part. I was glad that he wasn't "on the make" in the beginning of this film and that he did regret what he did. Hugh Grant's part was very good though his girlfriend's expletives were not needed. There were a lot of good bits in this film - too many to listn this review. It is a good movie to watch to see many different kinds of love.
5037	Excellent Product: The dip set shipped very quickly and showed up in perfect condition, very well boxed. We love the Sedona pattern and have purchased many other pieces from the collection. Very high quality! We had no problems with the bowl handling the dishwasher (on the highest setting) as well as the microwave.
5038	Yes!: I've been battling coarse hair on my chin for a couple of years. I've tried depilatories, epilators, threading, shaving and tweezing. Some have been disastrous while others just left me unsatisfied. I was a little weary to try strip free wax, but I was desperate and I felt encourage by the positive reviews. I wasn't confident with the process on my first try and I made a mess. The second try was it! Bamm! With very little pain the coarse hair was gone and I felt smooth. I've been waiting for this for a long time. I'm ecstatic. I recommend getting the electric warmer. Heating it on the stove is a pain and can alter your results. Also, make sure you have some extra spatulas. The one's provided are only good for a single use.
5039	An absolute revelation of a book!: I've ordered hundreds of books through Amazon (living in Darkest Africa, without television, is a brilliant place to get hooked on books!) and David Payne's "Early to the Dance" is by far the best I've read this year. It is sublime. A masterpiece. "A symphony" as Newsweek puts it so well. Lyrical, poetic and utterly gripping. I totally loved every moment and it left me longing for more of David Payne's work. I have now gone on to T.C. Boyle's "Riven Rock" and am PLODDING. David Payne is a hard act to follow.
5040	This book had great impact on my life: I had this book when I was little and I used to beg my mom to read it to me over and over. I loved it. It got me interested in science and research. It is at least partially due to this book that I entered college as a biology major. Highly recommended- I wish it was still in print.
5041	yes, he's a handsome vampire: Title says it all... and that's what 60% of the book is about.The vampire is handsome.And just in case we didn't mention it, the vampire is handsome.Oh... let's throw in some action at the end to kinda-sorta have a story...Please don't hate me, I read the book, I just didn't like it so much.In an ironic twist, the movie was better.
5042	Best of 70's album: I am glad that I can find this CD from internet. I love every songs in this CD. The song Even Now is classic for Barry. Copacabanna really makes fun. This CD brings me a lot of memories.
5043	Not worth your $$s: The build quality on this is not the greatest. In less than 2 months and going through two replacement units I gave up on this charge station. If I could get the unit to charge the PS3 controller I encountered issues getting the controller properly aligned with the connector on the charging station. Also note that the actual connectors on the charging station are secured by a small piece of plastic, apply too much pressure and it will break off and push the actual connector into the station.
5044	This cover art is horrible: This cover art goes against everything this series of wonderful books stands for. Anne is not a bleached blond, make-up wearing, chesty homecoming queen. She was a skinny, awkward, red-headed, freckled orphan who grew to love herself and her appearance over the course of several books and life lessons. This isn't Sweet Valley High in Canada. Whomever chose this cover art should be fired because they either never bothered to read the book or they are trying to use sex to sell a book about a 10 year old girl.
5045	Great for the perfect party!: This cookbook is perfect for entertaining. I have used these recipes time and time again to rave reviews. I had an Oscar Party last night and the food was a huge hit! I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys cooking and entertaining. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have...happy cooking!
5046	To whom it may concern...: I really have been enjoying this CD. I got it a few hours ago and have listened to it twice already. The lyrics are great for the dark mood times. It's musically satisfying too. I hope it does well and doesn't get caught up in the comparison game.
5047	I must dissapoint you: I'm sorry to dissapoint you, but because of music rights disputes, the second season will most likley stay ureleased for the remainder of our lifetime.
5048	This CD is unreal, don't think twice about buying it!!!: First off, if you have not heard The Lost Trailers on disc or in person, do what it takes to get your hands on "Welcome to the Woods" or go out and see a show. This album is filled with 14 of the best tracks the Trailers have ever recorded. They mix a southern rock, blues and good old fashioned guitar to produce a sound that is hard to find. It is only a matter of time before these guys make it big so pick this album up today!
5049	A simplistic view of Darwinism: Oh boy, this book is baaaad. A simplistic view of Darwinism wrapped in a pedantic package. Stay clear of it.
5050	Mountains beyond Mountains: Wow! Talk about an amazing human being. I felt so unaccomplished, and yet very inspired.
5051	eh..: it stopped my crazily excessive perspiration, but this product makes my underarms itch to an extreme. maybe im using too much... o_O
5052	Best Film Ever: This is by far one of the most absolute best foreign films I have ever scene. Like a critic said this is the "feel good movie of the year". It's colorful, vibrant, silly and amusing. How wonderful it is. If you like the simple pleasures in life this movie would be perfect for you.
5053	Pairs well with...: Many of the recipes herein pair well with some Tuscan Whole Milk, 128 oz. Just make sure not to get any of that traditional Cherokee dish, Herbed Tomatoes, on your Three Wolf Moon shirt.
5054	Good: They are very good, but you have to be carefull for not leaving water to them because they get rusted.
5055	Only have of the episodes on each of the 2 discs were viewable.: Not a product in good or excellent condition. Only half of the total episodes were viewable. The other episodes would not advance. Waste of my money.
5056	great movie: I love John Pinette and i love the fact that his DVDs are available on amazon.com, because you cant buy them in stores right now.
5057	WTF???? Who the hell thought of this?: Awful. Iron Maiden should sue. Maybe this is Sharon Osbourne's revenge.
5058	Puffery!: The author writes that when he was a journalist he "practiced my own brand of censorship." Hello? And he calls himself a reporter? This guy was a flak for the casinos who is doing nothing but tooting his own horn with this so-called tell-all. Buy "Green Felt Jungle." It's a classic and REALLY tells the story of old Las Vegas.
5059	Poor software support: I have discovered that this product does not run on windows 7.That's understandableIt only supports up to win 2000.Therefore it is now not useable in the real world.Rather download the cnc simulator for free and use that withanother textbook.It seems to me that these guys have never bothered to stay upto date with the relevant operating systems. I got caughtout on the first edition of this book and now again.Cheers
5060	Beware of dealing w/Allergy Be Gone.: I buy a lot of these masks for work. For the second time, I purchased a few boxes from Allergy Be Gone. The first time, they switched the Plus masks out for the older style of 8210 (w/rubber bands). I had to return those first masks for a refund. The newer masks are more comfortable, protect longer. After drawing Amazon's scrutiny the first time. I thought perhaps they'd learned to deliver what they advertise. I guess not. It's about a year later, & they're still at it. What they are doing amounts to theft. It's a Bait & Switch. The older masks are cheaper. This Ad calls for a 60 count box of the Plus masks. That's NOT what you'll get. Allergy Be Gone didn't even bother to return my e-mail query this time. I've had to start a complaint claim through Amazon. Don't reward this kind of behavior.
5061	The Winds of War: I can highly recommend this 1st series followed by War & Remembrance which is a must. Well produced great acting very moving account of the plight of the Jews during the Nazi regime.
5062	No problems at all: I have both the medium size and small size OXO scoops and like them a lot. They make distributing muffin batter and cookie dough so much faster and everything bakes evenly. I haven't had any problems with dough sticking or jamming, but heavier muffin batter does plop out easier than lighter, stickier cookie dough. I found it easier to discharge when I let the cookie dough barely touch the baking pan - it comes out without the need to snap my wrist. I also spray them with non-stick cooking spray before using them. I've put them through the dishwasher many times and they've held up well.
5063	really great album: The best album I've come across that makes progressive house and trance a really great pair.
5064	DO NOT BUY FROM HIM!: Very disappointed with this seller. He did not inform me that he sold the book I purchased to another person until I contacted him, a month after I purchased it. I strongly reccommend not to buy any product from this person even though it may be cheaper than other items.
5065	Not up to standard: I am an avid Anita Shreve fan and have purchased and read all her books. A Wedding in December was definitely not worthy of her. I was so disappointed, I considered asking for my money back.
5066	Warning: The marketing is great; the content is "Poop": I found it disappointing even though I was seeking clean humor. Here is an example of an entire page: "The little sandwich went into a bar. He slid up onto the bar stool and inquired, "May I get something to eat?" The bartender looked down at the little sandwich and answered, "No! We don't serve food here!" This book sells for $7.95 new. Amazon charges $3.95 just to return it. If you like the sample, you'll love this book. I didn't. According to the cover, this is purported to be one of the "funniest jokes ... through out the country." I get it. He didn't say what country.
5067	Cosmo Review: I purchased a year of Cosmo for my 18 year old niece! The price was amazing and I think it was one of her favorite gifts.
5068	Fight No More: Most "professionals" try to make fighting acceptable in relationships and I think that is to justify their own weaknesses. This book makes a good case that fighting is indeed not healthy, but can cause massive destruction in a relationship. I've never met any couple who characterizes their relationships as "blissful" if they are frequent fighters. I admire Michael Webb, author of The RoMANtic's Guide. He is one of the few professionals who say fighting is harmful but he also gives wonderful ways to fill your relationship with love instead.
5069	Holes Review by the really tall girl on the white team: The boys at Camp Green Lake are not just diging to build character. That is just what the Warden has people thinking in Louis Sachar's book known as Holes. Louis Sachar writes this book by discribing 3 stories in 1. In the book a boy named Stanley Yelnats is sent to Camp Green Lake because of fate. He doesnt know that there is alot mare to Camp Green Lake that meets the eye. Stanley 's History goes back extremely far (100 years to be exact) Stanley doesnt realise he is going to encounter an exciting adventure. Louis Sachar writes this book in a suspenful way and makes the reader keep guessing what is going to happen. Even though I liked the book I think at the end Louis Sachar could have been more discriptive at the end . He leaves alot of questions unanswered and I wish he would have given us more Answers
5070	nice looking for the price: This cabinet is well packed and the finish looks good. Assembled in about 40 minutes but a power screwdriver would have helped with the drawer. When adding the top to the base I had to stack books on it to level all four corners. Pay attention during this step because you need to decide how you are going to hang the glasses (either two or three rows accessed forward). Also tap the wood plugs in gently as I split the wood from using a hammer too hard. Overall satisfied.
5071	I wanted the Power - But didn't get It: I had a WaterPik many years ago, and have really missed it. The Interplak just doesn't have enough power. I was able to use Level 7 from day 1. Since it doesn't have much power, I run out of water before making it around my whole mouth. It is better than nothing, but I wish it had more pressure so I would feel more refreshed. My suggestion is - keep looking for a WaterPik.
5072	Dangerous sharp corners: Be careful . . while this storge unit is sturdy and attractive, the corners are extremely pointy and hard AND at eye level for toddlers. I have the cabinet with the 6 openings. I was very disapointed to have to put rubber safety corners all around. Even the 4 corners on the bottom of the unit are sharp. I have never seen kids furniture with sharp pointy corners. I wrote an email to the company but haven't received a responses. Pass on this one if you have kids in the house!
5073	EASY GOIN' !: Who wouldn't LOVE this movie? It's one my kids loved and we're kinda reviving it by passing it around and laughing and remembering...now that they're grown and one is out of state, this has been fun!
5074	Terrible, just terrible.: I got this game based on a preview video I watched. Sexy girl, big guns, stuff blowing up, whats not to like right? Boy was I wrong. There is very little to do in this game. Theres no ammo to pick or health to find (you have unlimited ammo and your health regenerates pretty fast). The enemy AI is horrible as well as your allies. Aiming your weapon is difficult and jerky. You run FOREVER through unnecessarily vast landscapes. There is very little challenge. I played the game for a few HOURS praying for something interesting to happen. Finally after two or three stages, I come upon what i perceived to be a boss. Big guy 4 or 5 stories tall with a giant machine gun for an arm. Yes! Finally something to do...I killed him with one spell...seriously...I didn't even have to move. I could go on and on but I wont. Dont buy this game, dont rent it, forget it ever existed.
5075	ONE OF THE BEST DISNEY HAS TO OFFER!: I know there are a lot of critics out there that don't enjoy how Disney has not stayed true to the original story of Hercules. However, how many other movies are not completely true to the originals or even to the "real life" events that actually occurred. (Even the fan-adored-Leo-loving Titanic wasn't true to all the facts and/or people represented on the screen)Take a second and just sit back and enjoy this animated masterpiece. The wit of Disney story-telling shines through with a perfect fit of rousing musical numbers. All of this, and still you get characters full of charisma and heart (not all, but most).I'm sure that you will find something that you will find appealling, whether it be a new insight on something in your own life, or even one as simple as experiencing a creative and touching Disney film for a few hours.Absolute seal of approval from this Disney fan!
5076	Essential for Delphi .Net developer: The book covers an excellent range of topics. As both Delphi and .Net are large subjects I think Xavier has managed the content very well.The book is easy to read and the examples are very easy to follow.The Delphi 6 Developers Guide on CD is also a nice bonus if you are still developing for Win32 in Delphi 6/7.What I expect out of this type of book is to reduce my learning curve and allow me to start writing programs, Delphi for .NET Developer's Guide has certainly done that for me.If you are going to write .NET programs in Delphi than you want this book on your shelf.
5077	Best Moments for this Groundbreaking (but tired) Musical: "Cats" was extremely important for its time & paved the way for many future musicals. Currently, its the longest running show in Broadway history ... thankfully, though, Mr. Webber's masterpiece, "Phantom of the Opera" will take the crown in early 2006.Despite a talented Company (esp. Betty Buckley, Ken Page & Terrence Mann), the score has generally not aged well and seems rather trite by today's standards. However, the production's best moments are showcased nicely in this "selections" version of the classic show:Jellicle Songs For Jellicle CatsRum Tum TuggerMr. MistoffeleesMemory (THE classic!)While the full two-cd score may be more complete, the "selections" cd (fortunately) eliminates most of the show's filler. I only wish the Overture had been included as well.
5078	Sadly - made in the U.S.A.: When I took it out of the box one of the rubber feet fell off. I was amazed to find that the rubber feet are attached with glue and staple. Really? Shouldn't these be screwed on? Initially I was happy to see that this product is made in the U.S.A., but now I'm just embarassed. With the cheap design of the feet, I couldn't trust that the board itself was manufactured properly, so I just returned it. The last thing I want is to have the board splitting at the seams a month or so down the road. Buyer beware.
5079	Very basic & Ignores Contemporary sport Science Research Findings: Neither the text of this book, nor the "About the Authors" section, demonstrates any background specific to sport science or athletic training. The book does contain a very readable and pleasant introduction to general nutrition and exercise, with many excellent illustrations, and is a good book for school libraries and health classes.Unfortunately I do not feel that this book lives up to it's title, and will probably not be usefully to competitive athletes at any level or fitness serious adults.For personal trainers, coaches, and athletes with some biology or chemistry foundation I would strongly recommend "Sport Nutrition: An Introduction to Energy Production and Performance" by A. Jeukendrup & M. Gleeson, which is a very up to date (published 2004), comprehensive, and peer reviewed treatment of the subject.
5080	Ella Enchanted, ME!: I really enjoyed this book. Though I will admit it was a little slow starting out. Let me give you some backround. When Ella was born a spell was put on her, a spell that commanded her to do whatever she was told. After her mother dies Ella is determined to find the witch who casted the spell and ask her to put away the spell. will Ella even find the witch? Thar is for me to know and you to find out!
5081	I Learn Again Not to Trust Reviews: I bought this book because of enthusiastic reviews. But, "blah blah blah" is right! I wish I could remember which reviewers recommended this book. I want always in the future to do the opposite of whatever they suggest. (Maybe they were among Conlon's many relatives?) How did Conlon get through a Harvard English class? Boring, badly-written book. Sophomoric at best. Waste of money; waste of time. Mr. Conlon do not write again. Please.
5082	too big for smaller bikes, but it's a great pack: It's a well constructed pack, with plenty of room for your phone, keys, bike tools, pump, etc. It's just too big for a smaller sized frame. I ride a Marin San Rafael 15", and the bag is just too big to fit comfortably. Forget having a bottle cage attached if you try to use this pack, the pack takes up every bit of space, and sticks out far enough on the sides to rub on my legs while I ride. If you have a bigger bike, this bag is great, but on smaller bikes, pass on it.
5083	Isn't all this stuff a NO DUH?!?!: Come on girls... think with your heads! The problem we women have is that we think too much with our hearts, and we stop seeing what's right in front of us. Maybe if we woke up collectively, books like this wouldn't have to be written. Having said all that, the book was well-written, but for what I paid for it, I expected it to last more than 4 hours (which is what it took me to finish it). If you've been through the married man, the man that will never get married again, the relationship with no passion, and any variations of the aforementioned, I think you will find this book not quite as interesting as many of the readers do.
5084	Rota-point toothpicks: I've used Rota-Point toothpicks for many years. My dentist used to sell them for $1.00/box!!!She's now retired. How many do I have to buy to get a discounted price? The prices you have listed here are absolutely ridiculous when I know I've gotten them all these years for $1.00 per box..
5085	Great toy: This thing seems indestructable. My dog chews on it and throws it around the house. I tried putting the treats in it, but my dog had too much trouble getting them out. I now put yogurt in it and freeze it for a while. When I need to go somewhere, I put it in the crate with my dog. It gives her an activity and lasts for quite a while. When she plays with it outside of her crate, it is fun to watch. She will drop it on the floor and it will begin to roll. It goes in circles and my dog seems to be fascinated in watching it roll. Overall, a good buy for the dog.
5086	Stunning!: One of the two most beautiful, peaceful, lovely and fun lullaby albums I've ever heard. Fantastic for both children and adults. The soft jazz style is delightful and soothing. The entire play list is completely harmonious, one track moving to the next in perfection. I enjoy this album so much, going to sleep, waking up as well as during the day. An exquisite artistic treasure of musical healing.
5087	Angels of the universe: I tought i should let people know tha the album is aktually a soundtrack from a movie and if you kan you should rent it somewhere (Don't ask me where to get it) i live in Iceland and the move is very popular here but i don't know about other country's
5088	Garth is really hot in this one!!!: My favorite is "It Don't Matter to the Sun"...Garth really hit it with this one. If anyone could pull this off, Garth is the one!!
5089	1 star because: It's NOT AVAILABLE!: As soon as they release a reprint of this DVD, they can 5 stars... but until then, boooo! hissssss!
5090	handy sport watch.: a handsome and durable sport watch with all the necessary features for any level of sportsmen.
5091	The Bourne Legacy: Not as good as Jason Bourne. The movie is too cut up and difficult to follow. Action is ok but I don't think it is up to par with other Bourne movies
5092	Powerful tale of Nazi-occupied Poland.: This book tells the traditional fairy tale from a different angle. What if the witch was really a misunderstood old woman? What if the father and stepmother left Hansel and Gretel for a good reason? The story takes place in Nazi-occupied Poland, and describes how two Jewish children--called Hansel and Gretel by their stepmother--survive. I thought the writer did an excellent job of describing what life was like in Poland then. Not only the Nazi aspect of it, but also what it was like when Russia occupied it before the Nazi's did. It is a brutally realistic story. The only flaw I found with the book (and why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5) is that the character's motives sometimes aren't explained very well. For instance, we never fully learn why Magda changes her mind and lets the children stay. And what was her life like before the kids come? Not much explanation is given to that either. But overall, this is a remarkable book. I highly recommend it.
5093	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer: I love it! Some parts I couldn't understand because of the language but The Adventures of Tom Sawyer will always be an all time favorite of mine!!
5094	Atlas of the Tolkien-made world of Middle-Earth with more!: If someone think this is an illustrated account stretching from Mordor in the east to Hobbitun and the sea in the west, think again. This is an extensive atlas featuring maps and backgroundstory for everything Tolkien wrote!Its put chronologically from the first age until the third age and also chronologically following the events in the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.All in all a "must have" for Lord of the Rings-fan.
5095	LIAR: Terrible, but wonderful at the same time. I am glad that she has become a leading spokesperson for the conservatives in this country. She is a liar, mean-spirited, and someone who only complains and doesn't offer any suggestions. Check out her attempt to document her "sources" and her flimsy endnotes. She bends the "truth" to suit her own needs. No she isn't the first, or the last, but I really don't know how this woman sleeps at night. Only in America.....
5096	Please remember your manners when writing about manners!: I am most disappointed with "How to Raise a Gentleman" by Kay West. The beginning was promising with concise "rules" and practical examples to explain them. Unfortunately, around the midpoint of the book the author appears to forget her purpose...and her manners. Vulgar vocabulary and excessively described, equally vulgar situations take the place of previously delicate and succinct wording. Readers hoping to improve their overall etiquette and social standing do not need to be reminded of the multitude of slang terms used in place of more socially correct, tactful terms. Sadly this is not the first "etiquette" book I have had this experience with. Etiquette authors: please edit and publish your work with higher standards and the intelligence of your readers in mind.
5097	worth listening to: Picked this CD up by accident and was pleasantly surprised at how many really nice songs!!
5098	Deeper Thought Required: I am fond of this film, and I highly recommend this movie to those who wish to head-on challenge their sensibilities. Also, those who wish to think. The major content of this movie is a real slap in the face, but it's important to understand the underlying allegory, which I'm not as well-equipped as others to explain. Maybe read more about it in warning, then keep the most open mind possible.
5099	Decent: Earth Crisis doing a Misfits cover?? Wow... WEIRD but very cool. Some of the covers I din't like but I am more into the metal/HC scene. Punk/ska fans would probably give this the extra star.
5100	Real Coconut!!! Great Product: This has real coconut mixed in with hermit crab flakes! I love this product, and i love all the HBH hermit crab items. But to make the food better I went to the store and bout some coconut and put some in with the food (EXTRA COCONUT) and they all go crazy over the coconut!! Hermits prefer real fruits and veggies rather than pellets or flakes though, i still recomend this to mix it up.
5101	Very good story teller: This book firmly belongs to sub-genre of legal thrillers.That usualy means some confusing crime(mostly murder)has been described in a confusing manner in order to confuse the reader.I don't read many of those books.They are more plot driven and weaker on character developement then I prefer.All that said, Mr.Ellis is a very good story teller and even if I am not a convert to legal mystery as such, I wouldn't mind reading few more of his books.
5102	Good District of Columbia Flag Good Price: Needed a District of Columbia Flag to complete a shadow box. Got the flag now all I have to do is put everything together. Good Shipping and Good Price....
5103	good cd arrived in excellent shape: Cd was missing from my collection and this one arrived in excellent shape exactly as described. would purchase again from this selller
5104	Gritty and Gross: I bought 2 varieties of Dr McDougall's dried soups, the black bean and lime, and the tamale. The tamale soup is crazy gritty and gross. You can let it sit and rehydrate as long as you want and stir forever, and it is still like eating a mouthfull of tortilla chip flavored sand. I went back to the bean soup just to make sure my stirring technique was correct, then tried one more of the tamale. Nope, still gritty and gross. If you can get past that though, the flavor is alright. My boyfriend's son tried it too. I found it in the fridge with one spoonful missing. He said he put it in there "in case anyone else wanted it". Yeah right. Straight into the garbage.
5105	Worth the money!: I own both PSP XI and Adobe Photoshop CS. I paid 700.00 for Adobe and about 80.00 for PSP XI. I really like PSP for editing my photos and creating slides. It has a lot a great features that are MUCH easier and faster to perform in PSP than they are in Adobe PS. It is a little buggy in that it does shut itself down every now and then, but it opens right back up. I am a software application manager and developer and I can tell you NO software comes without bugs. The ones I have found here are not enough to keep me from loving this program.For the money, it is a great buy. I am sure Corel will have a patch for the shut down problem soon, as long as users report the problem.Bottom Line: If you wnat an affordable solution to edit and create fun and beautiful photos and slide shows, this product does very well!
5106	INVINCIBLE....Whoops! That title is taken!: If MJ had jettisoned 1/3 of his last album, hooked up with Timbaland and other contemporary hip-hop masters, added his sister Janet on a cut, threw in some funky beats, did some patented "screams", then he might have had the winner that Timberlake has.I dig the seductive "Senorita", "Take It From Here", "Rock Your Baby" "Let's Take A Ride", and the slammin' "Last Night".If Timberlake can maintain this level in his sophomore effort, he may have a career beyond his "boyhood".He'll do fine as long as he doesn't completely emulate his hero and become a prisoner of his own success.
5107	Stupid CD: And whoever said I suck, they suck. They are blind and deaf. And in my opinion, Coldplay doesn't rock. They need manners.So shut up, whoever that was.
5108	Don't Waste Your Money!: When I saw this, I thought it would be a good item for me because I make quesdillas for lunch most days. After using it ONE time.... I discovered that I could make them faster and easier using a big frying pan on top of the stove. Since that is the way I made them before..... this was a total waste of money. The only reason I gave it 1 star is that it's a great color. It is now just taking up cupboard room and will be thrown away or sold at a garage sale soon.
5109	The Wrong Memory Card: I have this memory card. After I have saved about 8 mb on it I try to save something on it but it keeps on saying "Save Failed" "Save Failed" "Save Failed" "Save Failed". It has been driving me crazy and that is why I am buying a new memory card right this second.
5110	This is a great cd !: This is a really good album. Here's a song-by-song review:1.Another Dumb Blonde - This is a good song (#3). It was in the Nickelodian movie Snow Day. A good girl power song.2.What You Need - This song is Ok (#5). It has good lyrics and a nice beat.3.How Do I Feel (The Burrito Song) - This is my 2nd fav. song (#2). I like it's beat and it has cool lyrics.4.Just Enough - I love this song (#1). It's really pretty and it's catchy. If you don't like it, then you're just a NERGET !(don't ask)5.Oxygen - This is a good song (#4). It's catchy and fun.6.Nothing In This World - I don't like this song (#10)7.In The First Place - This song is Ok (#6)8.Every Time - I don't like this song (#9)9.I'm Scared - I don't like this song (#11)10.We Will Follow The Sun - This song is Ok (#7)11.You First Believed - I don't like this song (#10)
5111	Each one worse than the last: I first read this book years ago, but that copy got lost and I was overjoyed to find it again. My siblings and I all wanted it when Dad gave away his library.Mr Capstick is a wonderfully descriptive writer! Each one of the big eight African game animals has a chapter; and each is the very worst way to die. Capstick does not skimp on the gory details, but he is entertaining and real. He spent many years in the Africian bush and obviously knows each of these animals very, very well.I worked with a gentleman who met Capstick while in Africia and he reported that the man in the book is the same man in real life. If you want a different view of Africa from the Disneyification of wildlife this is the book for you.
5112	Useful: I have 3 of these in work and home windows. The've been reliable, accurate, and are easy to read. Recommended.
5113	Extremely disappointed: I love Leslie and her videos. I have several and I was looking for something to just change up my exercise routine. I don't mind the repetition in steps but this was extremely hard to follow. I'm surprised it got Leslie's, and her company, approval for release. The video itself was very cut up. The steps of the 2 mile walk, and the other walkers, was hard to follow. I'll continue to use some of my other videos but I would not recommend this one. I'm glad it wasn't my first experience with a Leslie Sansone Walk Away the Pounds.
5114	Complete Soundtrack is Anything But: After watching The Weeping Meadow I immediately ordered the "complete soundtrack" CD because the music is hauntingly beautiful. I play the accordion and wanted to learn the stunning accordion audition, as well as the other pieces of music played 1) in the tavern, 2) the dancehall, 3) the musicians railcar, and 4) the funeral raft. The CD contains only a number of versions of the main theme - as beautiful as that theme is - but none of the above music. And the accordion audition piece is played poorly, seemingly by a different musician. I couldn't have been more disappointed.
5115	Holy Jumpin' Jimmy Cricket: Wow. I have been a big fan of batman for sometime, even now that I'm 16. However, the only batman film I own woukd be Batman and Robin, but enough about that.I saw Batman: Return of the joker on cartoonnet work, twice. The Joker, even if I am slightly uneasied by clowns, is my all time favourtie villian.This score is the best. Peeps, I am stunned for words on it.
5116	stokes field guide to birds-eastern region: Stokes Field Guide to Birds-Eastern Region is one of the best bird books around. It is very informative and the pictures are great!
5117	Nice.: Obviously a key purchase. Haven't tried any other brands of this "type" of product since this is the most advertised but it certainly does the job. Need I say more? Not to mention there is always free shipping of this product from Amazon and is prompt with its delivery. Will buy again from here.
5118	Pulls in stations from 75 miles with seperate added amp: This one pulls my stations in from 75 miles. I am on a hill, unit is in garage attic. I added amp from wal-mart and am very pleased.
5119	Excellent Polish: This polish does a great job on my Allen Edmonds dress shoes. Easy to apply, good color. However, leave your shoes in the closet for a couple of days or the polish will come off on your pants cuffs.
5120	Don't get ripped off! Avoid this book like the plague.: I bought this book in the english book section at the Munich airport. I was intrigued by the title's appendix " . . Case Closed". Well, to close a case you need some proof. To put it simply, Cornwell has none. Beyond that simple fact, you should be aware that this book is rambling and poorly organized. Don't waste your time reading to the end thinking that Cornwell will finally come to the point and prove her case. She never presents one shred of meaningful evidence, not even with her dubious DNA testing. A total ripoff of a book. I can't imagine that she isn't being sued by someone representing the artist Walter Sickert, whom she accuses of being a serial killer.
5121	Testing may not be enough !!!!: So got the product tested on hand for about a week. Said ok.Then placed it on neck are where the razor bumps were.After 2 days razor bumps are going away, but I HAVE A HUGE FREAKING RASH ON MY NECK.So testing may not be enough because different parts of the skin may react differently.If anyone has any solutions please tell me.
5122	Pokemon Stadium: Pokemon Stadium is a very cool game. It is basiclly a regular trainer battle from the gamebuy games except in full animation and a little bit better. It's a little bit better because there are different settings you can do. For example there is "Tournament mode."
5123	Green Arrow first flight with toy: The movie itself is great, its one of the better story wise to the original origins of green lantern to the later half of the comics. the toy its nice to have but would of like it to be a 7-9inch toy than a 3-5inch toy.
5124	This book was not authorized by Clay Aiken: This book was not authorized by Clay Aiken, and I know this for a FACT!! She has taken what others have said, and combined this information. We do NOT know what is true if a book is NOT AUTHORIZED, and therefore, should not be purchased!! Kathleen Tracy is trying to capitolize on Clay's name for her own monetary benefit. If she was truly a fan, she would not have done this!! She never interviewed Clay or his mother. I do hope you will post this. If people REALLY want to read about Clay, they need to read "Learning to Sing, and Hearing The Music." THIS IS AN AUTHORIZED BOOK...
5125	Will warm your room and heart..................: This CD will become a nice addition to your holiday music.....Justin Hayward captures the warmth of the holiday season...a fire, some friends and drink....sit back and just enjoy....the sad part....the album is without Ray Thomas...his voice would have added much.....happy holidays to all and peace on earth.....
5126	Can't even give this away: I was so excited to receive this hair dryer when it came in the mail! Well if you have fine straight hair do yourself a favor. Don't purchase this. Mybeautiful blond hair is so limp from it that it has become a waste of time using it. I tried numerous times not to put anything in it such as stylingproducts but it did not make a difference. My girlfriend who has thick curly hair whom I considered just giving it to her if she liked it said shedidn't like it at all! It's too late to return it which is definitely my own fault. I am looking for something else to replace it with but I am a littlehesitant to purchase over the internet.
5127	sort of works: noisy even when no nearby channels. useless when frequency is occupied by any transmission, however weak. wish i'd kept my packaging, would certainly not recommend.
5128	"Gotta Get It": This is a "Gotta Get It!!". Every once in awhile a book comes along for the music fan or record/music collector that's a "Gotta Get It". This is certainly one of them. Did you love WLS in the 1960's? Are you a music/record collector? Are you a music survey enthusiast? If you answered "yes" to any one of those questions, then this book is a "Gotta Get It"!! It's very easy to use and very concise. I'm a record/music collector (and have been for many many years) and I always want to grab a book and find the precise information that I need very quickly. This will give you precise WLS chart information from the 1960 through 1969. In short, it's a "Gotta Get It" and Gotta Get It NOW!!!
5129	Waste of money: This cd was expertly hyped, but is totally overrated. I bought this cd after seeing her perform on "Oprah", and loved the song "Fallin", but that is the ONLY good song on the entire cd. Your editorial review says it best, she "WAILS". I don't call that "singing".
5130	It's a Lightweight: I purchased to use with leaf and snow blowers and use a 14/3 extension cord. I couldn't get it to work with that gauge and I doubt anyone can. I should have read the reviews more carefully. Probably good with more typical, lighter load cords.
5131	Not great - why all the hype?: We are watching this on Netflix now, and I know the only reason we have gotten so far into it is because there is no wait between episodes. They are all supposed to be these brilliant minds, yet there is NO brilliance! The incredibly naive main character is supposed to have this fantasic legal mind, but she seems to have trouble figuring out whats for lunch; no way she could make it out of law school. The attorneys from Law and Order are more interesting.Most annoying the obvious manipulation is really over the top; its like watching with a bunch of 6th grade girls. Insults followed by flattery, then more insults. Golly is Patty really my friend?Something to watch if you are bored, buti really don't see how this show could confuse or thril anyone.
5132	More heavy handedness from Lehane.: More heavy handedness from Lehane. It is both predictable and unoriginal. Rings untrue. A violent mental patient left to wander unobstructed, injuring guards, injuring patients as part of his treatment. Come on? Follows the pattern of every schizo book or movie ever in print. Remember Fight Club. Setting it on an Island in the 50s does not make it fresh.
5133	The book that helped me get me were i am now.: well the book was the best and i love to play soccer when i want to. It's my to play.I want to go to collage soccer some were were they play really good and to be a good thing for me. well maybe i will be able to go and play with the big boys.
5134	Watch it the tv guide channel.: This movie was like watching train reck that I could not look away from. There was so many things wrong with the story and timeline. The people who made this had Michael Jackson looking like a man with out a back bone. The events were out of place, the plastic surgeries scenes weird and most disturbing to me his skin color not right at all. They were not consistant on that deail at all. The way they had it was that he still had dark skin when he met Lisa Marie in 1992 and he did not. She was still married when the first started talking and he did want to have sex with her before they got married. They had a far better wedding in this movie then they did in real life and they skip over the BAD album all together. Which is a pretty good album if people would just listen to it, I love all his albums from Motown Jackson 5 to Invincible. My point is if you want to see this this movie watch it on tv and save your money. Or better yet don't watch it at all.
5135	if you aint true to yoself then you aint true to nobody: Words of wisdom from the iceman,the soundtrack,the movie plot,the 1991 street slang ,it all was all kickin,if everyone had an open mind about this movie,they too would be a "COOL AS ICE FAN AS WELL",This is truely a classic and vanilla will always be the king of rap!kat drop that zero and get wit the hero,yep yep.
5136	Pinnacle 500 USB is worthless: While this product has been advertised as "simple" and "easy-to-use", it is actually slow, buggy, and completely useless. I purchased this so that I could burn DVD's from the video I record with my Canon ZR200 digital video camera. I've encountered nothing but problems and frustration with it. First of all, the USB connection from the product will simply disappear while I am capturing video (and this is after the 10.5.2 version is installed). Then, if I get lucky and am able to capture any video, the DVD creation fails every time. Of course there is no error message or troubleshooting information to explain why the DVD creation fails. This isn't to mention the extreme slowness of the application. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this piece of junk.
5137	Disgusting, distasteful movie:(: This movie is too gross to be taken seriously. I thought it was meaningless ( what entertainment does it provide us ). Was it made to make us lose our lunches? It was disgusting. The so-called "scary music" was phony and lame. The acting is HORRIBLE, and the special effects are cheesy and awkward. This movie isn't worth the dirt of my shoes. It's totally gross.
5138	Grant's Greatest: Another "cool jazz" classic by the talented Mr. Green. This was Grant's best effort from his traditional jazz years which ran thru the mid 60's, before he started to experiment with soul, funk, and bebop later in his career. Standouts from the album include "My Favorite Things" & "Bedouin".Grant was probably the most under-appreciated jazz artist to ever record an album. Since his untimely death at the age of 43, he has slowly begun to attract the critical accaim he deserved. The evolution of "acid jazz" in the 90's, also lead a resurgence of younger fans as Grant's music was very popular in the genre.
5139	SO refreshing!: I got a great deal on this item at a Big Lot for 75 cents per bottle. Wish I bought more! They are most refreshing orange tasted soda that I ever tried. Naturally colored, use pure cane sugar that is not overwhelmingly sweet. $39 per 12 bottles seem a bit too expensive for me to buy them constantly, though.
5140	AWFUL!: This product is terrible. I didn't even get to use it once! As soon as I put my mug underneath (or attempted to) I realized it was too big to fit! Why is there no off button? It seems ridiculous to have to make sure I have water in it BEFORE I plug it in. It's going right back in the box and going back! Horrible product with limited usability!
5141	So bad its good: When my brother bought this compilation ~10 years ago he was dazzled by the games the package in office depo displayed.In short, there was a good game or two out of the 300. I used the worst games to find ways to annoy my brother and he eventually was driven to destroy the disc completely or face complete insanity... These "worst" types of games were in no short supply.Overall even though I didn't buy it the entertainment value was definitely worth it. If you like things that are so bad they are good you may find something here.Otherwise, stay away. Far, far away.
5142	An educational book that actually motivates!!!: Communication...Mr. Boyd reminds me just how important this subject really is and that I have room for improvement. His understanding and ability to teach his proven methods through his writing is superb.The most impressive characteristic of the book to me was Mr. Boyd's enthusiasm for his message that drips from the book, and how his enthusiasm transferred to me. I found myself very motivated to take action and following his suggestions. Powerful stuff!
5143	Sansa MP3 Player , Poor Quality: This is now the third Sansa player that has died in a very short time.... very disappointed as it was a present for my son. I won;t be buying anymore Sansa...
5144	It's okay: Cheaper than the one I have but not a better quality won't repurchase. Also no very nonstick : ( : (
5145	These Guys Are A Joke!!!: Man, this cd and ALL of Cannibal Corpse's cds SUCK! The beats are extremely repetitive and are completely lousy, the guitar riffs are even worse, the lyrics are beyond disgusting, the lead "singer" can't scream well at all and when when he trys it sounds like he's got a sh--load of food in his mouth. Most christian heavy-metal groups blow this crap away! To give you a short list, Living Sacrifice, Zao, Extol, Project-86, Blindside, P.O.D., Eternal Decision, Piller, Embodyment and Travail. If you ever some how get a hold of this cd, first smash the hell out of it with a sledgehammer and burn it!!! Peace.
5146	Good product but...: Great product but just for future reference you should mention that the CD ROM that is included is a mini CD and not the regular size. My laptop doesn't handle that size.
5147	Suk, Janacek & Martinu classical music: This product arrived swiftly in very good condition. I have played the entire CD am delighted to have it. Excellent service and fairly priced.
5148	I so much wanted to like this album...: ...I had read rave reviews and love Airey's work with Ozzy and Purple. Turns out the album is a collection of 80's sinth-pop, combined with a generic vocal performance. I hate myself for saying this, but I think it's little better than the Rocky IV soundtrack. Off the whole album, I'd probably just save the 13th track, Song for Al (reprise), a solid 80's rock tune. I don't find anything particularly pleasing in the rest of the album, but my least-disliked tracks are Balti Lament, Can't Make up Your Mind and Death Zone - Whiteout. Apparently this stuff is not my cup of tea. I'm happy to hear someone (the other reviewer and his family) appreciates it, I just wish I would too, since Airey is a classic keyboardist and Cozy Powell was a fantastic drummer. But this doesn't do the trick for me.
5149	Expertly painted portrait of dislikable woman: Sometimes, you empathize with a character because he/she is genuinely likable--for example, David Copperfield. Other times, you aren't too keen on what you see. Such is the case with Mrs. Bridge.This weak, repressed woman is a product of upper-class Kansas City in the 1940's. Thanks to her workaholic husband, she has everything she wants--everything material, anyway. Her empty feelings are another matter.The author has done a good job of portraying Mrs. Bridge, but I wanted to meet her and smack her. She's prejudiced against all sorts of ethnicities, and she is pretty passive and spineless in general.The book is a pretty quick read, with lots of vignettes but not much of substance going on. Just as well, because I couldn't take more than 30-60 minutes at a time of this woman.
5150	can't get enough of Christopher Moore: As I said, I can't get enough from this author. I don't think I've read one book of his that I didn't like - and I've read almost all of them. Love his sarcasm and humor. Definitely recommend this book!
5151	Not worthy of an afternoon on the beach ...: I loved The Devil Wears Prada and was so looking forward to reading her sophomore effort. However, I was so disappointed. As others mentioned, this is a formulaic attempt at chick-lit, and a poor attempt at that.If a book is going to be interesting to me, I have to care about the characters and be able to even slightly relate to the situations they find themselves in. At no point do I care even slighlty about Bette or her predicaments. Characters appear and disappear, or they find themselves useful for only a chapter and then are gone. It truly seemed that the author had all of these great ideas, but she wasn't sure how to pull them all together, so she just threw together the pages of the manuscript and then wrote a paragraph to transition between chapters.If you really feel that you must read this book then borrow it from the library. It's not worth seven or eight bucks.
5152	Very Disappointing: This book disappoints on many fronts. The characterization of Batman as a Christian soldier was totally out of character. Batman and Alfred were constantly in utter awe of the Grail, a side of them that did not work for me. I generally think it is best to keep religion out of comics.The artwork was also very poor, especially the depictions of the villians. You would never guess who was who from the artwork because the characters were drawn so different from usual.Lastly, there was very little story or plot. Most pages were graphic heavy and story light, so for a book this size there was very little going on. And the story presented did not work in many areas. Ras changed his objectives 180 degrees based on one flippant remark from his daughter - very out of character.There are better Batman books out there.
5153	Can remakes be unmade?: No-talent actors and director destroying an otherwise heartwarming story. Typical example of comtemporay Hollywood ego's assuming more importance than the story itself.The original plot has been so mutilated, that halfway through the movie the purpose of the angel's visit is made pointless.Do yourself a favor, spend your valuable time watching the original classic instead of this colossal waste of celluloid.
5154	Hour and Minute Hands Work Great!: Seemed like a very nice clock when it arrived. Easy to set up. Unfortunatly the second hand quit working after about a week.
5155	Equally Scared!: I have the first edition and that also says that George Bush is a Gemini. I was going to buy the new version (as it is no longer current and so I can't do new birth charts completely), but what if there is more wrong than just the Bush thing?Other than this mistake, that I was unaware of until now, I found the old version very helpful. I find that it covers enough information to get what I want. It is, perhaps a beginners book. I can't figure out from this book, however, how to get what planet in what sign properly. I find discrepancies between internet charts and the book, so I tend to get the planet/sign chart online and then do the houses, rising sign, etc. from the book. The first book doesn't come with a CD and I always thought that would be a great addition.
5156	marcus welby I: Quality product -- ie sturdy case, nice episode guide with photos, each disc has its own compartment. Crisp & clear footage -- inspirational and interesting shows -- very enjoyable.
5157	Urrrrrrrrrrgggghhh: This was probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The sight of the box just depresses me. It has almost talked me out of joining the Army.It may be the most realistic Vietnam movie, but the focus of the movie is on all the negative aspects. The troops are a bunch of poor white guys and minorities who are sacrificing their lives to capture a worthless hill, only so the hippies and college kids at home who are too afraid to fight (under the guise of saying it's 'immoral') can spit on them when they return. They deal with racial tensions and friendly fire. What makes it even more senseless is that you never really bond with the characters except to feel sorry for them, partly because you can hardly hear what they're saying. The whole experience of the movie is just depressing. Maybe that was the point.If you're into war movies, this is worth looking into, but otherwise no way.
5158	John, How Could You?: Where was the hero? Who should I have been rooting for? What happened to the escapee? Was the world really in that much danger, or did Maynard have another agenda? Why would Lake do that? Why would two legitimate judges tolerate and work with a local yokel justice of the peace? Those are just a few of my questions, and none of them were answered. Compared to where started, with The Firm and A Time to Kill, we have lost touch and I don't really know what John is thinking anymore. Maybe the well has run dry.
5159	First Book Winner: Terri Kirby Erickson's first book is rich in metaphors and diverse in subject matter. Her love of language and poetry is evident in each of her spirited and original poems. The poem "Luncheon in Paris" was my favorite and well worth the price of the book. The book is beautiful both inside and out. The cover art is spectacular.
5160	The Most Brilliant Movie: My sister and her friends were watching this. It was really funny. The best part was the "straight is great" camp. Those people were only there because other people thought they were gay--not because they necessarily were. Those people thought they were gay because they were stereotypes. It kind of reminded me of school. How everyone judges other people. I think this movie did an awesome job at making people see how stupid judging people is.
5161	Good CD: Very good CD. A must for third eye blind fans. Not as good as Blue, but still catchy and energized. Overall worth the purchase.
5162	firebreak {The Warbirds}: This and Richard's other books ale all grab you by the pants (just can't put it down} type of books. But it would be in the best intrest of the readers if you would put all of Rickard Hermans book in Kindle format. To put it straight foreward, The series was the best I've read in along time. Please keep'em coming...
5163	All are re-records and several are pretty good.: A box 3 CD cases and only 10 songs per(30 total). Not a good start then read: Contains new stereo records by the featured artists.I'm not against this stuff (re-records) but only if I know what I'm getting before I buy.That's not the case here. Some of the tracks are pretty good and bunches are completely forgettable. Some of the singers have voices that are completely changed, for others somebody else in the group sang here.Even at the reduced price, this isn't a keeper.Save your money...
5164	SAVE YOUR MONEY PEOPLE,: What happening to THE PEOPLE WHO EDITED AND COMPILED THIS JOKE OF A DVD!!!!!!!. What up? , this is A VERY UNWATCHABLE video. The interview segments are interesting, but WHY aren't the VIDEO'S SHOWN in thier FULL LENGTH. They put the inteview at the middle of each concert's video (tell me why why?).This is a DVD that I bought, watched once and wasted. SAVE YOUR MONEY please; someone else will buy it and probably be severly dissapointed like.
5165	Not like I remembered...: I had one of these as a child, I remember having so much fun on it. I decided to get my child one so he could experience the same. The toy I remembered moved forward when you bounced on it, as you bounced it also made a noise that I can only describe as 'a playing card in the bicycle spokes' sound.This toy does not move forward, nor does it make sounds. Up and down are the only things it contributes to playtime. My 18 month old likes it every now and then to bounce on, but other than that he still prefers the push truck, complete with noise for $[...] at Wal-Mart.
5166	Chansons de La Belle Epoque: This genre of music is so very inspiring but this is the worst quality CD I have ever heard in my life. How do I return it for a refund ?
5167	I Got What I Paid For!: I LOVE Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburn in What's love Got To Do With It. THIS MOVIE IS THE BOMB.COM/.ORG/.NET!!!!! Bada ba ba ba I'm Lovin' It!!!!!!
5168	The Canadian Brass are so much better than this...: Some music ages well. This album has not. It sounds like a collection of cheesy 1980's TV theme songs. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with the musicianship of the Canadian Brass. Unfortunately, the arrangements are extremely dated, filled with strange synthesizer sounds and silly techno beats. The Canadian Brass are at their best when they're playing great classical and jazz music like no other ensemble in the world. This offering feels rather pedestrian for their immense talents. Though there might be a hint of quirky charm for some, I'm hard pressed to recommend this album to anyone except the most die-hard of Canadian Brass fans who might want to complete their collection. Otherwise, listen to their other recordings first.
5169	Choking hazard: Like all Melissa and Doug toys, this is beautiful and well-made. My 13-month old son loves stacking and shape sorting, and plays all the time with the Fisher-Price plastic version of this. He received this as a birthday gift and we were really excited......until he promptly popped the top blue ring into his mouth and started zooming around the house. I don't think it is big enough to swallow ordinarily, but if he were to fall I think it could become lodged in his throat and would be very hard to grasp to remove as the edges are all very smooth. We tried just taking that ring out of the set and putting it up, but then he did the same thing with the top red ball so we have put the whole toy away. Bummer.
5170	over-rate me: Imagine if your career was based around a myth of "keeping it real" by doing something that was done to death before. If Patsy Cline could get away with skanky clothes and brag about picking up guys by asking them to massage her southern regions, well, there would be no need for boring Neko to exist - if Shania is Britney then Neko must be Christina, long live mediocrity.
5171	Watch Out!: These handwraps are very short. 108" is not the ideal length and I was very unhappy to find this out. I would suggest a much longer handwrap. Especially if you're a beginner, like myself, you need much longer handwraps for the support because longer handwraps allow you to have cross-finger support as well as the much needed wrist support. DON'T BUY. GET LONGER HANDWRAPS!!
5172	great for large dogs: I bought this for my Mom ... Her Standard Poodle is 85 pds. and VERY long. I have had trouble finding a product that would fit , we were even considering fashioning something from a plastic tablecloth,but this is perfect.He wont wear the hood of coarse but the rest he tolerates and can even bound about in. Shipping was fast too ...
5173	Stop Buying this for Pregnant Women Already!: Wish I could give it 0 stars! This book is so full of worst case scenarios, that it will drive a pregnant woman insane!I read through parts of a friend's copy of this book before I got pregnant, and thought "Now THAT's a great form of birth control!" Then when I did get pregnant, I got two copies as gifts... UGH! 99% of the things described in this book don't happen to every woman while pregnant. It's NOT normal to be constipated for nine months straight!This worst-case scenario pregnancy guide is more like a worst-ever pregnancy gift. Save the woman some headaches! When you're pregnant, you are worried enough, without the terror this book can induce! It's a sure fire way to freak a woman out during a normal time in her life.PLEASE Stop Buying this for Pregnant Women Already!
5174	awesome hair rolls!!!: I give 5 star to this rollers, cause they the only one faster, easy, no pain to create curl in minuets!!!!! no more hot iron or Curlers Magic Leverag
5175	Would do it again.: Built my entire kitchen and used these hinges for every door. They're easy to install, have plenty of adjustment, and are holding up well after 5 years. Would recommend these without hesitation.
5176	SUZY AMIS-PLEASE STOP ACTING: okay. Just caught this on TV1 tonight. First off, there is some above average script writing for a low budget film, and the gun effects are nice as well. Some of the characters are interesting, but the plot is a bit hokey (gangstas and asteroids?), and Suzy Amis appears to be recovering from a hang over. Totally uninspired performance, her lines are delivered as if she were rehearsing rather than actually "acting". Better casting and better direction needed. The Coolio death scene is about as uninspired as has ever been put on film. I kept yelling at the screen "Hey, Mister Director, were's the passion!". In fact, this film's biggest flaw is the flaw most grade B films have: A director who does not force his actors to display a sense of urgency. When Suzy is told the world is going to end, her reaction is similar to being told you forgot your change at the convenience store. ACTING!!!
5177	100% satisfied: Good price. The best part of this iron is that it goes off automatically so that I do not have to unplug, which was necessary with my previous one. It heats up quickly.
5178	Not lost yet: I bought these glasses for my boyfriend who is always losing reading glasses.He has used these for 10 months and he just loves them. He does not set them down too often since they hang around his neck. The magnet is still strong and they are such a conversation piece in public when he breaks his glasses in half. It is also difficult to find glasses that fit his head but these expand to a larger size so they fit perfect.
5179	Looking for a replacement: Pretty easy to set up and use, but it stalls half the time. I generally prefer to watch movies WITHOUT it locking up every 5-10 minutes. I'm definitely looking for a new DVD player. I don't recommend the P241 to anyone.
5180	I still haven't received it.: Its been over a month and I still have not received my item. Apparently it was lost in the mail. I am very unhappy about this. I will never use amazon again.
5181	Instant Classic: Fell in love with this movie the first time i watched it. The humor, the story, the scenery, all spark the imagination and bring back the kid in us. And inspire a whole new generation of Santa fans.....
5182	Pretty disapointed: These weights are definitely made for men (I hope that there aren't any women with ankles bigger than mine!!). I know that I am of slender build, but these weights wrap all the way around until the spiky Velcro attaches itself to the "wet suit" material. This makes the soft Velcro part useless. So unless you have ankles that are the size of a large horse I would look elsewhere. Although with them strapped up tight they do their job!
5183	Captivating and a must read!!!!: From a desserted island, Old fashion America, and the magical lands of Lanconia, J.T. and Aria set the pages of this book on fire. With a stubborn tug-a-war of wills you will undoubtedly fall in love with the beautiful characters of this book.
5184	if only he'd written more!: This book might have been subtitled, "Retranslating Freud," because that's just what the author does with some of Freud's key terms.I was gratified to see that "cathexis" could actually be rendered "charge" or "investment": much more consistent with how Freud uses the term. Freud was certainly a reductionist, but mistranslations of his work make him seem absolutely bloodless.This is one of the best books on Freud I've ever read.
5185	looking for metal band victory- cultured killed the native: looking for metal band victory- cultured killed the native is it the same band .there is no reviews or list of song . hunting for the cd .is it the same cd.heared couple tracks love the cd. please inform me if this is the same cd. some of the songs should be- always the same, on the loose.want to buy but dont know if same.
5186	Great series but ....: Jacques Pepin is my favorite TV chef. His technique is amazing. These recipes are from all segments of his life and they are fairly uncomplicated. I believe this series is Pepin's finest in production style and quality. And the master chef is in great form.About the DVDs, these are good video transfers but it appears that the audio has been tampered with. The TV broadcast sound quality is very good but the DVD's have an annoying distortion. I don't why they did this but it's clearly intentional because the promo ads have good audio. Also this set is not complete. There should have been 26 shows in this set but two are missing. Why did they make that odd ball decision? There's no chance they will release a DVD of the missing shows.
5187	So it didn't actually happen. SO WHAT?: All right. I admit that Britney is not a born singer. I admit that her song is written purely to make money. I admit that her bug-eyed look can be annoying. SO WHAT? I like the song, it's catchy and I like hearing it. OK? All you people who keep saying you shouldn't like songs because they are too manufactured, read my lips. I LIKE HEARING THE SONG. When I buy music, it is because I want a copy to play at home, not to make some point about who deserves to be successful.
5188	buy it: Sturdy, easy to handle tomato corer. Red color makes it east to find in drawer and hard to lose. My wife was very pleased - it is better than the old one we had.
5189	Too good to be true: I just don't get it. This book reads like a cheerleading exercise, not as a serious work of journalism. It helped me answer the question I had before I read the book: Why would any venture firm allow a reporter to enter its inner sanctum? Answer: Only when it probably knows ahead of time that the outcome will be positive.
5190	Bocelli at his worst.: To say this was a wrong turn for Bocelli is an understatement. This record is a wreck from beginning to end. The music arrangements are sappy; Andrea's vocals are lifeless, especially when he sings in Spanish.Bocelli does not compare to Pavarotti or Domingo but he does have a nice voice. I hope he has the opportunity of using it in the future instead of falling for these empty commercial releases that no doubt will bring him a lot of money.Sad.
5191	Works well: This footrest works well, and the rotating action is a nice added bonus. I will be buying a second one for the other side of my desk soon.
5192	Rendering with mental ray not for non-programmers: The description of this book is totally misleading. It only discusses how to use mental ray through the running of scripts and programming language. It dicusses absolutely nothing as far as the manner in which mental ray is used in 3ds max. Does not explain mental ray through the use of traditional menus and the render dialogue box in 3ds max. No mention of what good settings are for GI values or lighting values. The entire book centers around entering information manually in script form rather than going through how mental ray works in 3ds max through the render dialogue box. The only reason this book gets 2 stars is that it does have a good glossary of terms. Of course, those terms can be retrieved from the standard 3ds max help menu. I am a very experienced 3ds max user and was simply looking to learn some more advanced features of mental ray, and I was extremely disappointed in the book, especially for $85.
5193	Great Toy!: I got this for my 7 year old daughter. She loves it! It is really building both her hand eye coordination, and her confidence. My 4 year old son loves to play with it too, and it stands up to his rougher style of play with no problem!
5194	Not what i thought it would be: Wussified the 80s hair band scene . I thought it sucked. Couldnt even finish watching it. Better luck next t
5195	Horse Behavior Book: Great Book. I have learned a lot. Very informative and a must for anyone who loves being around horses! So glad I bought it!!!
5196	Not what I expected: The hype for this game was misleading - the gameplay has nothing to do with rioting, revolution, or anything that requires creativity. You can't interact with the environment. You can do 3 things: break windows, kill people, blow up cars. The missions are repetitive, go get something and bring it back. You can't enter the buildings or cars. The worlds are small and not interesting. It's just a lame button masher where you hit or kick tons of enemies until they're dead. The graphics are OK.
5197	Too long and tedious: This book was much too long and included excrutiatingly detailed treatments of the politics of the law enforcement agencies involved. It was very tedious and I found myself skipping over paragraphs to find interesting material. This book is more of a treatment of how agencies and personalities work to solve murder cases than it is a gripping treatment of the murders themselves. I would have to say that the book is actually rather boring. Don't let me have too much influence over you, as it is clear that many other reviewers loved the book.
5198	too light-weight: I love this product in the fleece, but this is so light-weight. It defeats the purpose.
5199	Grail Quest Eventually Grates: This story began with great promise. It appeared to be a non-stop type of novel. About midway, however, it became clear that the author had a personal agenda to pitch. When the plot ultimately degraded into a "car chase" I actually put it away for a month or so. I finally finished reading the book this morning, and the ending is clearly designed for a B-Rated Hollywood film (Hmmm, maybe Richard Gere could play the lead role.) This book went from great to a grating disappointment!
5200	Not too bad: There are plenty of worse psychology books around (Lord knows), and this one does offer some genuine insights - in particular, the fact that if a relationship is troubled, just talking about it can only make it worse. However, the book also offers its share of stupid ideas and bad advice. For example: "When a woman shames a man, she's wrong even if she's right. When a man stimulates a woman's fear, he's wrong even if he's right." (There's more where that came from.) The book is a mix of valid information and sheer nonsense-which is average for its type. It can be useful if your relationship needs work, but there are a lot more interesting things to waste your money on.
5201	Just the right size: Looked around locally and couldn't find this size. Works well, right size. I'm happy.
5202	Too incredible to be true.....: From reading the reviews here, I thought WOW! Maybe I'll find comfort here. I lost a daughter to suicide in March 2007, so I've been desperate for answers and I do believe in life after death....but this book is just too much of a good thing. Within 3 months of losing her son, the author claims to have had 50 or more 'communications and signs' from her son. Not only her and her husband, but most of his ex girlfriends, and even strangers keep getting signs from her son. She is constantly getting phone calls from people, son's friends and ex girlfriends, etc. saying they recieved a 'sign' from her son. And I've only read 65 pages of the book! Way, way over the top.....too many 'signs from beyond' to be true.
5203	Disappointed: fuhgettaboutit. The best vintage Poundstone-Rudner-Tenuta-Degeneres tape is still the "Women of the Night" one (which seems to be out of print here, but I still see it in video stores). The one I would love to see on video is Paula at Harvard for the Hasty Pudding performance -- distributors, where are you?
5204	Not working: I sent a message three days ago never heard back I want my money back really bad because I'm not able to use it and I didn't just spend like 12 bucks for nothing
5205	Movado: I am very satisfied with the product, the fact that Amazon shipped it to an FPO address is great, one thing that I'm not sure about is that the product did not come with the traditional Movado card, unsure if it's no longer issued with purchase or because I purchased it on line? The watch is beautiful.
5206	Cookware for life: Love it, love it, love it. After much research, I picked this set of cookware, and I do love it. Some of the other reviewers were right about a few things...my handles can get hot if I'm not careful and the pans are more difficult to clean to keep that bright shine. But it's still fabulous stuff. I wish I had more cupboard space because they are getting scratches from being stacked so tight in my cupboard. But that's life. Love the pans though. I'll have them forever.
5207	Disappointed: I installed two of these in beach bike wheels. While pumping one of them up to set the bead, the tube blew out at only about 20 or 30 PSI. It blew near the stem. Examining the rubber around the hole, I found that the rubber was much thinner there than the rest of the tube. I was in a hurry, so didn't fool with returning to Amazon. A trip to Walmart solved my problem and was able to get riding that day. I just hope the other tube lasts the summer. I won't purchase these again due to the quality.
5208	It's not bad: I haven't listened to the whole c.d, only the clips shown here on Amazon. But I have listened to "These are The Days" and "From The Damage", and I really love both of those songs. I think O-Town has grown a lot since their last album. I did enjoy their last album, but it was too "boy-bandish". They've really grown since then, and it's refreshing to see a band that can grow musically and come out the better for it. The only problem I have with this album is their knock-off of "Careless Whisper" by Wham, in their song "I Only Dance With You". That was a good song, and no offense, but their version of it (or whatever that is) is not so good.
5209	dullest razor I've ever purchased: This is by far the worst shaver I've ever purchased in over 40 years of shaving. If you have a beard that's any fuller or coarser then a 15 year old's peach fuzz, then this razor can't handle it. I actually thought that maybe there was some kind of packing film left over the blades the first time I used it but no, its just a bad, dull razor.
5210	beautiful: A wonderful album. I keep playing it again and again. It is music that goes straight to the heart. I am glad and thankful that it was not colored in western pop. The previous positive reviews were so much to the point, I find it difficult to add anything meaningful. If Africa attracts you, so will this album.
5211	The coolest pepper grinder in history!: You get salt and pepper in one grinder! How cool is this! Just squeeze the handles and you can grind your pepper or salt WHILE YOU'RE STIRRING THE POT! Easy to adjust the grind and refill. Love it.
5212	Tenderness: Tenderness was a wonderful book. The only thing I had a problem with this book was the ending, but you'll find out about it yourself and you might disagree. It was a two-sided story, one side being a girl running away from home looking for a boy she met long ago that was just released from juvenile hall, and the boy she met who was sent to jail for the brutal murder of supposed "abusive parents who tortured him for years". What the cops, (all except a smart detective), don't know is that he also sexually assaulted and murdered 3 or more girls on the side. When the runaway girl sneaks into his van he realizes that she could be a threat to him and decides to try and kill her.The book is so well written, it is almost as if you are there. Eric, the murderer, is actually a very likable character. It's the girl that will get on your nerves.
5213	a guilty pleasure: Brilliant. Well researched. Wickedly funny. The only problem with this book is that the people who could benefit from it the most -- i.e., people who get their news from Rush Limbaugh and Fox News -- will never read it.
5214	Waste Of Time: As I watched the credits roll at the end of this movie, I sat there stunned! Wondering to myself when the movie was going to actually Start, Much less end? THIS MOVIE WON AN OSCAR? WHAT A JOKE! I Really like Morgan Freeman, his mere presence in the movie is the only reason I gave it 2 stars! This one can put you to sleep if your not carefull.
5215	Very Readable: Livingston does a masterful job of summarizing Christian thought in the west from Kant through Nietzsche. Each theologian is well summarized and located within the various movements of Christian thought. Many of today's religious issues have their antecedents in the 19th century: individual autonomy vs group solidarity, reason vs tradition, and the objective vs subjective aspects of reality.
5216	Bogus Recording: This CD is NOT Starbuck. It consists of home demos, practice tapes and unfinished songs recorded by Bruce Blackman. Most of these songs were never recorded by Starbuck and since they are home demos, the quality is very bad. I was the lead singer, songwriter and prducer with Starbuck and please don't waste your money. This CD should not even be on the market.
5217	Camera needs rethinking, not a good product.: I bought this camera to take footage and pictures of my new little girl. I heard Canon was supposed to have the best picture quality. When I got the camera the image was terrible and choppy while the camera was panning across the room. Very grainy and unsmooth. It's supposed to have night vision, but it's still too dark. The sound quality was horrible, it records the sounds of the motor inside running, that's all you hear in a quiet room.
5218	Not their best, but darn good: Kerplunk is not Green Day's best album. Dookie, Insomniac, and Nimrod are all-in-all better, but Kerplunk has its own feel and style, and is well worth listening to.
5219	I need to see this live!: I bought this yesterday and just finished seeing it. It's great. I knew precious little about the songs or exactly what I was going to see when I pushed "play" on my dvd player. I don't need to tell about the story, the reviewer before me does a very good job doing so. This is a very well thought out production and implementation of the story of Jesus in modern day NYC. Superb choreography. Here's the problem though: as a play, it was meant to be seen live, not on dvd. I enjoyed the dvd but it only made me wish the entire time I was watching it that I was in the audience.Oh, well. I suppose this dvd is the next best thing-and it was pretty good. I guess I've got to get the cd now and learn he songs.Michael Tait was incredible, as I expected him to be. A surprise here: I'm not the biggest fan of Rebecca St. James but I am now. She was very good in the play. T-Bone-I have to find out what he sounds like on one of his cds now.Excellent. Live: way,way excellent I'm sure.
5220	Great Movie Without Going Overboard: I was really pleased with Knowing. The first half was really interesting, and the characters are not only believable, but we can understand their pain and how they live. From the aha moment the code is revealed, we are thrust into wondering what will happen on the predicted day. I know some people were wanting to see more accidents and predictions, but I think there was a limited amount of time available to do so, and the movie gave just enough to verify the future was known. I won't go into too many details to spoil it for you, but I thought the end of the movie was really good. If you like science fiction movies regarding the end of times, etc... then you will enjoy the movie.Bottom Line: I was happy with the film, it was a bit longer than many, but wasn't boring at all. The ending was a bit of a surprise, but in a good way. So, if you enjoy Science Fiction or Suspense, Knowing is worth watching.
5221	Helpful: As someone new to bead making, I read this book first and it clearly explains the tools and processes. After reading it, I was able to tackle this new skill with ease. It also features beautiful design illustrations.
5222	glamour slippers: i purchased your slippers with a gift certificate i got - unfortunately they are NOT TRUE TO SIZE - and they had to be returnedand i therefore was charged for the postage on said purchase which i dont think was fair - i have worn this product before and had no problem - so it makes me wonder WHY these didnt fit
5223	Great little knives: Small in size and simple one hand operation, I have given several of these to friends and family for presents...Always a hit!
5224	It does the job: Easy to set. Just put some peanut butter on it and you will catch one from time to time. I just got to remember to place it in a place my cat can't get to.
5225	wrong: i order gummy BEARS not gummy WORMS!! very upset they sent me the wrong thing. i had a themed party of gummy bears and the worms threw it all off. i was very disappointed. and on top of that they came late!!
5226	good movie: very good movie, has a creepy twist to it. it looks brand new and plays great and was a very good price, advise anyone to buy from them , thanks
5227	Now I understand web services, .NET, SOAP, ...: I've been hearing about SOAP and XML-RPC and .NET and interop and web services for months now, but I didn't *really* know what any of it was. Now I do. This book is GREAT! Simple, down-to-earth, intelligent coverage of SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, XML-RPC, web services, .NET, competing technologies, and some more. Lots of code samples and complete explanation of the code. It focuses on what precisely SOAP is, how it works, where and when to use it.I read Livingston's Essential XML book, and I hoped this book would be as good. It is. As Homer Simpson says, Nine thumbs up (the one where he was a food critic)!
5228	A book for the time we live in......: Its rare I ever read fiction, but when this was sent to me I set it aside and then one night I started reading it while in bed and I was hooked.Perhaps because we are in a time when so many people are losing their homes, getting hours cut back at work, dealing with the stress of everyday life, or as in my case, dealing with the death of my husband.This is why I will recommend the book to anyone, especially men who are dealing with job issues, home issues, housing concerns and thinking they have no where to turn.The author does an excellent job of using a story to show how in the darkest hour when we think we are lost for good and things seem to be getting worse no matter how hard we try, that help does arrive.Lives are healed and made whole. And we can have a better life.
5229	Not a toy: Why is this lantern in the toy category? It's no toy. I haven't filled it up or lit it yet but it looks well made. Made in China.
5230	A bit dated...needs to be updated: I enjoyed the "what not to wear" parts of the book. Although I found it to be incredibly dated. In order to be elegant she has you changing your clothes 5 to 6 times a day. Different outfits for 9,1,3,6,7,8 and 10 p.m. And stocking with seams...hmmmm Do they still sell these? There is some good advice but this book truly needs an update plus if you are not a city dweller spending weekends in the country a lot of this book will not be for you.
5231	Not useful as a Buyer's Guide. Save your time and money.: I found this book worthless in helping me select a used Porsche.
5232	Comprehensive but not in depth: This is a nice book for people who have the basic idea of ASP.NET. This Book covers almost all topics for .Net2.0 . It is a very good reference book for newbie.Unfortunately, this book isn't in-depth for lots of topics, basically it just introduces most common cases, and you probably can't find what you want for some topics. (Eg implement Sorting and Pagation for ObjectDataSource, Crystal Report, memory management, ADO.NET in depth, .Net Virtual Machine etc). The source code is another down side for this book. Most of the code doesn't run, also the connection string wasn't right at the first place, I have to spend hours and hours to get it right.In conclusion, it worth to buy, if you just want learn asp.net in a fast way. It will give you the solution for most tasks. Pretty good reference book.
5233	Size is smaller than expected: I wish there was more information on the sizing for this item. I am a petite woman and I've been known to purchase boys clothing on occasion because the price difference can be quite significant. I purchased this item for my self and found that the shoulders were much narrower than any other boys shirts I've owned in the past. The narrow shoulders made the sleeves much to short for me and it almost became a 3/4 length shirt. Otherwise the material is awesome, the fleece on the inside is very warm and cozy. I love the smooth finish on the outside of this sweatshirt as well because it wouldn't attract cat/dog fur as badly as most fleece does.
5234	my libido is back!: I take meds for anxiety and depression. That pretty much depletes any sex drive and guarantees weight gain. I have more energy, better mood, libido is way up and a bit of a curbed appetite since taking l-tyrosine 500mg a day for a month. Go for it!
5235	The worst movie ever made!: This movie is disgusting, vile and even worse factually inaccurate. It is sick that anyone made money on this film and someone spent money on this film! The JEWS had nothing to do with the death of JC, it was clearly the Romans. The Passion Plays this movie is based on, caused the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent JEWS by inciting hatred over the last 2,000 years. Can we please get out of the Dark ages? Just if you were wondering, I am not Jewish.
5236	Avoid This: Signed up for cable internet and installed this product for protection on my WIN98SE machine. Install went fine but multiple fatal errors, freezes and shutdowns everyday since. Seems to be major conflicts with the Privacy Service component, especially when I try to run Musicmatch Jukebox. Crashes almost everytime unless I disable Privacy Service. Also, you have to log in everytime you restart your system and takes at least three times as long to load up when the system starts. I actually went ahead and bought a new computer and I plan on using Norton products on that system!
5237	Pumps you up so much, it'll give you a heart murmur!: W.A.S.P. is in top form again. The live version of Mean Man will blast you through the ceiling but cuts out right before the solo. More slow songs than Live Raw. Drums and bass are awesome. The sound is different enough from Live Raw to merit purchase.
5238	Bad iron: Iron arrived in good condition. To bad it wouldn't work. It wouldn't heat up enough to steam. Dripped water all over my ironing board cover. Sent it back. They didn't have anymore in stock so I have decided to get a different brand. One I have had very good luck with a Rowenta.
5239	Belt breaks and comes off every time I vacuum!: I bought this vacuum because of the cheap price and great reviews, but I got so frustrated this morning that I physically kicked it. Every single time I vacuum the belt either comes off or it breaks. Otherwise it worked fine, but I'm buying a different vacuum now!
5240	Be Careful!: I used to let my son play with this toy in his crib. One day after his nap, I went into his room and saw that he had ripped the squishy ball off the toy. It was laying on the floor next to his crib. I'm just thankful he didn't put it in his mouth. I have contacted the company and the CPSC about it.
5241	brief yet compelling: I'm currently reading the biography, 'Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy' by Eric Metaxas (a great read) and have enjoyed Bonhoeffer's writing for some time. I spotted this devotional title a few months ago and purchased it to use along with daily Bible reading. It is a wonderful book. It's perfect for those days that are so full of daily duties that they leave little room for reflective reading. Though each daily portion is short, the combination of insights from both authors is thought provoking and powerful. As another reviewer stated, I'm often amazed at how pertinent to certain situations in my life these readings have been. If you are a fan of Bonhoeffer and enjoy being able to read this type of devotional book, I highly recommend it. This will give you a desire to learn more about this gifted man, and to delve deeper into his wonderful writing.
5242	Teach yourself Yoruba with a headache: Being a European woman living with a Yoruba man, I wanted to learn some of his language and bought Teach Yourself Yoruba. Unfortunately, I found that this booklet makes things extremely complicated. Although it is precise and correct, it starts with the first 6 chapters only dealing with the different tones. The examples that are given are probably useful when learning tones, but desastrous when you want to build some kind of vocabulary or practise making sentences. You have to be quite persistent to make it to chapter 7 ('Greetings' - e.g. good morning, good afternoon), let alone chapter 20 ('Numerals' - e.g. one, two, three, four, five).I've learned many languages in my life (6 European languages, Chinese, Japanese, Swahili, Tibetan etc.), and although in most of them I never gained any fluency, I know from experience that this is not a good way to learn a language.
5243	Kay Scarpetta stumbles: A 200 page story in a 415 page book. Enough with Lucy and her love life! Get back to science and medicine, elements that made the previous books so enjoyable. Please give us more than a 1 page climax in the next book. Worth reading in paperback, definitely not worth the hardcover price.
5244	Bold new Scifi adventure series: Donald Thompson grabs you by the lapels on the very first page and he doesn't let you go until it is over with - on the very last page. Who is this guy and where has he been? I want more!
5245	Onward through Westeros: I'm hooked on the books. The show is nice to offer up the imagery, but the scale described in the books is immense and the thoughts of the characters provides detailed insights.
5246	Not What I Ordered (not even close): I ordered a 0-60 psi gauge (the gauge I received was 0-100 psi) with a bleeder valve (the gauge I received has no bleeder valve) and a straight chuck (the gauge I received has an angled chuck). Totally unacceptable.
5247	try another: I was really disappointed...I am considering getting a real cash register to use with my 8 year old. He liked the idea but this machine is not only annoying, the draw pop out too fast, it froze its a computer ), it scans anything, cute but Ive never heard of a pencil that costs $16.05..anyhow... back to the drawing board!$40 is too much for this toy...
5248	cheap leather cheap wallet: even though this wallet has an okay design and thefunctionality of this wallet is acceptable thiswallet has a huge major design flaw: it is madefrom cheap materials.even though hobo is supposed to some sort of companythat supposedly specializes in high quality leatherand hardware i found that this was not the case withthis hobo lauren wallet. the metal started to peeloff, the leather has already started to shed, andone of the inner pockets has ripped a little bit,i've only had it for 3 weeks!i am going to try to figure out how i can send thisone back....
5249	Nice and sturdy: I have received but not traveled with it yet but taking it across Thailand later this month. Looks really nice and well built. A little heavy but i like the option of backpack or roller.
5250	Great Seat Post!: I was very happy when I got this seat post in the mail!! It looks great on my bike the only problem was that is was about 2 inches too long. I got it cut at a local bike shop and it now fits.
5251	A Comprehensive Guide? Not exactly: If I am reading a book about how to overcome shyness and the physical symptoms I would have expected it to teach you such exercises. The majority of this book tells you why you are shy and that it is not a bad thing you should pretty much just accept it and get over it. If you want to know why you are shy and what may or may not have happened to you in the past to make you more susecptable then read this book. If you want to know steps or practices to avoid while raising your child to prevent them from becoming shy then read this book.
5252	Very disappointed - old software with defects: This is NOT the 6th level of MarJongg Master. We have MarJongg Master 2 which is excellent and I was hoping to get a new and upgraded version of that software.MahJongg Master 6 is old and limited code with bugs. In addition, even simple things like being able to minimize the software or pause a game does not exist. It also will only work on full screen.Then, if you move your cursor too far too the edge, the whole game moves partially off the screen... very annoying.
5253	Disposable product: I first saw this product on the Target clearance page and did a little shopping. As mentioned, the software is easy to install and uninstall. Do not expect any customer service support if you buy this product because KB Gear Interactices phones have been turned off and apparently the company is no longer.
5254	Word.: The movie is about this midget who likes to yell alot. He eventually marries a crank whore, and then since he's such a douche, he pisses this terminator wannabe off, and that guy blows him away.
5255	Be careful - little fingers will get hurt in this toy!: My son loves the Baby Einstein video tapes, so we had to show him this toy when we saw it at the store. He was delighted in playing with it for about 5-10 minutes when suddenly his little finger got stuck in one of the holes (where the characters pop up and down). He screamed and could not get his finger out. I had trouble getting his finger out also because the character was wedged against his finger. This toy is not safe. It should be redesigned.
5256	not for big babies: My son was 9lbs 11.2oz at birth an 22inches long. This tub is NOT for big babies, he's only 5 months and has out grown it already.There's no way this tub can convert to an toddler tub,evey time my son sit's up, he end's up squishing him self on the plastic part in the middle. I was givn this tub as a shower gift and now im wishing I had returned it and gotten something else.
5257	THIS IS GOOD: THIS IS A GOOD CD. WARDA IS UP BEAT.THERE ARE A COUPLE OF REALLY GOOD SONGS,I FIND IT HARD TO KEEP STILL WHEN I HERE THEM.THERE IS NOT ALOT OF WAILING.SHE HAS SOFTEND HER VOICE TO BLEND PERFECT WITH THE MUSIC.
5258	love this book, but confused: I Love this book, but ? Is aphrodite the daughter of zeus or a blood relative? Because if not the is no way in hell should julian be able to hold the sword of cronus.Cronus was zeus's father, which makes artemis his aunt and not his cousin as julian calls her in kyrian's book
5259	Deceptive...: This Home Dock is exactly that... *Just a Dock!* If you buy this please keep in mind that you will need to buy the Radio Tuner separately. All in all it was very expensive to buy both of these items! I could have probably just bought a whole new radio for the cost. Then, add to that the huge expense of having 2 radios activated with XM (They give a *very* paltry discount for activating another radio). VERY expensive. I do like the fact that I can now listen to XM radio through my XM ready Yamaha receiver... but, other than that, I would not purchase these items again.
5260	children's rubber gloves: It was very difficult to find rubber gloves in children's size. Amazon had them! I have bought 2 boxes of 100. My 5-year old niece uses them for crafts and when she helps with housework. Very cute! I recommend these colorful gloves.
5261	Don't Believe the Hype.: This book is completely worthless. Short on specific tactics and long on glib anticdotes, I found no value at all to this "classic". What a bummer.
5262	Incredibly great product: Having recently discovered how comfortable thong underwear can be, went on a mission to find the best thong available. Thinking that the more expensive the better, wasted a ton of money on high-end designer thong underwear. This is the best one on the market, and you cannot beat the price. Just pulling a pair out of the box, visuallu they look increidbly comfortable. They are a bit snug on the package, but you kind of want that, as your bits and pieces can slip out with other thongs I have tried. I am devoutly loyal to this product, just wish for a wider variety of colors and patterns
5263	Good product Good price: Great tea tree oil! I use it for all sorts of things but mostly acne and acne scars. Doesn't leave your skin feeling oily. Pretty strong scent, but can be diluted with other oils if necessary. Overall great product and I will reorder.
5264	A Sure Fire Winner!: Cloud Nine was by far one of the most touching stories I have read in years! It was modern and it touched on all the issues that families deal with everyday. The pain and anger of loss, the finding of new love, and renewal of the spirit.From the first page to the last Cloud Nine is everything you could possibly want in a book. Not only do you not want to put it down; you want to be part of the story. It touches your heart and soul.
5265	Cable-lifted storage rack: THE ROTOR LOOP METAL, WHERE IT HOOKS TO THE TURN SHAFT, WEARS OUT QUICKLY, THE MORE WAIT THE FASTER IT WEARS OUT. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL FAILURE FOR THE DURABILITY AND OPERATION OF THIS PRODUCT.ALTHOUGH IT'S RATED CAPACITY OF 250 LB THE COMPONENTS DO NOT SUPPORT DURABILITY. THIS PRODUCTS WOULD BE EXCELLENT FOR 75 LB.
5266	A Dog Man's Star: A Follow up to their sucesful and critical aclaim self titled debut is a fantastic album. A Dog Man's Star take a bit new direction but still has the unique vocal styles of Brett Anderson and the fantastic guitar playing of Bernard Butler. The songwriting is a lot better and now they are more focused on what they're doing. On this album there are quite a few gems on it and I Have to recomend any music fan to get this album. it is raw,beautiful,soulful yet dark and mysterious. Suede managed to create another masterpiece with A Dog Man Star which becomes their most mature and ambitios work to date.
5267	Much ado about nothing: The writer has an enormous list of the various names of the legendary gods at his command, using it without much explained commonality I found this bewildering, boring and tedious. I did not finish reading the book.
5268	Very Good Product: This was a replacement nailer for a Craftsman that just wore out. It performs as expected - nothing more and nothing less. Worth the price. I recommend it.
5269	Scott Sullivan would enjoy: This is Bill's celestial yet mundane depiction of pragmatism. The note structures cling only to residual "wool" or influx. Scott Sullivan would become deeply addicted to this one. However, I contemplate Bill's concept of ordinary language which is structured to follow the logical development of one idea.
5270	Hilarious!!: This was so much better than I thought it would be!! It's worth buying and I recommend it to anybody
5271	An irresistable invitation to re-evaluate punk's origins.: Originally issued as "SPunk", a legitimate release that claimed to be a bootleg, "The Mini Album" is alternative versions of Pistols classics. While the performances may be perferable to some, the sheen of "Never Mind The Bullocks" is left off. This leaves the Sex Pistols exposed as they really were: an incredible, experimental rock band. Progrockers like Yes tend to be credited with widening Rock's boundries; the Pistols ignored the limits entirely. It sounds as though it never even occured to them that they would be changing rock and roll forever.
5272	Everything's here...: Every possible detailed aspect I ever wanted to know about pasta making. Receipes are wonderful, copious and unique. The linguine with asparagus, mushrooms and caramelized shallots was healthy, satisfying and so tasty. I made homemade noodles with my new pasta maker instead of the linguine though. What a treat and a great value!
5273	Wonderful watch. Looks great and keeps time like a charm: Stylish yet affordable is the key. Looks classy and is supe reliable. Had a Seiko kinetic watch before and this is it's replacement after I brike the other one.
5274	terrible, just terrible: I bought this CD player - twice - and both times it was broken. The LCD lit up, but nothing appeared on screen, and I had to keep holding the dang play button to get it to do anything! Of course, that doesn't mean it played any music whatsoever! All I could hear was a faint buzzing noise. I called the company, and Virgin Pulse said Target had a hold of a "bad batch", so I guess I shouldn't blame Virgin Pulse entirely, but I'm still not buying from them again.
5275	The Art of Manipulation: This book is a cleverly repackaged version of "The Closers" written many years ago by Ben Gay III. While there is some powerful sales technique in this book the book centers itself around manipulating a prospect into the buying decision and encourages the use of hi-pressure. A salesman may gain some great insights into sales but must guard against losing some of their ethical balance in the process.
5276	For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide when the Rainbow is Enuf: Very Prompt service. Pleased with purchase.. allowed me to read the book before movie hit the big screen. Will purchase from this seller in future.
5277	Ocean Surf Interruptus: You begin listening, and find the sound of the surf very relaxing. "Ah, this is really nice," you say to yourself as you begin nodding off. Suddenly you hear "AWK! SCREEYAWK!" It's the sound of screeching seagulls. You fast forward the CD until you find a section without the freaking seagulls. But just as you begin to relax, a fog horn speaks, "HO-O-O-WONK!" You sail the CD out the window like a frisbee -- unless, of course, you find the sound of gulls and foghorns -- uh, relaxing.
5278	Satie and Suzanne: Great art, great music: Satie and Suzanne is a must for any fan of Eric Satie. Combining the music of French composer Eric Satie with the artistic interpretation of Cirque du Soleil, it captures the essence of the man and his thoughts, while creating a strange, almost dreamlike world. Set in turn of the century France, Satie is forced to wait out a tremendous rain storm in a local pub. The fellow patrons are all Cirque performers, who interpret his music and writings (it is narrated via use of his memoirs) through their performances. If your a fan of classical music and Cirque, you would be hard pressed to go wrong in purchasing this video.
5279	Good Work Book: This is a good, well thought-out work book to accompany the main text. It was co-authored by my relative, so that is the main reason I wanted to purchase it.
5280	Awesome: This is such a awesome book. It does have some mature scenes but i would recommend this boom to a lot of people
5281	Doesn't break if you use filtered water: In addition to the water filter that is built into my refridgerator, there is also an inline filter on the water supply that runs to the refridgerator. Maybe that is why I've not have any problems with my Keurig that I bought at Costco a long time ago.
5282	and we wonder why this worls in such bad shape: I am a 23 year old U.S marine i read this book after reading the turnner diarys out of pure interest. I could not believe what i read whatever could make people think that this was the way to get rid of evil in the world have no clue what they are talking about.This book leaves you with many questions from a very troubled man. If anything i hope to god the world does not come to voilence like i read in this book.its peopel like him that make me worried about what this world is coming to.If anything this book proved that racisim is a stupid idea as well as white supremecy some of the greatist men and women that i work with are blacks a jews ...pease outsgt kathy fillips us
5283	Boring: If you are looking to learn ANYTHING about lapdancing or floor work.... this is NOT the dvd for you. First off... I want to say that this dvd did not play in my dvd player and it is a new dvd-rw player. I could only watch it on my computer. The sound was turned up as loud as it would go and I could barely hear what they were saying, even after I put on my headphones! It features 4 women who do alot of talking and very little showing. It teaches you how to take your shoes off... COME ON! Do we really need help with that? I have seen better dancing at a high school prom. The demo dancing is completely useless and boring and the women have no skills. I am really disappointed in this dvd... Especially since it is $28! What a waste of good money.
5284	Terrible produc: As all campers, I am in pursuit of products that take up less space, durable, and serve a practical need. This product was attractive for its' space saving feature.First use it leaked, that was fixed with duck tape. Second, you cant fill it past halfway or it easily tips over and spills. Third, it is impossible to clean and a residue remains after the first use. Spilling and residue attract bugs and raccoons and they don't mix well with camping. Second time I used it the original hole widened so this thing went into the trash. It is plastic, with plastic parts and I expected a short life span but this didn't even make one trip. Very poor product
5285	Terrible performance, static, can't hear other party: This was my first bluetooth headset for my Blackberry Pearl and I was very disappointed. Pairing was okay and device itself seems fine as far as fit and looks go. Performance matters the most though and in that area it faltered. I couldn't hear anyone else who was talking to me and that was with volume turned all the way up, only if you were in a library could you hear their voice. In a quite office you couldn't hear the other party. On top of that there was lots of static. So I've returned it and just ordered a BlueAnt and pray that it gives me acceptable performance.
5286	Part IV in the Thumb series: A very unfunny short and so far the worst in the series. There a few laughs, but not nearly enough to sustain watching the whole thing.The DVD includes: An ok commentary, mock behind-the-scenes footage and interviews, deleted scenes, storyboards, and trailers for all the Thumb films including the unreleased Frankenthumb and The Godthumb.This is the best DVD in the series for sheer number of extras, but the movie [is bad].
5287	Vapid, insultingly bad film: If I could give this a negative # of stars, I would. This film is so bad that it's not worth my time to write this. However, I do wish someone had warned me! Yes, it's packed full of stars who laughed all the way to the bank. Maybe this piece of crap was made to sock it to the company releasing it or something. Very, very, very bad.
5288	The Ninth Wonder of the World Writes a Book: Like Mick Foley and The Rock before her, Chyna has released a book telling about her life with an abnormal family and how she became involved in wrestling. While not being the masterpiece that Have A Nice Day was, Chyna's book is still very good, and is a must read for all of her fans.
5289	Too many defects: Ok. This game is cute and at times fun, but at the same time disappointing. There are defects in it. Several times on the fourth level I get stuck in between this blank wall, which by the way is not intended to be a part of the game. When the bug is on the dragonfly, he gets hung on him and the wall and you have to restart the level and go back to the beginning of the trail. This has happened more than once. I think the part where the feet stomp is a little too excessive-almost too hard. And this game is for kids? I'm an adult and it is hard for me. The challenge can be fun, but the defects and glitches-a bummer. I want my money back.....
5290	Cannot recommend - it stains my laptop screen: As a keyboard protector, it works fine.Unfortunately, the material seems to interact with the LCD display to leave marks.It has stained my screen with rectangles (one from each protected keycap).Water does not completely remove the marks on the screen - they appear to bepermanent.
5291	Not as useful as expected: Kind of abstract and while somewhat interesting, did not hold any information that I found to be truly useful or intriguing.
5292	Excellent DVD: I asked and received this DVD for my 3 year old daughter for her birthday. She absolutely loves it. She has picked up so many words and phrases. I hope there are plans to come out with more versions so that she can expand her Italian even more.
5293	ONE OF A KIND, IN THIS DAY & AGE: They just don't make musicians like Robert Randolph anymore. This CD is incredible, hasn't left the car for 6 weeks. It has quickly become my favorite in my collection. Robert Randolph brings back times of sheer, unadulterated pleasure when it comes to music. Phenomenally moving. I wish I had a greater vocabulary, the better to impart to you just how INCREDIBLE this cd is.....
5294	Not for me: Way too sad and depressing. Not entertaining at all. Can't believe that this movie has been rated as 4 stars. The first one was much better.Hopefully this is the end of the "Why did I get married" films.
5295	Why Oh Why Marky Mark?: I don't know how much money it cost to make this movie but I have to believe that 80% of the budget went to Mark Wahlberg to get him to sign on to act in this movie. Mark is a really good actor, bordering on great. Why he chose to act in this movie had to be for financial reasons. This movie was awful. Just awful. It would have been obvious it was a terribly weak story from just a read of the script so money had to be the reason Wahlberg would risk his reputation as an good up-and-coming actor to "star" in this boring "movie". It's not good enough for made-for-cable. It's not good enough for direct-to-video. It might be good enough for made-for-TV. I'm not gonna waste any more of my time writing about why this movie stunk up my living room. I wasted enough watching this piece of crap. Don't rent it and certainly don't buy it. If you are really curious, borrow it from the library. Make sure you have a good pillow nearby.
5296	I dont understand why any Pink Floyd fan could like The Wall: The Wall is absolutly the worst Pink Floyd album ever made. I love Pink Floyd and their music but when I bought The Wall is was deeply disappointed because the Wall doesn't sound like any of the good Pink Floyd albums such as Dark Side of the Moon, Atom Heart Mother, Wish You were Here, ect. Pink FLoyd didn't use very much musical talent in this Cd and the lyrics are disappointing (the mention of a wall is endless and boring). This doesn't sound anything like the Pink FLoyd in the sixties and sevendies, they sound like a stupid eighties band that has no musical talent. "Another Brick in the Wall", "Mother", "In the Flesh", are just some of the songs that sound horrible and rushed. If you want to buy a good Floyd Cd check out anything but the Wall and you will be happy you did!
5297	Great scholarship: Knight does a fantastic job exposing the sinister activity of freemasons. Freemasonry by design is a guild and secret. By its very nature it practices favoritism and deceit. It reminds me of a title from Al Hirt "The brotherhood of man (or how to get rich without really trying)." Freemasons constantly get caught in mischief and they rant and rave when you call them on it. Freemasons have no credibility. My only criticism is that Knight doesn't point out the masonic preoccupation of freemasonry with cabala. I suppose this is because Knight was a member of Rajneesh's group, which was gnostic to the core and borrowed heavily from cabala. Ironically, Rajneesh was a freemason. Knight was a little naive in this respect.
5298	Lip-sync Letdown: I was looking forward so much to enjoying the full first season of my favourite all-time sitcom only to be let down by the fact that in every episode the syncronisation is out. The actors lips are a beat ahead of the sound and it annoyed me so much I took it back and got a refund. As no-one else on this review thread has mentioned this I'm left wondering if I was just unlucky. It's not just this DVD where I've noticed the problem, it's also on my Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 1 disc although not quite as noticeable. Needless to say this explains my one star rating, otherwise it would be a definite five.
5299	Excellent purchase...: The Pimsleur Conversational Spanish Course is an awesome buy! It does exactly what it's advertised to do, and that is to teach a person that has no previous Spanish to be speaking "Conversational Spanish" fast & easy. I highly recommend it!
5300	I just can't follow it: I have had this product for 5 years. Every time I try and do something with it, I just can't. I find the instructions to be confusing the layout on top to be wanting and the learning curve to be incredibly difficult. I can never get it to do what I want. I can't find anything when I'm looking for it! I want to do a simple art nouveau panel for a kitchen cabinet and I can't figure out the simplest things like setting my margins. I really want to use it because there are so many features I like. I really think it's laid out poorly and I'm good with computers! This was the biggest waste of money for me.
5301	very good: i loved the music to the second x-men movie even more than the first, which was very good too. in response to max folkman, the song that was in the background when nightcrawler was in the white house is called "dies irae" and is part of mozart's requiem. i know this because i sang it in my chorus at about the same time the movie came out. :) well, enjoy!
5302	Bag will break in time: I purchased six of these for a boxing class. We only use the bags about one hour a week. Within the first year, three of the six bags broke. The bags "screw" into the base. The plastic part of the bag that screws in will snap and make the bag useless. The plastic used is simply not durable enough to hold up to strong punches. Being a procrastinator, I waited until after the warranty had expired to contact Century. They told me they were aware of the problem and could sell me a replacement part for $250 and $15 shipping. I purchased the bags for $249 each, so I didn't find this helpful at all. If the bags were more durable, I would purchase more, but until they fix the problem, I would not purchase another Wasemaster XXL.
5303	The unknown battery: I ordered this battery and another inexpensive battery to compare the performance of each battery. I was sent two of the other brand of battery with an apology from the supplier. The retail store that I purchased the batteries from said that they discontinued the Synergy brand because their customers said that it did not perform up to its claimed capacity. I have not used this battery myself, but I am passing the warning on to others. This is simply a rumor at this point so you may have to take a chance on it to make up your own mind.
5304	Masterpieces Poorly Recorded: This is some of Gloria Lynne's absolutely best work very poorly recorded on the Collectable label out of Pennsylvania. BEWARE! If it were not for Amazon's policy for not accepting return CD's opened, I would have delivered it to them by hand. This is a tragedy. The company even recorded some of these great songs off a scratchy LP, with no filtering whatsoever. Really low rent approach...
5305	Must-buy for any beginning AD&D player!: The player's guide is the ultimate source of information on how to play the best pen-&-paper RP{G in the world, Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&D for short). You can create characters from one of 4 different classes, and 8 different races. Equip yourself with the gear needed, master the spells if your're a wizard, and steal things, if you are so lucky, as a thief or rogue. In short, if you're thinking about playing, or know someone who is, buy the guide, and dive into the adventure of a lifetime!
5306	Love the look but the inside falls apart: I ordered the ivory, blue and pink albums for each of my children and I love the way they look. It took me a few weeks to get my photos printed to put in, and by that time the window to return these for a full refund had passed otherwise I would have. The plastic that holds the pictures falls off after a few uses causing the pictures to fall out. I'm going to have to try and discreetly glue the plastic back on and probably tape each picture in the album so they don't fall out. I'm disappointed because the look is exactly what I want....just bad quality. I would not buy this product again but try and find the same colors in a better quality product.
5307	As delicious as a crunchy granola bar on an autumn morning: I use this often to look up wetland and other plants when I'm in the field. Nicely illustrated . Good size for the fanny pack. Plastic cover.
5308	Not worth the price of a DVD: I thought this was ok for a rental but not for something i would spend 25.00 on. I was disapointed in all the whispering. I know it is a movie about secrets but you could barely understand them at times. Reminds me of Murder at 1600.
5309	Scary music: This is a creepy film although the acting is awful with the exception of Linnea Quigley. This is about a bunch a teens going to a Halloween party inside a possessed house by demons. The story is self explanatory,but definitely worth the look very creepy at times.
5310	Not Bad For An Action Flick: For an action release, this is very good. The action is intense and is driven by a plausible story, characters and animation. The plot holes and sometimes less than stellar writing will take audiences out of the element sometimes but overall there isn't a lot here to complain about. Despite how much I didn't care for the earlier release from this series, this release is surprisingly entertaining to watch. While it won't be something that I personally suggest to anyone who will listen, fans that are looking for a strong action release to spend an evening with would be well advised to keep their eyes open for this one.
5311	It's bad don't get it i made that mistake: This game is easy to get lost in, scary and has bad graphics.
5312	No show: I did try and order this book from internationalbooks. I waited and waited for the book to come. When I checked on the order several days later I was told "a computer error had occured and they did not have the book." Yes my money was refunded and I had to buy the book from someone else. Once I got my copy from the other seller I checked to see what some of the other prices were now and internationalbooks STILL had a copy up for sale. (But they don't have a copy, or do they?) I guess we will never know. Thanks but no thanks.
5313	The Lemon Song, Or KILLING FLOOR!!!!!: Great stuff for sure.Unlike The Rolling Stones, who gave credit when and where due, for songs that they covered, Led Zeppelin PLAGERIZED Whole Lotta Love; Real title: You need love. They also PLAGERIZED The Lemon Song; real title: Killing Floor.Jimmy Page is a GREAT guitarist, Robert Plant sounds like a girl.GREAT CD!
5314	It's "choke on your own breathe" kinda funny.: Amazing quality. 10/10 for video, and 10/10 for audio. Looked amazing on our new 55inch Vizio TV. Streamed the movie straight from an amazon app on the tv. Great comedy, would highly recommend to anyone who isn't afraid of a little language, and mature jokes.I also highly recommend his other shows and recordings. Louis CK is totally one of the best out there, and my personal favorite. Absolutely had to support him.
5315	The Mentalist: The Mentalist is one of my most favorite shows! I am completly in LOVE with Simon Baker! You gotta check it out!
5316	Mighta Been: This film could have been decent. As it is, it's not the worst out there. But it's full of many holes.Keep low expectations and it might be a mildly entertaining view.** Spoiler Below **My main question is why those truck drivers didn't just hit the brakes? That would have solved everything. Instead they just kept driving along while being harpooned. Things like that really bug me because any idiot could have put a better plot device in there and made it at least mildly realistic.Without that and a quite a few other problems this might have been a pretty decent film.
5317	Suck at Scrabble? Try Snatch!: I was in an Airport in Vermont waiting for 3 hours for my next flight home when I first played this game! It is perfect to carry around in your bag. IT's light, and tons of fun! It not only makes you think fast, you also have to have fast reflexes to snatch the word! Love this game! It can be played with lots of people or just two!
5318	Did not work for us: We have a 9 year old Doberman who has been on Proin since the age of 2 for leaky bladder. After changing to this organic product (we heard it was potentially harmful to stay on Proin) we noticed she not only had small leaks, but full bladder emptying while she slept. Was not at all helpful for her.
5319	Stunning: The Stevens sisters' shimmering harmonies are a crystal-clear Godsend to Music Row's Faiths and Shanias. This is East Tennessee bluegrass in it's purest, modern form, with lightning-fast picking, soft-as-rain brush percussion, from-the-heart harmonies which raise your hair as only siblings can do, and writing which includes jaw-dropping ballads alongside toe-tapping uptempo rockabilly-sounding gems. Don't miss this train.
5320	Would not start: I could not get it to start after the first time. Service center recommended that I return it and get a 2-cycle model instead. They said that the 2-cycle models have been far more reliable, and spare parts much cheaper.
5321	Excellent!: A great first hand account of a white man living among the Indians in the 1800s. The anectdotes seem real. Reminds me again that people are the same all over but that different circumstances bring out different aspects of our character. This is a down to earth account of life living with the Indians not a "Little Big Man" fantastical yarn.
5322	this case is annoying!!: this case is really tight ( for my pearl 8100) and bulky. I switched back to the original case i got with the phone. The material on the sides (rough PE) is abrasive enough that it leaves fine lines on the phone when you pull the phone in and out of this case. Don't be too dazzled by the leather on the front and back like the other users.
5323	helps for carpal; a little flaky: these definitely help for carpal. my problem--mouse clicking hurts the heck out of my wrist area.of course, these give you "carpal" type pain in your elbow area although not too bad.the main problem with these mice is they deteriorate typically after a year of use. things that happen:--the cursor will suddenly shift to the far left of the screen.--the mouse won't select correctly.--clicking on something doesn't click--it either just doesn't work or it will do something else.that said, these mice have been a HUGE help. you just have to replace them much more frequently than a regular mouse.
5324	new reformation: Mark Driscoll's work on living on the balance of syncretism/sectarianism is critical to the church as we struggle between moralism and 'selling out'. His work has had a profound impact on his church and church pastors across the country. This book is a must read whether you are an 'emerging' pastor or if you have been in the ministry for decades. I pray it is a wake up call to a radical but necessary place of tension.
5325	A Half Baked Cake: The best I can describe this book is as "A Half Baked Cake". However hard a cook might have tried to get the best ingridients, and the right temperature in the oven, the best techniques for baking...but if the time the cake is left in the oven is less than needed, what you get is a "Half Baked Cake",and this is exactly what this book is.The author wanted to get someting out qucik...so she quickly huddled up to get some information, and as it goes in the modern day media, thrown in some controversy, and chances are you may become a best seller...well this looks like a failed attempt to become a best seller.....its more a work for fiction than research, an academician or researcher is more honest and persistent in her approach...this is a failed attempt at gaining cheap popularity.Save yourself a few lattes and cappacinos...that would be a better you of your hard earned $$$...don't make this lazy author rich.
5326	Worth the wait: I can't get enough of this group since they reinvented themselves in 2000 as the epitome of acoustic/acid jazz.Jazzhole is simply one of the best bands extant. Their music is always TRULY soulful, warm, sexy, inviting, soothing, inspiring, and calming.It had been 4 years since their last set and "Poet's Walk" was more than worth the wait. From the stroll-in-the-park-with-your-mate instrumental title track to the opium-laced blue light reading of Take Your Time to the joyous bossanova of It Would Have Been Enough, this brief album is rock solid, top-to-bottom. The tracks range from good to exceptional."Poet's Walk" is perfect for a romantic evening, a small get-together, or just winding down. This is as real as it gets.
5327	Don't even rent it!: What a horrible movie. It has nothing to do with the acting. You can't blame bad acting when they're working with a terrible script. This film did absolutely no justice to the original text. Among its problems, first and foremost is the omition of essential characters, and the adding of pointless ones. If you decide not to heed my advice, and order it anyways, fast forward any scene involving the girl with the squigily mark on her forehead, (what the hell is that thing?).If you're a fan of Christian mythology, or anything to do with revelation, then by all means, the story is fantastic. A cross between Tom Clancy and the Bible. But, and it's kind of ironic that I say it this way, for the LOVE OF GOD, read the book, avoid the movie.
5328	Urban renewal in a cultural medium...: What a way to make movies: an accident like being bit by a radio active spider makes Jerry magnetic so that he de-Gaussed a whole shop of vhs tapes.So they rent their take offs on the movies that they make.The FBI crushes them as copyright infringement.Their one last movie is about how Fats Waller was born there.(in any sane world that would make it an historical site!).I guess there is humor in government hurting old black menwho are ones holding the community together and giving it traditions,but it is lost in the tears.
5329	Poor: Lasted a month. The tip is too soft. Bangs against glass after only a month. Disappointed. Better products out there.
5330	racoons vs PetSafe 5-meal pet feeder: Racoons kept dragging the whole feeder away.I tried weighting it down with a concrete stepping stone -- which prevented them moving it much. But the weight apparently jammed the device, which caused the gears inside to strip out!So I bought another one, and this time I weighted it, but with the stepping stone resting only on the very back edge -- and a wall. That worked better, but eventually again stripped out again.I plan to try once more, this time screwing the feeder to a heavy board underneath. Actually, before I again ordered one, I looked in a local pet supply store for another automatic feeder. The only one in stock had its battery door on the bottom -- no obvious way to keep it safe from racoons.
5331	Solid Biography: Having just finished Chambers's "Witness," I was pleased (mostly) that Tanenhaus tells much of the same story breezily, though still in more than 500 pages. He is at his best during the hearings and trials, tautly rattling off questions and responses, cutting through the fog of Chambers's too-close account, making the more arcane controversies intelligible.In Chambers's early life, Tanenhaus sticks to the evidence and refrains from speculating about Chambers's motives for joining the Communist Party, for example. I was somewhat disappointed that he didn't provide more in the way of interpretation, but by the time of Witness's publication, Tanenhaus begins to satisfy this craving for critique.Most important, Tanenhaus succeeds in making his subject sympathetic in all his flawed humanity. His story has become central (in an odd way) to America's story of the first half of the 20th century--and beyond. But he continues to fascinate because he was so unlikelyy, an American original.
5332	a swashbuckling thrill!: I have seen this movie only once, and it is definitely my absolute favorite movie of the year.The plot is exciting to the very end, shocking at times, and johnny depp is absolutely delicious as captain Jack Sparrow.If you have never seen this movie, I sincerely reccomend trying it. It is suspenseful, thrilling, and jam-packed full of exciting special effects. The humor is absolutely perfect, and both Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp are WONDERFULL!
5333	Number madness: My previous attempt to review this film apparently "censored" by Amazon.com staff, and rightly so, considering the words I had used... I think that I would not need to say much more.However, I must confess something about me: I hate cyberpunk and I hate hip-hop even more! I don't think that the ideas are so original in this film and I believe it is somewhat overrated. By for me, that is beside the point. I find this film very aestehtically dipleasing and I could barely force myself to watch it.I do understand that certain people may have a completely different opinion thatn mine, but that is a matter of personal taste. As another viewer said, "you'll either love or hate" this film. Apparently, this film was reviewed by people who loved it (who knows, other angry reviews might have been removed and people didn't bother again! ;-).So, that is my warning to anyone pondering to buy this film, especially after having read the raving reviews here... :-)
5334	Good price on a Hard-to-Find Tool: Could not find this tool locally. This tool required for proper headlight adjustments on my SN-95 Mustangs. Good quality. Good price.
5335	A big let-down....: I saw practically all of the series on E4 and thought it was absolutely fantastic, if a bit weird. Olivia Hallinan is a fantastic actress. Then I learned it was based on a book, so I got it out the library. I was amazed at how un-like the tv show it was.I was expecting a lot more to happen in it. The tv show is apparantly very loosely based on the book, and personally, I think that's a good thing, because the book was pretty crap.Kim has to move to a new school, and when she arrives, bumps into Maria Sweet a.k.a. Sugar, the leader of the girls in the school. They immediately become staunch friends, and Kim finds herself falling in love with her. There are a few lesbian antics in it, but hardly anything compared to the series. You can decide whether that's good or bad, I'll leave that up to you. But as for a storyline, I couldn't really find one.The book isn't all bad, there are some mildly amusing bits, but generally it disappoints.
5336	painful: Although there are a few edgy tracks, such as LaLa, most of this CD is glaringly obvious of Simpson's lack of talent and mediocre voice. Pieces of Me is catchy, but only because of the song itself, and Shadow falls flat coming from a well known tv actress and center of a reality show. The rest of the tracks try to transform Simpson's average voice into edgy rockerish, but instead end up quite painful and fake. Although I'm not a big fan of Avril, she succeeds at what Ashlee attempts and fails at. I'd recommend buying Avril's CD instead, or just buying the better of Simpson's singles. Basically, Ashlee tries to boost her own fame using her sister's fame in the music business, where obviously Ashlee does not belong.
5337	Very Bad Idea: I returned this because it failed when used for an advertised purpose. The manufacturer at [...] rated it for a tounge weight of 350 lbs. It is an accessory adapter and not intended for towing; I used it to mount a 48lb cargo basket which I loaded with an ice chest scaled at 100lbs. I operated my car at/under posted speed limits over paved roads for a period of three days. On removal of the adapter I found that it had bent down so the insert for the receiver frame was no longer in alignment with the socket for the hitch accessory.I would frankly rate the Curt adapter as a potentially serious road hazard and strongly recommend against Amazon making it available. If it bent after three days of use within its rated weight what would have happened on a longer trip? Maybe put my ice chest on the hood of someone else's car on the freeway?I've replaced it with an equivalent Reese product which DOES have a towing rating and appears to be a much stronger design. And was less expensive...
5338	Best video for 6-14 monthers: My son loves the Old Macdonald Baby Einstein Video. It's got so many beautiful scenes that keep changing to keep his attention. He loves the different puppets, kids and adults performing various acts, and the music (well, at least I think that's why he can't stay away). He also loves the Mozart one which seems to be geared towards the younger kids.If you're starting your own baby registry, you might like the suggested baby essentials at the website, allmomsareperfect.com. You'll get down to earth tips on what you must get versus what you can live without along with motherhood stories and tips for navigating that first year of mommyhood.
5339	Slow.Slow.Slow: Slow.Slow.Slow.Enough saidI really wanted to burn Hemingway alive (but...that's out of the question)Plot was awfully developed.
5340	Way Beyond the Good Days: No vocalist had the vocal punch and drive of Buddy Greco....but that was countless years past. By the time this CD, Walk A Little Faster, was recorded, that vocal distinction of Buddy Greco was sorely lacking. This CD, to this reviewer, is a grave disappointment. Save your money.
5341	Hilarious and Encouraging!!!: The politics of church is the backdrop for this action-packed saga which reveals the real men behind the clergy collars. Some are good people who have experienced bad things, while others are bad people who position others to be bad for their own personal benefits. The most unlikely and unexpected things happen as this story unfolds, and a developing romance between the up and coming Reverend Theophilus Simmons and a bold young lady named Essie ties it all together. Family connections lend support to generational strongholds as a small group works diligently to effect change. As the struggle between good and evil continues, this story shows us that to be on the side of right requires sacrifice, and that evil rarely looks beyond the realm of self. Thank you, Michele, for encouraging and reminding us to stay on the side called right!
5342	The legend is reborn!: That's right! The slogin used for Godzilla 1985 is what I'm using to describe this game! The original was a classic! This one brings the classic game back to life with many more challenges! Those who are hooked to those boring bloody games, like Mortal Kombat, should try the originals, they are way funner!
5343	God-awful adaptation: You cannot be a fan of Stephen King's classic book, "'Salem's Lot", and think that this was a good adaptation.Apparently this nightmare was supposed to be based on the Stephen King book "'Salem's Lot", but after watching it I was left wondering. It is very clear that there was a concerted effort to "re-imagine" and update the original story in order to make it appeal to a new audience, but fans of the book will hate what's been done here. When I heard that 'Salem's Lot was being made into a mini-series, I was very excited because it's my favorite King book. Also, recent adaptation have been good (The Shining) or even excellent (The Stand). But oh boy, what a let down it turned out to be. The flow of the movie is disjointed and inconsistent, and there are major deviations from the plot of the book. Not to mention how boring this thing is.In case you really want to watch this heap of crap, I won't spoil it for you. But wait until you get a load of how this things ends!
5344	One most poorly designed notebooks on the market: When I bought my HP Pavillion ZD180 Notebook I was excited about the HT technology and the allure of power that suggested.I soon became disgusted with the design flaw of this notebook, both intake air vents and fans (needed to cool these hot running twin processors) are situated on the bottom of the device. Because this model has an oversized display screen,and a very hungry pair of top end Intel 4's, the battery after boot-up will power device for 2 hours maximum. The fact that you can not use this laptop on your lap makes it a notebook computer,at least that was the official word from HP when 3 months after purchase motherboard melted and HP had it back for a 100% re-fit.Although the service was fast,free and professional, the design flaws outweighed the speed capable by this firecracker of a "NOTEBOOK".I call it a firecracker because is races but quickly is a memory.Dave AdamManteo,NC
5345	Perfect for model builders: I originally found these at a home building products store. Though promoted as an alternative to sandpaper for construction projects, they were a perfect addition to other sanding pads and papers I use for building model aircraft and cars. When I needed more, the store no longer carried them. They are available in 220 and 400 grit, can be cut to needed sizes easily with scissors, can be used wet or dry, and are very flexible to conform to just about any contour. I recommend them highly to model builders.
5346	Mulligans: I'm not a film critic by any means, but I have to say this movie is awesome. It touches upon a part of some gay men that most don't know, and/or hear about. I know several men that have gone through this scenario, for fear of being open and the embarassment of there family. Great job to all who were involved in this movie, it was vvery well done.
5347	Not worth the read: The Skin I'm In, by Sharon G. Flake was an okay book. The book was very descriptive, yet didn't have much of a theme to it. I felt compelled to read the book as it was very realistic and descriptive, but I don't think I'd recommend the book to anyone. I also feel the book dealt with older than described incidents during the book.
5348	!!!!!!!!!!!!: when i heard this stupid a$$ cd i had to laugh so loud!!!!! it is gotta be the stupidest stuff ever there like the rap and r&b boy band stupid stuff that is what i like to call straight up wack(this cd is 100% wack ya dig?)
5349	Not enough scent to annoy humans: I purchased the product based on the reviews from others that it was strong enough to annoy humans. This has proven to be entirely untrue. If you hold the product up to your nose, it is repulsive. However, if you use this product on something like a tree, at 5' high, a human would have to be within 1 or 2 feet literally to be able to smell it at all.Since this product is designed to repel cats and dogs, and their olfactory senses are much more sensitive, it might work for cats and dogs (although my dog is not bothered by it).It DOES NOT work to repel humans from an area as some reviews have indicated, unless perhaps they are leaning ON the pole where you apply the product.
5350	Different cover and book: The book that I needed for class had more reading then just the play. It looks like the book in the picture. However, I got sent Hamlet that is just the play and a different book cover.
5351	Repetitive, repetitive: I, as did others, have a non-academic interest in the witch hunts, and although I have no opinion on whether or not her data is valid, I found that she repeated the same points and examples throughout all the chapters. I couldn't even finish the book because I had felt that I probably read all the new information and that there wasn't much new to add.Fortunatly, I picked up the book cheaply and didn't have to use it for a class. I think that the idea was appealing, but the execution of the work fell very short.
5352	Does not work with Treo 650: This product did not work at all with my Treo 650. When I plugged it in my computer said there was an unknown USB device and it would not recognize the phone. After that, it would not even charge the phone while plugged into a wall outlet.I would give it less that 1 star if I could.
5353	very basic and boring: If you want to learn London Bridge or Marry had a little Lamb.Does not have enough techniques for the beginner!
5354	You will learn very little: The book is titled "Bobby Fischer TEACHES chess". This book has no lesson plans, doesn't have any more than the most simplistic positions in diagrams to "find a checkmate". I ask: how do I acheive the checkmate position first? This book provides nothing. I ask: tell me how to start or open a game? This book provides nothing? How about how to read moves in chess notation and yet again this book provides nothing. Toss it into the fireplace and it provides something!
5355	Not Good: I'm twenty miles from three transmitters. This antenna didn't work for me. I recommend against buying it!!!
5356	Who is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?: I have to agree with every other reviewer, this is an outstanding movie. It has it all, intrigue, suspense, laughs, love....and above all, great food!Please, Please, PLEASE put this on DVD!
5357	CU/Comic Upgrade ruined this game: I loved this game from day one almost 2 years ago and went through all the changes, but the CU I cant stomach anymore, I gave it a shot and sure if you like grouping with friends Im sure it might be fun. But all my friends have already canceled and tried making new ones and they hate the game now too and cancel and trying to solo and get xp has become impossible now. I have a Jedi too and they forced us to have to group now if we want to gain xp so now we could be hunted consistently by BHs. So unless this game goes back or gets a major overhaul again. Dont waste your money, this is still a beta and shouldnt be paid for or have a monthly fee. Ive gone to Guild Wars (no fees).
5358	Way too small for standard CART bag: I read all the review before ordering. All I can say is most of these folks must have some really, really small cart bags. I tried my wife's bag, my bag, an old and very small cart bag I had. I could not even get them in with every pocket empty. Only our lightweight stand bag would fit. I have two SKB bags that are a hard top with soft bottom that I have been using for years that hold our bags easily. SKB quality is tops though.
5359	Ridley Scott's modern masterpiece!: This film is a sickening, grotesque, and very unsettling piece of sci-fi / horror that will leave you breathless. This film will terrify, horrify, and amaze you with scenes that reach levels of suspense not reached since 1979's original 'Alien'. The visual effects are beautiful, the acting is fantastic (especially great Michael Fassbender), and nearly every scene is adrenaline-pinching. There is no doubt that this will end up being one of the best films of the year. This is definitely better than some of Scott's more modern movies (Gladiator, Hannibal, Robin Hood, etc.). He is a visionary of a director, and is one of the best in the business. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loved ALIEN.
5360	What a combination!: I was a Nelson Riddle fan before Linda Ronstadt. I had no idea what a beautiful voice she had. I bought the first 2 LPs they did together. When the digital age came, I lost track of those LPs. I only recently found this MP3 collection of their 3 LPs at Amazon. It is wonderful. One of the things that I like is that they do the few lines of introduction that used to be a part of song writing. A good example is What'll I Do. Notice that the song starts out with "Gone Is the Romance . . ." Most renditions of the song skip this, which is real shame. This rendition is clearly the best ever done of a great song. The combination of Nelson and Linda is made in heaven in my opinion.By the way, I highly recommend putting your MP3s onto the Amazon Cloud Player. I have worried for years that I would lose a hard drive and all my music with it. That worry is gone now and I can access my music on any device that can connect to the Internet. Whew!
5361	Not Comprehensive: I bought this for my father who is a Duesenberg fanatic. The CD looks like it was printed from someone's home computer, but is not priced accordingly (this is way overpriced). The CD cover is taped to the front of the CD case. My father was disappointed that this was not a comprehensive library of Duesenberg advertising as it implies. He owns several ads that weren't even listed in here. He had hoped it would show ads he knew existed but hadn't yet seen. This would be a better product if it were in DVD format and if it were comprehensive.
5362	Don't waste your time on this camera!: I reviewed this camera previously when I first purchased it. I had to send the first camera back as it had a bad adapter. I was also disqusted to realize that it is not compatible with windows ME. So, after getting a second camera sent to me with a new adapter, and after getting software to support windows me, now my computer will not recognize my connection to the camera...bad connection cords?! I am tired of wasting my time and energy trying to get this camera to work for me. It is not worth the money (even on sale). Buy a better camera...and don't buy a Polaroid as their customer service is non-existent!
5363	The Best of the Best: Lord of the Rings is the best fantasy epic ever told. JRR Tolkien is a genius in the art of storytelling. If I had the money I, this box set would be on my bookshelves. Until I do it will stay in my wish list. This set has illustrations from Alan Lee. If you don't recognize the name, he is like the official artist of Middle-earth. He even did the concept art for the films. This is a hardcover set so you know it is a good investment for multiple readings over time. I've read The Lord of the Rings twice and plan to read it again next year before the final film is released. If you are a true fan, upgrade to a better set. This is my set of choice. When I get some cash set aside, I will purchase it, I think you should also.
5364	one rotten apple: I see that there is a used copy for 50 cents. That person probably feels the way I do about this book. I know one of the people that testifies and what is reported is very dramatic, very romantic and almost pure fantasy. And if there's one very rotten apple in the barrel. . . we need to assume, unfortunately, that they're all rotten. I expect fact checking if this was intended as a document, a primary source or as non-fiction. Dramatizing to improve sales is getting old. . . .
5365	Mind numbingly bad - it must have been the cold.: You can only use that "Look out! Avalanche!" ploy once in a movie. Unfortunately here it is used again and again and again. Usually leaving the one "avalanched against", hanging from an ice axe and blowing hard to indicate fright. Whenever the plot stalled, which was often, there was an explosion and another avalanche. This is a truly dire movie. And don't get me started on Scott Glenn......!!!!!
5366	An overlooked classic...: That I past off when it first came out. I don't regret it since I doubt my experience at that time would of allowed me to truly understand the humor. I'm grateful I bought this one.
5367	Holy holes in a story, Batman!: Trashing long-time characters wearies me. I won't divulge any key plot elements, but the solution to the mystery is such a stretch, it reminds me of when writers were commanded to have Alfred rise from the dead and be revealed as "The Outsider", way back in the early days of the "new-look" Batman. E.g., at one point, Hal Jordan, another DC character they keep re-trashing, who knows who the killer is since he's now the Spectre (whew!), tells Green Arrow to really punish said killer when they uncover him/her. Well, when you find out who the killer is, you'll realize that Hal would never have said that. Any rate, the motive for the murder is so convoluted, all I can say is, DC should let the pros (Frank Miller, Alan Moore, Keith Giffin) write these epics. And enough with killing and defiling the memories of long-time characters!
5368	An Excellent Film: OK, so Hollywood of course blended some of the facts and made this film a wee bit more Hollywood, but the end results are an excellent film with an outstanding cast. The story of the five Sullivan brothers from their young years, till they entered the Navy following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. They did everything as one unit, they played, they fought and they protected each other at all costs. Thomas Mitchell leads the cast as their Dad and Anne Baxter plays the love interest of the youngest Sullivan boy, later in the film. I love this film and would recommend it to anyone, really...it's just the kind of film anyone, young or old can enjoy.
5369	Horrible: I bought this to give it a listen. To me it is horrible. Described by some as dreary and droopy, it sure is. Once was enough, it is off to the used cd store. A whole generation, if you will, grew up on this sorry state of music pushed by the record companies. At least I gave it a go. There is alot of other good music not so "popular".
5370	bubble lights: The lights are fine, but the clips on them that are used to attach the lights to the tree are seriously defective. They break off as soon as you try to clip them to the tree, rendering them next to useless. If you are looking for bubble lights, my advice. Look eslewhere
5371	Venus and Mars Starter Kit: What an excellent collection of ideas to get you and your lover started once the dinner-and-a-movie routine has run it's course. I actually read all the right-hand pages first (that's the naughty stuff) but found myself drawn to the nice side, too. There's great inspiration here for rekindling romance, or sparking it in the first place if you have a hard time finding your partners soft spot. We don't take the book literally like an instruction manual but instead springboard off into our own fantasies. It's a welcome way to start a conversation with your lover over a "touchy" subject. Enjoy!
5372	I'm one of those people.: I'm just one of those film critics who criticize everything. I'm the guy on the forums picking apart even the best films because of my lack of creative talent. I use words like, 'unsound', 'wretched', and 'inadmissible' to describe the talents of other people. This is usually just an act of defiance. Plus it draws attention to me at the yacht club gatherings. Yes, I am one of those people, the people you all hate. I am far from being a film maker, I am simply a film critic. I will never make a film. I will never even write a book. However, three seconds before I die, a light will flow over my eyes and I will see that I have wasted my life and the time of people like you. Honestly, this movie kicked ass, I know it, you know it.
5373	Another side of a great President: Readers who admire Ronald Reagan will enjoy getting to know the human side of the man through the eyes of someone who worked with him, respects him, and loves him. It's easy to read, and it's inspirational.
5374	BLOOD AND PUS: I think Western and Oriental people have rather different mentalities to comprehend and like similar things. Because I didn't understand this "brilliant, awesome, ingenious and so on and so on..." flick. When you read the synopsis everything seems to be right and at its place. But then you start watching... Oh, those mentalities...Try to recall "Visitor Q" and "Tetsuo: the Iron Man" if you watched them, then put them together and add a good amount of surrealism aside from "Tetsuo". And you'll get "Organ". Or maybe you have to do something more because it's by far more complicated than that. Speaking of "Tetsuo" - Kei Fujiwara, the director and actress in "Organ" had a part in that movie.Well I don't know what to say maybe I'll have to watch it for the second time so everything becomes clear. Although I doubt it will. And for gore-hounds I can say "Organ" is pretty abominable at times, gruesome and morbid. Lots of blood, pus and other excretion. Not for the squeamish obviously.
5375	I Think It Kicks Butt!: This guy knows how to teach! Learn authentic killer licks from the greats and it's done in a logical, pragmatic approach. One minus, it would be convenient to have a tab book included. -but it did make me write out the licks which was to my benefit and it was easy. One of the best guitar dvd's out there.
5376	praise for in-depth research: Few books written about the Lincoln Assassination have brought to life, the participants of this event. Historical interpretor Michael (Supt. A.C. Richards) Robinson, beautifully puts it that the Lincoln Assassination is "America's Greek Tragedy". Here is the often overlooked or misunderstood Powell brought to life in an era we can hardly understand. Many authors use a 21st century perspective on a time and event that is difficult to put into a modern context. Most books present an inaccurate portrayal of this co-conspirator. Owensby has done an oustanding job helping the reader understand the man, the event and the times. Three cheers for "Alias".
5377	You Get What You Pay For: While this is a functional holster, be aware that you may -- like me - find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster. I know, I know. You can turn off the "answer phone when opened" option, but that is not preferred by everyone.You may also find that the phone does not stay in the holster securely.
5378	Best Release from The Plan Yet: I thought nothing could top "Dismemberment Plan is Terrified". Maybe I'm a bit impartial, I think I am their number one fan. For those who don't know The Plan, they are pop-punk, quirky and catchy. Not that any of that is bad. I have been anticipating this album FOREVER, since i have heard them play a lot of these songs live since 1998. My personal favorite on the album is "Gyroscope", but "The City" and "A Life of Possibilities" are slso excellent.
5379	Great travel game: This is perfect for a child who is not quite ready for a memory game. It teaches matching and shapes and a little dexterity without the stress of not knowing where things are. My daughter seemed to "master" it quickly though so it became a speed game after a while.It comes in a small container which is great for traveling.
5380	A must-read for anyone considering adoption: Thank you, Jesse Green! Your book expressed many of my own feelings as a gay Jewish man who has always wanted children. The book first tells of Andy (Green's lover) and his family, then of Green himself, and then their life together. Along the way, the reader learns the realities of adoption for a single gay man, from the mixed reactions of family to the distancing of gay friends. The book has moved me to start the process myself
5381	DO NOT BUY!!!: I totally agree with the 1 star review....I bought the DVD as soon as it showed up and found it very SAD....No extras..... NO chapters......
5382	huh..... well......... not a bad thing to play around: huh..... well......... it's not a bad thing to play aroundit's a really cool thing for non musical person but....... to me....... i bought it .... but it's totally a toythe sound quality, not yet CD quality,the control not accuarte and not stable......... that is to me as a persion who start producing some music for 1 year, and using some real gears..... this thing fun to play, just for fun!yet is you are professional DJ, go for..., not this unstable baby.www.mp3.com/dxl
5383	Only for those who can be easily hypnotised.: I didn't care for the speaker's voice as some said. I tried very hard to make this work but it did nothing for me.
5384	Add my voice: In general, I don't think you should review something you have not experienced. This time I want to join the others who are protesting the studio releasing the short version of the films first. I will wait for the extended version. I waited originally and bought the standard version with the toys!
5385	Don't Waste 1 Cent On This "book"!: If car salesman have a bad name, the publisher of this book has given their industry a black eye!This book is a joke.First, the trim size is about as large as those $1 mini-mags that sell at the check out counter of your local supermarket.Second, it could be read in 5-10 minutes.Third, there is nothing new to learn here.Fourth, my review is about as long as the book!This is the first item I have ever returned to amazon.I wasted my money, do NOT waste your hard earned dough.For something really helpful, stick with Zig or Joe Girard.
5386	rips apart at the seams: this is a great bag for a season or less!i only have two mitts shoes and a bat not much to really stuff the bag the zipper lasted longer than the seams the color options is why i chose this bag to be able to find it out of the crowd of bags. that was the good thing about this bag
5387	different but so enticing!!: I absolutely enjoy the colors, the text, and how my daughter is pulled into this book as I read it to her. I wasn't impressed with the price but what can you do? Its quality is above Dora's & Caillou's books.Frankly, at the beginning when we began watching the series on television, I didn't like the idea. When I saw how my daughter wanted mommy to keep the channel on, I left it, and I too now like it a great deal. While reading, you have to try and immitate how the characters speak on television to get into it as a reader (with Zowie my favorite)I find Caillou books too wordy, while this series is cute with the words rolling off your tongue as a nice change.
5388	The later the season, the less interesting it becomes.: It seems to me that the earlier seasons were much more interesting. Maybe they started to struggle with storylines because the war had actually already ended years ago?But still, I will always love this series. and Rick Jason is so hot. Too bad he ended life in such a sad way. and Vic Morrow- what a hero. Even died in true hero fashion..
5389	Welcome Back Chaka: Anything new from the wonderful voice of Chaka Khan is a real treat, and this album is almost a masterpiece. Her voice is as a wonderful instrument and her rich contralto has never sounded better. Spoon is incredibly sexy, and Drama is mesmerizing. The funky tracks really swing and the ballads are beautifully sung. My only caveat would be that some of the productions are a little stale. This is noticeable especially on Drama which is marred slightly by the intrusive drum machine.I would have loved to have heard more arrangements like those of Between the Sheets on the Fourplay album, and Miles Across the Room, where she benefits from a more sensitive context for her amazing voice.
5390	Xmas every day? Does this movie ever end?: Although some of the classic Sesame Street sytle is here, this is way too long leaving the viewer wondering if this tedious story will ever end..and a grumpy Santa to boot! What my kids remember most? That Elmo shatters his snowglobe(no I'm not giving away the story.) Now, every single snowglobe that has entered our home in 3 years gets the "wish,wish'wish" and thrown on the pavement treatment. We just got Tim Allen's Santa Clause. Pick that over this! The magic is real and the plot keeps moving at a wonderful pace. Humor far excels Sesame Street's also. If you liked Elmo in Grouchland, you'll probably like Elmo Saves Christmas. We didn't like either.
5391	Patience & Communication: I ordered Cholodin Canine 500 through Amazon who turned the order over to one of their affiliates, Entirely Pets.Product arrived within a week, but the bottle looked old and beat up and the pills smelled funny, so I called the Lab that manufactures the pills to see their date of mfg. They were two years old (already). So I called Entirely Pets, explained and was told that they did have six month old product they would ship. They shipped but the mfg date was the same as the two year old bottle I had already received. So either the re-order person or shipping forgot what the issue was.So called Entirely Pets again, they shipped me a label to return both bottles to them. That was a week ago, have not heard that they received product or that they have credited my account as promised. So we wait. Have spent entirely to much time on this ~ If it's not a product Amazon stocks themselves, I will not order anything again.
5392	Terrible product: This telephone has a nasty habit of not connecting when dialing. Probably 20 percent of my calls need to be redialed. Also, when using another extension in the house, this phone picks up and does not hang up...keeping the line in use when the extension is turned off. I have called AT&T; Their customer service is the pits. There is nothing wrong with my line or jack - this problem occurs on any jack in the house.Do not buy this phone
5393	Instant Classic: Ben really knows how to play live. If you haven't seen him in concert you are truly missing a great experience. This CD although a little dodgy on sound quality still will be and instant classic. Even if you are not a ben fan this will be an enjoyable experience for you. And if you ever have the chance go see him in real life make the best of it.
5394	okay - but not really for a beanbag: These beads are super heavy and probably suitable if are making your own stuffed dolls, but not really any good for a beanbag chair, unless you bought a whole mes of them, and then your beanbag would be pretty darn heavy. The bag was smaller than a pillow you'd put on your bed, maybe a third of that size in volume, so it is not going to help fill anyone's beanbag, because if that's all the extra stuffing you need, you probably haven't even noticed yet.
5395	Great gift: This was a gift for my Boss and it really impressed.She travels a lot and it was just the thing she neededto put all her paperwork in and keep it organized.
5396	Where oh where has my little script gone????: It has been well over a month since I ordered this script, the audition has come and gone, oddly enough the script has yet to arrive!
5397	Ditto!: Let me just join the fray and say - fabulous!Some of the covers of recent tunes are a little stretched ("I Will Survive") but still manage to bring a smile at the effort. Overall, this album is refreshing and vocally stellar - I highly recommend this purchase.
5398	Terrible Results, all three died...: This product seemed the ideal ion generator to use by my desk as I worked at the computer. However, the first one I got died within three days. The seller graciously refunded me my money as they had no more in stock. I ordered another from another seller and this one died within three weeks. When I told them what happened, they also graciously sent me a replacement without my even specifically asking them to do so. This third one died within 48 hours! I either have the worse of luck or this is just a bad product. I took apart the first one that failed but I could find nothing wrong on the inside, not that there were any consumer replaceable parts. At least, I could confirm that it had real looking insides! Well three strikes and I am out, I won't even try any of this product again and would be hesitant to even buy any of that brand.
5399	Cool-Running USB 2.0 Hub: The D-Link DUB-H7 is a nifty little USB 2.0 hub. I've had all kinds of heat issues and resultant reliability problems with the 4-port Belkins and other USB 2.0 Hubs I have bought at Staples. The D-Link has 7 ports and runs COOL. I have significant power needs on the peripheral USB devices connected to the hub from a PC running Windows XP SP3. It is without question the best USB 2.0 Hub I have ever owned (I have owned at least half a dozen over the years.)
5400	Everyone in the U.S.A. should read this.: This book sound like this could happen here soon, its so real, so exciting to read. President Obama should read this before it happens in real life because we are doing everything the book talks about behind the the walls of the White House.
5401	Nice idea, so-so book: This book could have been so much better. I thought so much of the writing was trite and boring...some of it felt very awkward. Especially when the two extended families get together the scenes are very protracted and false-ringing. I did not feel touched by these characters, nor did the writing make me care about them, other than to be annoyed by Bitsy Donaldson and confused by Ziba. I think the idea was a good one, but it fails to deliver (in my opinion).
5402	Love It: A friend of mine had this CD and we would use it when we had a Quantum Touch healing circle.It is so beautiful and soothing it takes you to another place. I just had to have one of my own.I listen to mine every night when I go to bed, I drift off to sleep with beautiful images in my head.
5403	LeapFrog Leapster A/C Adapter: Seems to be working ok so far. Since this and other Leap Frog items were Christmas gifts, you should give us time to fully see if they work properly.
5404	DON'T LISTEN TO "BRIAN FORRESTER"!!!!!!!!!!!!: I own Madden 2006 and I came on to see what other people had to say, the first review I read was by "Brian Forrester". After reading it all I have to say is B.S.!!!!! I don't know what that dudes deal is but he couldn't have been more wrong with his review. Almost everything he said in his review was wrong. In his review he stated that '06 was the same game as '05 but with different rosters and player ratings. I have no clue how he can justify that considering they added a whole new NFL Soperstar mode (which by the way kicks ass) TH Madden '06 is a great game.
5405	Beer Bongs, Phone Sex, Cage Dancing Muppets????????: "It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie" had beer bongs, phone sex, an uncaring 'god', cage dancing and other material inappropriate for children. No, it was not subtle -- it was blatantly clear. We LOVE the Muppets! We would have hoped a muppet movie would be safe!
5406	Nice features for a nice price -- a good starter DV camera: I did a lot of research in looking for a camcorder. I knew I wanted DV because of superior picture quality especially when editing on a PC.It comes with all the basics, battery, charger, AC adapter, lens cap w/leash, remote control, RCA cables, and serial cable. Missing are a Firewire IEEE-1394 cable--this may be included with your firewire board though, S-video cable and SmartMedia card.Digital Still photo quality is decent for web work but I wouldn't print larger than a 4 x 6 picture. You can write digital stills to the tape. However, using a SmartMedia card records them faster.I found the camera easy to use. Video quality is excellent thanks in part to a Canon lens. The optical zoom is fantastic 26x is more than enough for most people's needs. Digital zoom doesn't do much for you.Overall, it's a good value especially if you take advantage of the rebate and free accessory kit.
5407	Avoid this chopper: This chopper lasted just over a month before the blade came apart and cracked the base. I called and emailed Cuisinart for replacement. They just ignored me. Don't waste your money.
5408	Excellent Music: This CD is one you can listen to over and over again. you just can't get tired of it. My favorite song is "Ohureo". It's so incredibly haunting how the vioce seems to tell a tale. This Cd seems seems to energize you as it relaxes. I highly recommend this CD.
5409	This will take your breath away.: My tub of kitty litter did not state if it was scented. Unfortunately when I opened it - it was so - I figured I'd give it a shot and well .... this litter is great if you don't mind your house smelling like cat pee + litter.I have a brand new Litter Robot that I empty every other day and a 4 month old kitten. I'm pretty lax about my litter standards - it just needs to keep the poo/pee smell in for 48 - 72 hours, not stink up my house, and not coat my house in a layer of dust. After a week there was litter everywhere, my cat smelled like the litter, and I couldn't get over the combined smell of cat waste + the scent of this litter.It took me a week to de-funk my LR. It took me multiple applications of Zeolite, Nature's Miracle and trips to the Carwash. It was a disappointing experience.
5410	The DNC's 2nd Choice Canidate: I must admit while I was having fun listening to Howard Dean's speeches because I agreed with him a lot, at leased he was consistant and didn't flip-flop on his ideas. I honestly don't know where Kerry stands on the issues because he has flip flopped over everything! I wish Dean was still the nominee because at leased we had a clear choice for canidate! And the sad part is, Kerry wasn't the DNC's top nomination. Dean was. And I can't believe it's too late. This unfortuntately spells re-election for Dubya. The Democrats are doomed. from an Independent.
5411	word salad as verbal Rorschach test: let the high preists of deconstructionist post modernism interpret it for you. bow down before the wisdom of frustrated ineffectual professors of English, the preistly class who will interpret this message from the gods for you, (and actually get pay and respect for it). lets get real. this is a book by a sciziphrenic for the pompous and pedantic. a few puns aside dont waste your life trying to interpret this nonsense, just because you have an ego. (even Nobel laureates fell for it--hence the quark, but FASHIONABLE NONSENSE is the delayed reaction)the real dope: read: WHAT ART IS. MADNESS AND MODERNITY. and THE FOUNTAINHEAD. for some insight into why nonsense like this continues to propagate.
5412	Be cautious: The book was advertised as new and i paid for expedite shipment. But unfortunately, the book was delivered via regular shipment, the book was used (not new), and it did not contain the CD for the book.Nevertheless, when i returned the book, my money was refunded. Still, i lost time in waiting for the book, returning the book and getting my money back. And i even incurred shipping charges when i returned the book.
5413	Interesting bit of Appalachian folklore mixed with fiction.: I found the book dragged in places, but overall, a very good book. I was unaware, until later, that the Ballad of Frankie Silver was a true story, passed down from the generations in the Appalchians. The author writes a good mystery and I was surprised at the ending. I would recommend her books to anyone.
5414	BAD PRODUCT!!! Warning!: BAD PRODUCT- Has a major design flaw that when a Projector of only 12.5 lbs was mounted to it within a few minutes the projector crashed to the floor! $3,500 Loss!!!! This was mounted in a House of Worship, a huge loss to us, huge!The square tubing only has a small indent holding it together even with bolts tight! It's only a matter of time once something is mounted to it before it will come apart and crash to the ground.I have no idea what to do for replacement of our Projector. But have had no luck with Amazon in some cases.VideoSecu Universal LCD/DLP Projector Ceiling Mount Bracket White Fits both flat or Vaulted ceiling PJ2W 1CA
5415	hmm..: this was one of my favorites when i first played it.. but after all these years.. i have to say it isn't the best of the best..when you compare it to all other final fantasies, this one sticks out like a sore thumb.. but the battle system is interesting! i don't like how the main character (Squall) is emo-like at the start... but once again he changes because of a certain someone... *cough* RINOA! *cough* *cough*overall... GREAT GAME!! :D
5416	Where Were The Editors??: I used this book in a 400-level computer science course (and I did get an A) and found it incredibly frustrating.Most of the meat of the book is well presented and fairly well written.But! There were so many errors and ommisions in chapter-ending questions, diagram figures, and charts/figures that anything otherwise positive about the book was cancelled out.My edition was new as of Spring '98, it and the previous two versions used by students in my class were loaded with errors.The bottom line, what book addresses the subject better? I have to think this is a good buy, just wait for a newer edition and hope that the complex performance/cost analysis questions aren't already doomed by errors.
5417	Not worth the money: Santa brought this for Christmas. It did not last two days! The mic feels nice and heavy and looks great. The problem is in the wiring. Bad design!
5418	The Worst Burner Ever!!!!!!: I have used HP burners and had no problems. However, the Plextor boasts being the best but just can't deliver. Final result was the plextor manager crashed my hard drive. So back it goes to California......where it belongs!
5419	Great Resource to Have: Orginally purchased for a graduate class I was taking, however, I've found that I am referring to this classic reference guide for most formal papers and business proposals. If you write formal propoals this is a great resource to have in your personal library.
5420	great mysteries: great shows with miss marple would tell people to watch this and buy from this place again if you like mysteries this is the show for you
5421	Poncin' in the Hood: Yet another panegyric to the Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name. Ugh. Can't these rappers find something else to endlessly extol other than their fetishistic penchant for rootering their fellow man? There's a whole world of sensual delights out there, and some of them just might involve the opposite sex, you know, and orifices other than the excretory one (and one of them is actually designed for the purpose of carnal congress).Sorry if that's too boring for these blustering sodomites, but I'm tired of hearing about the glories of glory holing from these posturing pansies. Why don't they try going straight, for once?
5422	McCaffrey's done better stuff...: This book was quite a disappointment after being brought up on McCaffrey's excellent Pern series. I expected something a bit more moving then *this*...at best, a rather bland muddle of confused conspiracies and an unlikable heroine.I don't know how much to pin on Moon - but I have heard that she's done excellent military books, so it's possible that the book's greatest strength can be attributed to her. While it failed to stir me in any way, the book does present a semi-realistic view of the military in the future. Hurrah. However, where the book goes astray is when the authors try to have it both ways - I have no problem with hard science-fiction, but when soft sci-fi sensibilities are mixed in with it - ugh.In short, save your money and go for some other stuff. This is not their top work.
5423	Does not have Mac OS X Drivers: I had to buy another separate program called VueScan to get this scanner to work with Mac OS X.And VueScan is a nasty little piece of software in itself but it will have to do since there is nothing else.The built in Mac OS X Image Capture program does not detect this scanner.Just an FYI. I would not buy this canner if you need to use it with Mac OS X. Look elsewhere.
5424	Winter Relief for Gardners: Would make a great wintertime gift for a gardner. It was fun and informative. It would help to fill-in that awful winter void when we gardners can't play in the dirt.
5425	My Mommy says this MOVIE IS TOO SCARY FOR ME: Im 6 years old and my mommy doesnt want me to see this movie any more. She said the characters are scary and one of them is thrown into trian tracks. A little boy gets eaten by a wolf too.
5426	Tour music: We traveled to China and returned to make a slideshow. This music was perfect to include in our slideshow to portray the tour that we enjoyed tremendously. The beautiful music is a constant reminder of the wonderful time we had while there. We watched many performances while on our tour to China and this is a perfect music CD that brought our slideshow to life. Even if you cannot go to China, this is a good way to bring Chinese music to your home.
5427	Mastering Microsoft Access 2000 development: I have purchased just about every single Access book on the market in the pass five years. Alison Balter's Access 2000 development is the best book for client/server programming using Access 2000 as the front-end and SQL Server as the back-end.I have experience in building large multi-user applicatoins in other platforms, and was looking for a book that would show me how to do it in ACCESS 2000 and SQL Server. This is the book.Chapters 16-23 in PART III of the book are the best I've seem in any book describing concepts in designing and coding a large client/server system.The other two books I would highly recommend for ACCESS developers are ACCESS 2000 Developer's Handbook Volume 1 & 2 by Litwin, Gilbert, and Getz.The above books are not for beginning programmers but are for ACCESS developers.
5428	The One With All The Aggravation!: Like S.Boyer, I am having the trouble of not being able to play a legitimately purchased computer game because I also have a copying program on my computer. I also spent AT LEAST 20 minutes (on 2 different occasions) with customer support and both times was told I'd be getting an email with instructions on generating some report to submit to them - by the way, I'm still waiting for those emails. I finally got the report to run on my own and submitted it via email, but am now told it's incomplete. Since I don't even know exactly what the report says, I may never get the situation resolved! I am so disgusted with the whole thing and wouldn't recommend purchasing this game even for computer whizzes who might be able to figure out how to run it! I just don't think it should be this much trouble to play a game!
5429	This one is great too!: I just bought volumes 1-5 of the Kitsune Maison series, and they're all awesome!! The AmazonMP3 price is great right now. I can't wait for volume 6 to come out.(No, I'm not working for whoever produced these albums ... I just love great music at low prices :-P).
5430	Black's Law Dictionary: A wonderful resource for anyone associated with law. Thorough, effortless and exponentially helpful. The hardback version protects the contents from weathering.
5431	Affordable Noise Maker: Pros: Fits in case, completeness, costCons: Noise, thin plastic caseI had to return this product before I could try it because the noise created by this clipper is so unnaturally loud it scared me and the person I was going to trim up. I felt uncomfortable and so did they. Listen to the reviews because this clipper is very loud.
5432	Well, If It Worked...: I suppose I'd probably love this item for my baby ... IF IT WORKED. Arrived DOA. I'm going to buy a fresh a battery for it - see if that helps. If not, it's going back to Amazon.
5433	Good Job: I am currently teaching a high school class on first aid and emergency medicine. I found the information in this book to be very helpful. I am a Emergency Medical Tech and thought the author had many good ideas from personal exprience.
5434	Biased beyond belief: This book begins with the author feeling oppressed that she cannot get on to Mt. Athos. Athos like most monastic environments is segregated by gender. (I can't enter the clositer-enclosure of a convent of Carmelite nuns either). This diatribe aginst the Holy Mountain and its 1000 year old traditions signals the author's extreme bias against Orthodoxy Orthodoxy is seen as the source of all the evils and problems in Post-Soviet Eastern Europe. If you are looking to understand Orthodoxy avoid this book and read something by Seraphim Rose or Timothy Ware.
5435	Great book for teenagers: My son read this book at his high school and just had to have it! He loves the author's way of writing and reading about another culture.
5436	Detailed but Ponderous: The opening chapters filled me with hope for the remainder of the novel. The language was lyrical and satisfying, with an intrguing story which, one hoped, would reach a decent climax and conclusion. However, as the narrative progressed, we're overwraught with unnecesary detail, page after page of unreal recollection and boring prose. The book segways into a disappointing monotony which leaves the reader cold, no longer interested as to the fate of the protagonist. What's more, I found the book frustrating to read because of Atwood's inability to portray male characters accurately. She seems to believe that every man walks around with highly debauched and fetishised views of women. The ending is disappointing, yet somehow satisfying. It takes a good deal of effort to drag yourslef through the closing chapters, but here, at least, the narrative has some direction. The book is very long, unnecessarily long.
5437	The Quiet Man...Action, Humor, and Romance: A great movie, no matter your taste!!!!A must see!!! A touch of "The Emerald Isle" that everyone can appreciate!!Give it a try...you won't regret it!!! John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara at their best!!! = )
5438	pure trash: This is the most offensive movie I've seen in my life. Like porn, it has no plot and it's driven by the sick exploitative acts performed on the girl. I admit I have a sadistic side and enjoy sick and disturbing movies but the sheer inhumanness and depravity of this garbage just made me very angry.
5439	rust starts to develop quickly: When we first got the Anolon bakeware set we really liked it. It appeared to be high quality, with a thick non-stick coating, and grips on the ends molded with "Anolon"However, after a couple of months several pans started to develop a few spots of rust. Now that we've had the pans for 6 months they have large spots of rust everywhere. The rust is not only on the inside, but also on the outside, bottom, sides, and at the place where the metal folds over. Although the non-stick coating appears to be thick, I can't tell if it thins and then the underlying pan rusts, or if it is rusting from the inside out.I've attached the three rusty photos. 2 showing the rectangular pan (front and back) and 1 showing the cookie pan (back).Scott
5440	Glory!: I have just begun to read this book again (7th time now, Jan 2013) for the first time. It is reassuring that even though I am out in "left field" to most, and am not to Christ. This is a existential life affirming book, not for religion seekers. After seven reads there is not much left that I can underline for the seventh time. It is on my list of ten best books I have ever read in my 68 years. Blessed be the God of Ruth Borrows. And thank God for Ruth Burrows!
5441	Get "Lost": Lost is one of the best shows ever made.To all you guys who don't like this show go back to watching crap shows like "Stacked" or King of Queens.This is the best show ever made......I love this show!!!!!!!
5442	Bad Execution and battery life: I ordered 1 from amazon and I am waiting for about 60 days and they expect to ship it in October of 04. Bought 2 ugly blue ones at another online site and I am having a nightmare with it. It skips like crazy when working out and even after a full days charge dies in battery time after 2hrs of use. The color shading is also strange , it differs from top to bottom. Also the quality of the sound seems poor with the default headphones. I purchased some fontopia ones and it seems clearer. The second mini which was a present was DOA, and calling apple did not help as they want to replace it with a refurb.
5443	It works for what I need it for: The tripod projection screen arrived in a box that was fairly mangled, but the contents were OK. The legs seem a little flimsy, and it has 2 plastic buttons that concern me some. However, it seems to work well enough for now. Only time will tell if it is more durable than it looks.
5444	Awesome!: From the great intro to the very last song, this cd rocks. The Haunted have some very Slayer-esque riffs on this album, in some places, it sounds a lot like seasons of the abyss, but that's NOT a bad thing! This CD is an incredible display of talent and is, well, better than their previous two albums IMO. My favorite songs on this album would be "DOA" and "Sh*thead." This is just a great thrash album, so buy it now!
5445	A fun book for young kids: This book has rhyming text telling about various activities kids would do at school (reading, painting, playing on the playground, making music, having lunch, etc.) The words are cute, but the best part of the book is in looking for the bear. Children ages 2-4 will enjoy looking for the bear in this book. The illustrations will amuse parents and children.
5446	Far better than I expected: I purchased this for my kids because they seemed to recognize the main car everywhere we went. I think I enjoy this movie more than they do. I will gladly put it in the dvd player over and over because it is not one of those annoying "kid" movies. Well "acted" and fun to watch.
5447	Superbly Diverse: My wife and I have a Mac Mini hooked up to our TV. We wanted something with a very small foot print that could deliver great sound while watching movies, listening to rock, jazz, funk, classical, and our beloved podcasts. These speakers are absolutely amazing and the frequency range is excellent despite being a 3-speaker system. The bass just thumps. These speakers easily fill the room as we use these for our main home entertainment system. I would recommend these to anyone wanting big-speaker sound in a tiny, little package.
5448	Sound quality VERY poor: Like a lot of reviewers I find the difference in sound volume between the tracks and even in the tracks themslves to be extremely annoying and cannot believe that a professional sound engineer actually produced this CD.We have to put the volume up to ear-bleeding levels just to hear the loud parts - the quiet sections are inaudible.Full Disclosure: We bought this CD even after reading the other negative reviews because we thought people were being overly picky or were true audiophiles (which we're defintely NOT) but DO NOT BUY this recording if you'd like to actually listen to the music.
5449	Plenty of sublety and nuance - not much of a story: I only slogged through this snoozer because I had read A Dangerous Friend by Just and thought it was very good. Therefore, surely this book would eventually become interesting to read rather than the chore it proved to be. Not so.I found this to be a book that doesn't do a good job of developing its characters or its story. Even though I'm interested in Washington and its inside baseball, this book just didn't tell enough to be interesting. Everything was vague and cloaked in secrecy and dullness. Not a very good formula for a book in my view. The author is clearly a gifted wordsmith, but he failed me as a "storysmith" in this effort. I'd recommend you skip it.
5450	Picky Cats Prefer Precious Cat: My younger cat started peeing in front of the litter box to let me know she wasn't satisfied with the litter I chose. I started out with Cat Attract, which totally fixed the problem--she even started playing in the litter box she loved it so much. Then we transitioned into Precious Cat, at half the price she's still satisfied.
5451	A lot bigger then I expected: Great toy, My 5 yr old loved it and still plays with it.... He even puts a blanket on the top and uses it as his hide out!
5452	An Absolutely Brilliant Children's Book!: The children's book entitled "Am I Still Special" is a beautifully written book and has lovely pictures to complement the story! It is a "must have" book...especially if youhave the first book "Will The New Baby Be Bigger Than Me".This book takes on a liitle journey of how this boy is feelingwith the addition of a new family memeber and he wonders is he still special in his parents' eyes that there is a new baby in their home. Happy reading!!
5453	mj who? kitty pryde rules...: ultimate spider-man by bendis and bagley is one of the best series out there. not as much action and non-stop bad guy fighting, but a good mix of that and a lot of peter parker being a teenager with problems (girls, bullies, being grounded, etc.) along with his spidey life.the series is great great great. only a few minor things that could be better:1. i don't like how nick fury comes in and tells spider-man he's going to work his whole life for him and shield. the idea of peter being...trapped in a web? haha...well it isn't too cool. superheroes need to fight the good fight because they want to, not because shield will go and take away their superpowers (as fury has threatened) if they don't comply.2. bendis needs to cut down on the tuchas talk. seriously if parker grew up in nyc today he'd more likely speak spanglish than yanglish.3. geldoff.
5454	Bundled letters are poor quality: The original letters I bought were wonderful! To increase the words we could write I bought this bundled package; the quality is very different. These letters and numbers are not glossy and the paper covering them was peeling with several letters arriving broken. I suggest only buy the individual packages.
5455	TRASH! One of the worst films ever made.: Unless you like Troma (and I can't see how), you will absolutely abhor this piece of.... Sh$t.Bad acting, Bad Humor, VERY Bad Movie. DO NOT SEE THIS!!!What's even worse, I go to the same high school as the co-writer of this trash.
5456	Solid Product and not just for entry-level.: This is my 1st DSLR, but not my first digital camera, nor my first SLR. I spent more than a month researching various models, and while my lust for a full-frame sensor remains unabated, my wallet is thankful for lesser good things.I chose a Nikon for the lens catalog, which is a reasonable, and correct, choice. No matter what the huddled masses of marketeers would have us believe, mega-pixels are not the end-all of digital cameras. Lately some great articles have been written about this, a quick search for "mega-pixel myth" and the related will be most enlightening. Nor are lenses - and a good eye - go much further towards good pictures.Now if only I had a good eye...
5457	Porsche: Great ! just compare the specs with other PDA's and this one is truly the Porsche in PDA world. Lot's of RAM, fast, upgradeable and is complete, you don't have to buy more.... Can't do without it !
5458	A delightful collection of commentaries.: Bill Littlefield is at once funny, insightful, touching, and engaging. His writing is always worth reading. Keepers is a beautiful collection of Littlefield's radio commentaries that will keep you engaged to the very last. To call the collection a "sports book" falls far short of the mark, as Littlefield's essays are really about life. A delightful read!
5459	Gorgeous!: Beautiful, Indian-inspired design. These were larger than I expected, but so pretty. Heavy, quality-made jewelry.
5460	Rusting after only two months: I don't cook often, but I found the knives to be sharp but useless. Why? Because after only 2 months of sporadic use, they are already developing rust spots all over them. I don't even cook often, and always hand wash and dry thoroughly. They just are not a good purchase, especially at this price.Unfortunately, I got these as a gift so I won't even be able to complain to the store where I bought them. Simply a bad purchase.
5461	Excellent book on makeup: I wanted to learn about makeup to be able to prepare people for video interview and also to understand makeup when using Photoshop on portraits. This book gave me a very good basic understanding of how and what to apply. However it did more - it gave me new ideas about makeup and made me more willing to try different colors and approaches. The book has a fresh and new look at the whole art of makeup and I recommend it.
5462	Very nice, but not very complete.: The packaging is very nice, and it's a great gift for someone you know that loves Sex&The; City. Comes with 2 discs, but no extras :( That's why I rated it 4 stars...It would be nicer if there was more extras and the 1st movie was the extended version...I recommend it if you don't have any of the 2 movies, and you don't mind if it doesn't include any extras.
5463	Black and white photos can't be beat: The beauty of a black and white photo is the lighting on the subject. There is no distraction of color. The dark and light shadows bring out the beautiful features of the subject. The glamour shots of that era brought out a beauty or handsomeness that color cannot duplicate.
5464	Best bang for your buck!: I got these speakers for a gift and they are amazing. They are super light weight and portable and come with a nice carrying case that fits well in my purse/briefcase, so I can take them to and from work easily. It also protects my ipod, which was starting to scratch.The volume does not go loud enough for a party, but it is enough to fill a room and certainly more than plenty for my desk at work.I would have loved it if they charged my ipod while it is docked and if there was a cradle specifically for my Nano (the mini cradle works ok) but for the price, you can't beat it. They are worth evey cent!
5465	Save Your Money: Save your money and purchase the REAL stories 'outlined' in this cheap book put together to ride the wave of The Perfect Storm. The collection of stories is nothing more than a collection of extended abstracts of the real stories. Many of the 'abstracts' are taken out of context and the reader does not get an accurate picture of what and why the nautical situation developed or how it concluded. Pass on this one.
5466	Wasting talent: This cd is complete garbage except for the very last song. i wish these guys would stop wasting their talent and starting making metal instead of making mtv trl tennyboper ...pop punk garbage. they obviously have the ability to do it, but insead they waste their talent. i dont understand it. ive also heard that they do a cover raining blood by slayer live. i dont understand why they are wasting their talent instead of making good music. i give it two stars only because of the last song. the rest of the cd is complete forgetable.
5467	The Funny Thing is.. It's Not Funny: Its not fresh, it's not funny, it's just lame. As a longtime fan, I was looking forward to listening to the audio book on a 6 hour road trip-- spent $30 on it. After just five minutes, and another forced 10 minutes to give it another chance, my friend and I realized that not only could we not continue listening to it, we couldn't even "recycle" it to a bed-ridden friend in need of some amusement. Pure dreck. How did this get published?Karen, San Francisco
5468	Best Trackball: I have owned more than 15 different trackballs and this one is the best by far.Nuff said.
5469	Why I'm not happy with the Boston Greatest Hits purchase.: I loaded this CD into my CD player in the house and my CD player in the car. I discovered that there are NO labels to the CD as well as to each individual Track. So when the music play plays the screen on both players is blank. As far as I am concerned, it is unacceptable. I feel that Amazon should have stated that this CD was an unlabeled "remake".
5470	If I could give 0, I would . . .: Please read M. Lohrke's review - it says exactly what I would say if I could write as well as M. Lohrke.I would add that I couldn't finish the book. I gave up after the shopping trip fiasco.I would also add that I would strongly discourage my daughters from reading this book (not forbid - because that would probably make them want to read it all the more). It's that crappy.
5471	It's defective when received: The item was shipped via second day shipping(thanks discover card). I took it out of the box and ready to give it a test ( I really need the delayed-timer function it comes with). However, after placing it on the table, it's not flat. ??? then I noticed that the electric board at the bottom of the rice cooker has already fallen out. I tried to put this thing back myself and was unsuccessful. At the same time I noticed that the bottom has some sign of using. Apparently someone returned it before and Amazon just shipped to me without even taking a look at it! I have been satisfied with Amazon all the time but was disappointed this time really.
5472	Launch the Rocket Men!: This is one of the better Republic serials. It was rewarding to find this set with its adequate visual and audio qualities. I recommend this item to anyone who appreciates the vintage movie serials.
5473	Serial Number Help: I recently changed over from a PC to latest iMAC. Transferring software for this product I found a prompt for a serial number. However I had long since thrown the packaging. Reading general customer comments on the web I found a lot of negative press for Data Color help desk and complaint that customers could not get the serial number. However my experience was very good. I got a quick response, you just need to quote them the number on the USB plug. Calibration worked great!
5474	Roma: Esta serie es increible, te sientas y no puedes dejar de verla. La recomiendo altamente. Es una de las mejores series jamás hechas.Simplemente E X C E L E N T E!!
5475	Not what I expected: I ordered a few of these when our mom died to give to my sisters. After reveiwing it, I still have them all. This book is for women whose mothers passed when they were young and who haven't had a mother to bring them up. That isn't our case as the youngest of us is 46. It did us no good but I'm sure it might help women in that situation.
5476	more buddy romance than zombie movie: The zombie scenes were very short and far between until the very end of movie. It more tried to be a romance and buddy movie which I was not interested in. I wanted a funny zombie movie like Fido or Shaun of the Living Dead. It was disappointing. It more focused on the love story between boy and girl. The few zombie scenes in the first two-thirds of movie were extremely short. We kept wondering when they were going to run into zombies, they went long stretches without any and then they would give us a two minute zombie scene. It had a few funny parts but it felt like they made a romance-buddy film and to add a new dimension, they threw in some zombies. So disappointing, I really wanted another Fido or the like. Now that was hilarious. I am trading in my copy it was so bad.
5477	Great CD.: I'll never understand why Walter Trout isn't as popular here in the US as he is in Europe. He and his band are ultra talented musicians, and really know how to play the blues. This is a great CD.
5478	Kirkbride Still Best Value--: When I purchased another Thompson recently as a gift, I looked at this particular Bible. Unlike the preacher reviewing earlier, I have found Nelson Bibles to be either overpriced or quite lacking in quality. This Bible is of obvious higher quality than their usual line, but nothing to justify Nelson's price. The quality of construction is no better than Kirkbride (Thompson's original publisher) at a much dearer price. I agree with other reviewers that the paper is not of a quality expected for this price range, either.For this price one can buy two Kirkbrides, one to keep and one to give. My oldest Kirkbride Thompson is nearly 30 years old and is still in regular use. It's the only 'daily' Bible I've got that age that hasn't required a re-binding!
5479	Drum'n'Bass mates with Acid Jazz: A great cd for fans who love strong deep vocals mix with down tempo drum'n' bass, with a jazz twist. Lenny Laws, Roni Size, and Dj Die are the trio behind this album. If you like Tricky and Portishead, then pick this cd up.
5480	Greene with Envy: The cover of Roger Penrose's The Road To Reality looks alot like this book by Brian Greene, viz. The Fabric of The Cosmos. I was invited to write a review of Penrose's book, but I have not yet finished reading it. Besides, I was excited at the prospect of adding my two cents to the stack of opinions about Greene's book, and all I have to say about it is that it is the book I would have loved to have written. The Elegant Universe was pretty good, but The Fabric of The Cosmos is superlative. It is extremely informative and very entertaining. It is a masterpiece.
5481	Loved It: I brought this for myself and love it, It arrived within days of me placing order price was great too
5482	Waste of money!: Looks like everyone says the same thing... After just one use of this hose, it developed a huge hole on the back side (not the side with the holes)... So now it cannot be used at all because the force of the water coming out this huge hole will dig a huge hole in my flower bed... I DO NOT recommend this product!
5483	Trailer Hitch: Bought this for my son in law last year. He has been enjoying it on the back of his truck. He doesn't leave it on all the time. Afraid someone might steal it off the truck. It is cute and makes people smile.
5484	Awful: The drive came unformatted and unaccessable. The OS (XP) read that it was there but it was completely useless. Very similar to many others around the web that have purchased this product before.
5485	NO GH KH tests, bad description: The description clearly states that this kit has these two water hardness tests included and it definitely does not. All the other tests are great but if you are like me and really wanted those two tests you will be disappointed. There is another review that states this, wish I had read that ....
5486	Did not receive what I paid for.: I paid for a new, never before used item, but received a used set. A few of the discs were even damaged. I am very disappointed.
5487	Don't buy!: I'm an able bodied guy in my 20's, this product is very difficult to use, one needs 3 hands! The 'Cable Zipper' is made of too rigid plastic for fingers and breaks fingernails and the 'Zip Clip' is too weak (thin plastic and pathetic action) to slide along even my thin flimsy cables that I wanted to 'tidy'. The worst item I've ever bought on Amazon!
5488	Same old Same old: More of the same as far as thrillers go. Pretty much figured it out quite early on. I was looking for something a bit more deep. After "The Game" and "Unbreakable" it's pretty hard for thrillers to compare. Save the silly trite endings for cable TV. Jodi Foster must have done this one to get a better role in something else. If this film blows you away then you have not seen much. Other than her decent performance the film was lame.
5489	Bought for the concert footage: I bought this for the concert footage. It had been posted on YouTube at one time, but removed for copyright reasons. Were it not for that, I'd never have even found out who Redd Volkaert is -- all the sudden, now, I like Country.Anyways, the band is tight and the guitar work is excellent. And Cindy Cashdollar on steel is a special treat.I can't comment on the instructional material at this point ... i haven't even looked at it. I wonder if it will come across on bass??
5490	Didn't live up to my expectations: I read this book with great expectations of learning how to take advantage of online auctioning. However, after reading this 74 page book (which has size 14 font and is tripled spaced), I don't feel I've gained any knowledge that wasn't based on common sense. I feel cheated for having paid $14.95 on information that is provided free of charge on the eBay site. Also, seeing as the author of the book is the only one to "strike it rich" on this deal, he could have paid a few bucks to have someone edit it for spelling and grammar errors. At least I didn't get a paper cut.
5491	A must read for anyone who aspires to live better: While I find most food writing, particularly autobiographies, tiring to the core this book warmed my jaded little heart.It's hard not to love Julia Child, but when I got this book I was hardly expecting to come away from it not only satisfied with geeky details of her life but also inspired to explore food fearlessly.The story never bogs down in sentimentality. The prose is tight and focused and the tone is so perfect you can almost hear Juilia's shrill voice recounting meals in Provence.Few things I have read have made me want to not only cook but look at food as a philosophy of life.I have come away from this book changed for the better and I think that is the best thing any author can hope for.
5492	great: every person should see this..it was awesome it opened my eyes to how mt body reacts to certain things. even men should see this
5493	Waiting for the movie!: This book is touching, nostalgic, humorous, intelligent, and frightening. Well, maybe the "monster" here is not quite that scary (if you're past puberty) and the ending is a little anti-climactic.. but if you can put yourself in the shoes of these kids ( a group remniscient of the kids in King's It or The Body), you can feel their fear and experience the struggles of the kids. The characters are diverse and many humorous, and if you have relatives from small towns, you could even recognize your town here.. the picture woven by Simmons is very vivid. Great book, ought to be a great movie.
5494	Super cute pictures: This book is perfect for introducing your little one to the many animals and ethnicities of the world.
5495	Fast Action: The EP-3E Aries reconnaissance plane makes a cameo appearance in this book, as the instigator of the entire plot line. The action picks up with two F/A-18 Hornets hiding under its wings, and barely slows down for the rest of the 400 pages. The Blue Angel flying details seem plausible enough, but that kind of plane isn't my specialty. I didn't have any trouble suspending my disbelief through most of the story. We see inter-agency distrust and squabbling; we see power struggles at all levels of bureaucracy; we see special forces members saving the day nearly single-handedly. I found the action and plot quite engaging and will definitely pick up a few other books by this author.
5496	Naomi Watts' Performance is Unbelievably Impressive: Mulholland Drive is creepy as hell and beautiful to look at.Some will enjoy the music, the colors, the lighting, the pacing etc.Others will enjoy Naomi Watts incredible performance where she has to convey the full spectrum of human emotion.Think about it...the first part of the movie she plays a perky, naive idealist and by the end of the movie she is equally impressive as a burnt out, suicidal depressive. Anyone who has ever acted can tell you how hard that is to do in the same film.This is one of Lynch's best films. It is filled with unforgettable scenes (Club Silencio, The audition, The casting meeting with the director and the mobsters).This is one of those films that will stay in your head.
5497	Less than a year and it is broken: So disappointing. Less than a year and it broke. I don't use it than often, just like every couple of months. I don't give it one star because when it was working it worked pretty good.
5498	Buyer Beware!: This CD has remakes of the original songs by the original artists. They are not as good as the original recordings by a long shot.
5499	This is a killer album!: For those of you who have tracked Mike Watt since the days of the Minutemen, this album is a pleasant reminder yet it holds a completely different sound. Mike Watt is a bass prodigy, as was evident with the Minutemen. On this album he teamed up with his wife (now ex, I believe) and brings soulful bass melodies together with a beautifull voice. This album has a very unpolished feel to it, but that is what makes it so special. It gives me the feeling of kicking back in the living room after a long day, and listening to your buddies sing some tunes. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for an unusual branch of jazz/blues/punk.
5500	Didn't really Like It ! concept album???????: This is definitely not the very best of Rush albums particularly after you have listened to Moving Pictures or Exit stage left. Also,this is supposed to be a concept album. A piece of suggestion to my friend in the review section (ssbl@geocities.com) as he has asked for it.Why not try concept albums by Jethro tull. eg 1.Aqualung 2.Thick as a Brick 3.A passion Play 4. Minstrel in the Gallery in particular and most other 60's and 70's albums by Jethrotull and you will appreciate what it means to make a concept album.Also you could try albums by King Crimson eg 1.In the court of King Crimson 2.lizard. After listening to the above albums you will understand how shoddy this album is.
5501	Zero stars: I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this.I thought IBM cared about its reputation, but evidently not.It looks like they had some drunk intern just slap a bunch of slidesinto a book. I suspect that the slides came from several different presentations, because they make no sense.Save yourself some time and just flush the money down thetoilet instead of buying this book.
5502	Kindle Users Beware!: This book was not formatted for the Kindle. I have other chess tactics/puzzle books for the Kindle and they are formatted with the problem on one page and the answer on the next. "Looking for Trouble" has the answer on the same page as the problem! I'm considering returning the book. I could make it usable by having something ready with which to cover the screen when I hit <next page>, but even then there's no way to know exactly how far up or down the answer will be because the amount of introductory text varies from problem to problem. I'm a fan of Mr. Heisman. I enjoy his on-line columns and find them useful, but this book, formatted as it is, will be at best a pain to use and at worst useless. I may update this review in the future to indicate which tactics books ARE formatted correctly.
5503	No very entertaining: This by far is the worst Pirates of the Caribbean movie. The writing really stunk. Very good acting by Johnny Depp but he can't carry the movie alone. Wish i wouldn't have bought it!Fast shipping and Amazon prices are hard to beat though!
5504	One for the Dimmu & Emperor fans: This is the 2002 first full-length album from these Brazilian Black Metallers (They had a couple of demos before and have released a second album since).This is one of those albums that I knew nothing about and picked up solely because I thought the cover art looked cool, the song titles sounded interesting and the used price was right.I wouldn't say this album is exactly bad, but it's just not my idea of what Black Metal should be like. But if you're a fan of bands with more of a keyboard sound like Dimmu Borgir or Emperor, I'd say that this album is fairly decent and might be worthwhile checking out. -- Especially if you can pick it up cheap used like I did. (Hey, anybody want mine?)
5505	Like liver and fava beans with Ripple - not a fine Chianti: Having anticipated another chapter in the Lector story for years, and having re-read SOtL and Red Dragon, I was thrilled to see "Hannibal" on the bookstands. I was ready to be equally thrilled by the book. Wrong! Parts of the book were masterfully written, but the last chapter was disappointment writ large. In the name of character development, Dr. Lecter was raised to the level of superman. Krendler was a cartoon, as were most of the other characters. I don't need a happy ending, but I do need one that is plausible and fits the sense of the story. Wrong again! Compared to the previous two books in the series, this is tabloid journalism.
5506	Thai Instant Coffee: I purchased this product in the hope of being able to make Thai Iced Coffee at home without the need of going to a Thai restaurant to purchase it. It didn't taste anything like restaurant Thai Iced Coffee. The absence of cardamon, a key ingredient in Thai Iced Coffee, was evident. It tastes more like a poor-quality mocha latte. The only positive thing I can say is that it wasn't as sweet as restaurant Thai Iced Coffee, which I always dilute with milk. Anyway, I didn't like it; but it was worth the try.
5507	Denon - BAD DOG: After seeing the disgraceful overpricing of this generously $10 cable, I looked at Denon's own website.I'm not sure whether they're living up to their motto:"Simply put, anything that does not provide more passion, improve performance or enhance the user experience does not belong in a Denon."If they don't take these off the market, I will never look at a Denon anything again. Period. As consumers, we should make it a point to not be swindled and have our intelligence insulted. That said, some idiots probably just needed to be shown the dotted line. They deserve their fate.
5508	Bad Microphone.....Great Game--<<Kids Review>>--: Me and my friend loved this game and we played all the time...we only had the one microphone(that came with the game). And then we stopped playing. And about a week later we tried playing it again and the microphone was all messed up... it would miss like half the notes like it was turning on and off.AWESOME game i think i just got a bad mic.
5509	Brenner's autobiography of food: Tries to summarize how Americans in the past century have learned to eat better, but could more accurately be called an autobiography. Most of her stories are anecdotal. She summarizes the influence of Julia Child's publishing of a French cookbook in the 60's, Alice Waters' emphasis on fresh ingredients in the 70's, and tons of anecdotes about the effect of an ethnic cooking boom in the 80s and 90s. But no real analysis of any of this. She cites Kellogg and the "Food Science" movement of the early 1900s as a reason for the public acceptance of poor tasting food, but there's no real analysis, nor is there anything other than sketchy hearsay about a rise in the quality and variety of the rest of the food Americans eat. Also would have been nice to objectively compare us to other countries a bit: maybe the French are eating better today too?
5510	Excellent Series: It must be said, I thought this series was going to be another CGI failure.However, I decided to give it a chance, and now I am hooked! You can tell this show has a lot of talent working on it. From the excellent writing and staging to the gorgeous animation and color work, GLTAS is a series worth indulging in. The characters are believable [a key trait in animation]. The voice acting is splendid. The quality is spectacular for a computer-animated television show. I highly recommend this series to anyone, even those who have no previous knowledge of the Green Lantern universe [like myself].As for the product, the DVDs were well worth purchasing. Very good quality and packaging. I do hope, though, that the full season is released on Blu-ray once the episodes are aired. Would love to see the series in all its HD glory!
5511	Straightman: How about not putting anything on your website without a description?Does that make any sense?Duh.
5512	The limit is not 5 years old!: We got one of these for our two year old. I thought my wife was going to wear it out before it was wrapped-up! We have a 2, 4 and 9 year old, and they all love it. They all play with it in different ways. It's so flexible that it is entertaining for each of the kids (and for Mom and Dad too).The other cartridges are nice, but not an absolute necessity. You'll probably want at least one more though, for some more variety. We have two and are getting a third for the 2 year old for christmas, but I think my wife might be getting it for herself. :)
5513	product GREAT, COMPany Selling has FALSE advertising!!!: This item is described by "Beauty Encounter" as a 6 pack of Arimis lab series mens comfort shave cream for $22.00 ( normaly 28.00. It states that it comes to 3.67 per jar. 3.67 X's 6 = 22.02. I received one (1) jar. FALSE ADVERTISING. I tried to call numerous time and you hold for about 5 minutes then get a message saying they are too busy to take call & to leave a message. I left a number of messages and NO ONE called back. I spoke to AMAZON, they agree it is advertised as a 6 pack of shave cream.They told me I had to call the company selling thru AMAZON.
5514	One Bag For All Your Needs -- ALMOST: The photos on Amazon don't really give you an idea just how big a bag this is. I've got all my camera gear in there, five lenses, one Canon Digital Rebel, flash, and, in addition to my laptop, I also lug around a 300 GB external hard drive. As you might imagine, this thing gets a bit heafty to carry (not something you'd want on your back while hiking), and despite all the space to accommodate so much equipment, I still had to purchase some attachments for the one thing I think they didn't plan for when designing this bag -- power cords for your laptop. The laptop compartment is just big enough to squeeze in your laptop -- and that's it. As for protection, the bag is well padded and my camera, lenses, laptop, etc. all seem very secure. This is my second Tamrac bag, replacing a 20-year-old over-the-shoulder pro model, so I know Tamrac bags are durable, hold up to snow and rain, and keep your expensive equipment safe. Finally, I definitely like the backpack design.
5515	BAD Track Listing for Teen Idols CD: THIS IS A REVIEW OF YOUR BAD ONLINE LISTING FOR THIS CD.The CD is supposed to have Avalon/Valens/Fabian. But your track listing HAS NO VALENS. Also the existing Customer Review seems to be for some CD other than the one listed.YOU SHOULD FIX THE LISTING
5516	What is wrong with you people?????: Avril Lavigne has a great voice. It was that combined with the radio version of Complicated that got me to buy this album, and God do I wish I had bought the single. Her friends on the instruments are basically terrible. The songs themselves make it well known that Avril idealizes Alanis (and I actually like Alanis quite a bit) since she constantly tries to sing in Alanis's style. The band and the style are a big mistake, hunny. Get some good musicians and sing your own way cause your voice is awesome. as far as the lyrics go, are you all fourteen? I can't believe how so many of you who reviewed this album said you could identify with her songs. I'll admit I like Complicated, but even with that song, only the radio remix (which improves on the instrumental ten fold) is worth listening to. When she looses the band and grows up a little she'll be awesome, but this album sucks. If you want to hear Complicated buy the single cause this album will only disappoint.
5517	Dont buy it: waste of money it shows the same moves over and over. Not worth it I'm sure that there are better belly dancing videos out there. Also that hip hop drop is also a con
5518	Product still gets 5 stars!: I also received my set with a broken piece, but Amazon was more than gracious in replacing it with no cost to me. There is definitely a packaging problem, but I cannot say the same for the actual product. The Corningware is multi-functional and in french white, very stylish. This stuff lasts forever and takes quite a bit of abuse!
5519	Not What I Expected: First of all, these songs are all remakes, and not very good ones at that. Second, where did anyone get the idea that "Macho Man", "Let's Go Dancin'", and "Disco Inferno" are Halloween songs? All in all, I was very disappointed in this cd. Save your money- this is not worth it.
5520	Promising Beginning Turns Into a Joke: The beginning of this movie seemingly sets the stage for a great manhunt type western. A wounded man must survive in the cold wilderness with little more than a knife and all the time being hunted by a relentless and cold pursuer. That's the first ten minutes of this movie.The story and the script just get ridiculous. First of all, I like a good artsy film but it has to make some kind of sense. This movie does not. Second, I think if you are going to get abstract, you need to have some idea of where you are leading people with your abstractions. This movie smacks of having no point other than being abstract, and that means BAD SCRIPT.They keep you in the dark about why this man is pursuing another man to the death for a long time, and when they finally do explain it with a clumsy flashback, the flashback is a corny, sentimental disappointment which could have been better done by a grade school class play.Skip this movie or watch it for a laugh.
5521	Wonderful worship with Robin Mark: Revival in Belfast II is a wonderful worship experience. Mark has a gift for bringing his listeners into the presence of God to worship our God with music.
5522	Excellent!: I loved this book, I could not put it down. Yes, I would have loved for them to have gotten back together but life doesn't always end that way. It was a gut wrenching ending. I am so glad that I read it!
5523	THE THING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN: This video is indispensible for those who want to remember Metallica as the great band they once were. Featuring bootleg performances of songs from Cliff Burtons days with the band as well as photos and rare footage CLIFF EM ALL is the sort of no frills, no BS you got from Metallica before they let everything go to their heads and started releasing mediocre material. Its great to see Dave Mustaine on lead guitar early on. But all Metallica is these days is Kirk Hammett and a couple of middle aged egomaniacs. Sad really. Cliff would be turning in his grave.
5524	More of the same, which isn't altogether a bad thing.: Artemis Fowl - The Eternity Code is the third Artemis Fowl book.This is clearly a teen book and not aimed at adults, but I discovered it on a list of books for "those who were going through Harry Potter withdrawals."It isn't Harry Potter by any stretch of the imagination. And it isn't perfect. But it is very readable and with the exception of the over-the-top dwarf character (Mulch Diggums) it is constructed well enough that the story is fun and surprising.I found the second book in the series slightly more enjoyable than the first. This one was good as well, but "killing" characters that do not end up dead at the end of the book is becoming a bit of a literary crutch for Mr. Colfer.I've read through the third book now and have ordered the fourth. They are not great works of art, but certainly readable and worth buying.
5525	Just the basics. No mention of reloading strategies.: Clearly written examples take you through the basics. The discussion of Alternative Minimum Tax considerations is too small. In the description it claims the book will tell you "why it may take a long time to claim the AMT credits" but the text devoted to that is very limited. The practice of "reloading" is not even mentioned in this book. Hey, maybe I should write a book on reloading strategies???
5526	Great product: Although I did not purchase these directly from Amazon this time around because I found them cheaper on Ebay, I have to still write a review since I saw some saying negative about these...The ones I purchased were all in Chinese language instructions except for the tabs on the protective film.However the pictures were pretty self explanatory.Just remember to clean your psp screen with some eye glass cleaner and a lint free cloth first.Then apply by removing tab marked one and place this surface down on the psp...As you apply you can gently press your finger or use the card board piece they give to you to smooth out the air bubbles if any occur.Once its in place then remove the top piece by pulling on Tab 2.I had no problem applying it and you can't even tells its on.Great product.
5527	Faulty DVDs: This distributor is now working on the second try of getting me a functional set of DVDs of the wire. First, the problem was adhesive on the information side of the DVDs and missing DVDS (!). Now, the DVDs are scratched. You're better off going with someone else.
5528	Great introductory book: This is a super book for anyone looking to get a quick introduction the the basics of art history. It also has beautiful picture pages.
5529	WHY?: This record does nothing for any of these stellar artists. It's stale. Nor does it contribute to the soul music cannon. Or any cannon. Hey.. I've got an idea, lets get a bunch of great artists, bang a few tunes on them that they wouldn't normally sing, keep the recording production down. I'm sorry...I like every one involved with this record but we don't need this. It's like a bad sitcom staring great actors. The tracks are all pedestrian. I do not endorse this record.
5530	Get the Ultimate Edition: I remember debating on which movie to get - the Extreme version or the Ultimate edition. Since I don't have an adequate computer to play the hi-def scenes on the Extreme Version 2nd DVD, I think I would have liked the Ultimate edition better. From the trailer of the Ultimate edition shown in this DVD, I think there is a much larger variety of information about the movie in the Ultimate Edition than the Extreme Edition.
5531	SLAUGHTERED DVD!!!: I was so excited that the dvd was coming out, so I rented it and I was very unsatisfied of the poorly job they gave this classic movie...VHS-to-DVD, no widescreen, just like other great films like Fright Night part 2. Shame on Lionsgate, they might as well not even released it at all!!! I'll just keep my dvd-r, tell you the truth I think my dvd-r has better sound and picture to tell you the truth. If you already have this on dvd-r, do not buy the new one.Just a waste of your money.
5532	You won't believe this - new material not "compatible" with the Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer 2.0 (Possibly the 5000 as well): I know it sounds crazy, but I couldn't figure out why none of my Microsoft Wireless Intellimouse 2.0 mice were not working anymore. (Tried four of them) I happen to set the mouse on my desk and saw the cursor move.. ah-ha! It was the mouse pad.I absolutely love these Belkin ergo pads and usually replace all of ours yearly. I just replaced our last year's pads and it seems the new material that works great for all our other mice, just doesn't work with the "Microsoft Wireless Intellimouse 2.0"These were purchased Mid November 2010.I put my last year's Belkin pad for the computer using that mouse and I'm good to go. Otherwise, they are perfect!
5533	Reliable: Have been using this pedometer model for 4 yrs with no problems. It is very durable. But I unfortunately lost my original pedometer two months ago, bought a replacement, and only lost 1.5 days worth of data. Highly recommend this pedometer as a reliable device that will accurately monitor your daily activities.
5534	The Last One - Enjoy: Unfortunetly, Mr. Glueck passed away last year. This was hisfirst book and while everyone was looking forward to it'ssequel, we'll have to be content with just this one book.
5535	A Book Never to be Forgotten: I am in awe, and at the same time not at all surprised, to find that others who have been touched by this book have searched for it through the years. I can clearly remember when and where it appeared in our tiny school library in the late 1950's. That night, I knew that I had discovered a rare treasure. I truely long to read it again - this story is altogether too timeless to languish out-of-print!
5536	Gotta be honest: I've been a Bone fan for 12 years and Bizzy's first 3 solos are classics in my opinion. However, all of the fears that Speaking In Tongues brought to my mind were confirmed by this release. I still think that Bizzy's a uniquely talented and spiritual man, but he seems to have surrounded himself with wack producers and low expectations. The repetative hooks and sparse verses are particularly disappointing.
5537	Have I read this somewhere before?: I am from Mississippi and went to school at Ole Miss, so, I am supposed to love John Grisham's books. I used not be able to wait until the next book came out.I find his books to all be cut from the same cloth. What happened to the great suspense books like The Firm and The Pelican Brief? It seems to me that Mr. Grisham is losing his passion for writing. Much like the main character in this book, I think that Mr. Grisham is just trying to produce a story fast enough to meet a deadline set by his publisher and just good enough to pass the minimum requirements needed to sell a few copies.In a nutshell, Mr. Grisham's books are becoming steadily worse. My advice--don't waste your time reading this book.
5538	Address book works well: This address book works well for us, allowing for extra inserts as our contacts increase. It's nice and low tech and it suits our need.
5539	Not as good as I hoped...: The cover of this book is unlike any I've seen in a long time, which is what drew me to it. I have to admit though, it was a hard book to get through. I didn't want to finish it, although I was at least interested enough to find out what would happen at the end. The story was sort of all over the place time wise, and all in all, I would not recommend this one.
5540	worse album ever: this album is wack the only 2 songs on here i like is1 nothing even matters2 ex factory but other then that i was so diappointed when i bought this album 8 years ago i was salty this is the worse album i ever bought in my life besides whats the 411 by mary j blige
5541	The Ego That Ate Eatonton: After the two readings it took for me to figure out the probable point of this book, I finally determined this is the author's attempt to finally get to be the "big man in town" he has never been in life. He portrays everyone else in Eatonton as either stupid, incompetent or completely morally bankrupt. The only person, other than himself, admired by "Frank Moss" apparently was his foul-talking preacher. Everyone desperately needed this hero to save them - from themselves, I guess. What I can't figure out is whether this author really thinks that much of himself or whether he is so ego-starved that he needs this fix. Sad.
5542	Interesting story!: Interesting story! As expected, it is beautifully filmed, the dialogue is convincing and the actresses are wonderfull - like other Sarah Waters stories. The actresses do a wonderful job in displaying love for one another, despite the lack of love scenes between them. I Really enjoyed the twist in this one, very unexpected! I give it a 4 however, because the end was a bit disappointing. I agree with the previous reviewer in that if you like happy endings movies, this one will likely dissapoint. Overall though, I though it was a very good movie and worth a look.
5543	Pleased :): Arrived in good condition :) This is actually a x-mas gift for my mom; she's wanted this thing for a long time now but it's so expensive (still spendy no matter where u buy it from but Amazon has got the best price on it ;) that she would never buy it for herself (keeping w/ tradition, she'll never have to spend a dime to get it! LOL!).Chump change won't buy you Staub but it's still a lower price point & a slightly higher quality v. Le Creuset. Le Creuset still makes awesome products & use to be the leader but now they've got REAL competition in Staub!
5544	A bit flimsy, but good for backyard fun: I bought two of these nets for my daughters for use in the backyard. I've only had them about a week, but here are my thoughts:- A bit on the flimsy side. My kids are young (<6 years), so they will be fine. I can see these being too flimsy for older kids though.- Stakes are useless. My backyard has some rocky soil. Almost all of the stakes bent when I tried securing the nets. And the ones that didn't bend didn't stay in the ground long.- Easy to put together. I had both of them together in under an hour.- Velcro net attachments. These made assembly pretty easy, but we'll see how they hold up.Overall, I would recommend these for young kids in the backyard.
5545	Hilarious idea, poor turn-out: Anger Management (2003) Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson, Marisa Tomei, Luis Guzman, Lynne Thigpen, John Turturro, Nancy Walls, D: Peter Segal. Redefines the phrase "odd couple": Sandler as an even-tempered businessman (who never sticks up for himself) is wrongly sentenced to an anger management session and Nicholson is his eccentric instructor who turns out to be more aggressive than him. One-joke screwball comedy had a good premise, not as funny as the critics quote it to be, better yet Sandler is less obnoxious than his actual persona inquires. Here, Nicholson is a real galling devil, and genuine comedy would come out of watching him convey his anger at a Laker's game. Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani give cameos. Running Time: 106 minutes and rated PG-13 for crude sexual content and language.
5546	Christmas at the lounge: Neil takes on Christmas with over emotional vocals and covers artists whose originals are far superior to his takes on the tunes. This was not a good idea. Lennon's "Happy Christmas?" "Silver Bells" with a country twang. (Did he listen to the lyrics?) The best tunes are his one contribution ("You Make It Feel Like Christmas") and a few old chestnuts that really resist major damage ("Jingle Bell Rock" "Little Drummer Boy") I was surprised it took Neil this long to put out a Christmas CD. It wasn't worth the wait.
5547	Very good product: Great way to save on batteries! This flashlight is powerful enough for basic household use, and charge lasts about an hour. I was able to use it as reading lamp at night for a satisfying experience both with respect of charge and luminosity. I like this type of products that can rightfully claim they save you money. I only wish the build was less "plastic-y" (they do feel cheap in the hand) and with a retractable hook or ability to attach string to suspend near the bed.
5548	GREAT COLOR, SOUND AND STORY!: For those of you that don't remember the episode titles here they are spread out over four discs:Disc One1. The Quest2. Dishonor3. Break Up4. Betrayal5. VictoryDisc Two6. Andorus7. A Drop of Darkness8. The Beast and the Bell9. Panacea10. King NiddlerDisc Three11. The Collection12. The Little Leviathan13. The Darkdweller14. The Dark Disciples15. The Ghost Pirates16. The Dragon MasterDisc Four17. The Game Players of Undaar18. The Pandawa Plague19. Sister of the Sword20. The Soul Stealer21. The Living TreasureEach episode is 22 minutes because there are no commercials.I also have "Thundarr the Barbarian the Complete Series" for sale.
5549	Command & Conquer 3:Tiberium Wars Kane Edition: I will make this Quick, and simple. I you like C&C; games you will love this one. If you have never played a C&C; game, and like a games where you start with a small force, and you have to build a base, and your forces up, kick your off the map enemy you will love this game. I think it's a must to buy.Command & Conquer 3:Tiberium Wars Kane Edition DVD
5550	It destroyed my registry: -The program caused my computer to shut down. When I rebooted the system this is the message I got:"Your registry settings for this application were not copied correctly. To correct these settings, run setup again for this application from the location where you originally installed it."and the program would not run.I reinstalled the program (repair option) and it still would not run.Apparently Microsoft knows of this condition. I found the procedure to correct the error in the Microsoft self help database. It would have taken me three hours to run their procedure and you have to be a conmputer guru to run the install program in "clean boot" mode.Stay away from this program. DON'T BUY IT. I have reinstalled the 2007 version.Joeph F. HehirRoswell, GA
5551	Doesn't work with the T-mobile SDA: Thought I'd take a shot and try it with my SDA. Sound only comes out of one channel.
5552	Another consistently fine effort from Nolo: This was a very useful book in explaining social security disability benefits to me and written well enough that I was able to explain key concepts to interest members in my family.Well done.
5553	Wireless is off by default. Cannot be unlocked without connecting.: My wired ethernet port died and I needed to get some critical work done. The wireless LAN is off by default and cannot be activated without first connecting to the router through the ethernet or using an indirect method of establishing a WPA key with a USB memory stick. Although I received a message saying the installation via the USB memory stick was successful, the router did not appear in my list of wireless networks, nor did it when I attempted to power cycle the router. Attempts to connect to the ethernet LAN port after purchasing a new PCMCIA were unsuccessful (I used a straight-thru cable). I then purchased a NetGear router and I was able to configure through the ethernet without any problems. Having set up 15 brands/models of wireless routers, this was by far the most frustrating and unpleasant experience I've had.
5554	Miracle of Candeal: This film, created by Fernando Trueba is a masterpiece of cultural recognition.It is amazing how African American traditions are searching for spaces to have visibility and voiceI thank Amazon for giving me the opportunity to purchase such a valuable item
5555	Mr. Clancy has lost his touch: Can I have my money back, Mr. Clancy? When I bought this book, I thought it would be thrilling, like your other books.I am sorry to say that I actually read the thing to the end. I kept wondering when you'd bring the "loose end" of the plot back in. You just left it hanging.The plot is just a story about hit men. After being recruited, the younger generations of the Ryan clan go to a city. There, they murder someone they suspect of being evil. Then they go to another city and murder the next guy. And so on. They even have a magic weapon that is undetectable, so there is little chance that they will get caught. In the mean time they make small talk about fast cars. Even the "local flavor" of the exotic locations is boringly off.
5556	Good Movie: Events unfold completely out of order. However, there are enough evidence left to connect all the parts together. Great movie
5557	Great book for My Students Learning English and Arabic!: This book is fun, cute, and not too hard to read for those learning to read English and/or Arabic. What a thrill to see Jean Simmons put her books out there for Bilingual students! Great going, Jean! Thanks for allowing students to continue developing their literacy in one or more languages!
5558	Samurai Jack Movie: While I am not a fan, my youngest son thoroughly enjoys this character. He will receive this gift in a few days for Christmas. I'm sure it will be among his favorite gifts.
5559	bushnell binoculars: I purchased 4 of them....all crap! Inner lenses are all cracked and fogged. Very dissatisfied with this purchase. Waste of money
5560	Bread hook jams into appliance: If you are going to purchase this, be sure to have a 15mm thin wrench. You will need it to remove the bread hook. As the machine kneads the dough, the nut on the attachment tightens. The plastic splashguard to protect the nut and shaft from getting dirty also makes it really difficult to use a normal wrench to loosen the nut. A really poor design. The Cuisinart staff was totally unhelpful. As someone else stated, the warranty is useless, mail in service only and user pays shipping both ways. This thing is huge and would cost a fortune to ship.
5561	Terrible, terrible product and evidently not made by "Sharp": I bought this travel alarm at Target. It was shoddy from the outset, but for $10 I managed to use it despite the dim display and tinny alarm for one trip. Then I realized the battery only lasts a few weeks. I would have spent more on batteries than the clock itself in the first year. It also began to literally pull apart at the seams. I mailed the clock to Sharp's corporate headquarters in NJ with my complaint and received a letter back saying it wasn't one of their products even though it clearly says "Sharp" right on the front. So either they are lying and producing terrible products or they are not protecting their trademark and allowing other companies to manufacture shoddy products and market them with the Sharp name. Either way I could never buy a product with the Sharp name on it again.... how could I ever be sure if it would be backed up by Sharp or not.
5562	Therapy Use: We are using this for weight therapy for our very large autistic son. He is able to wear most of the weight most days and it helps him to have better awareness and not get lost in space and feel overwhelmed.
5563	madden nfl 2004: After playing this game i thought it was so bad. Ive played madden and it got better and better but now it is horable.
5564	"EMO" WITH AN ACTUAL SENSE OF HUMOR: This is an early release from the Flying Nun label, home to such songwriting geniuses as Chris Knox and the other guy from The Tall Dwarves. Apparently, this particular album is out of stock, but I see it all the time in used bins, usually for less than $5. My friend lent me this album last week, and I must've listened to it fifteen times, start to finish- it's utterly brilliant. I wish I could force all the morons who get off on Sunny Day Real Estate to listen to this, so they could see how much better emotive lyrics and music can be when the songwriter doesn't take himself quite so seriously. I'm 25 years old, and, having listened to this kind of stuff for ages, I didn't expect to be so genuinely moved by lyrics about relationships. Buy this album now, wherever you can find it, and you'll see what I mean.
5565	This game is very good and I think you should get it.: I think this game is pretty good. I saw screen shots from Nintendo Power and it think the graphics are very good, and when you fly away the music calms. When you get close to the action the music begins to go with the action. END
5566	Excellent! Waiting for Seasons 2 & 3: I was nearly 10 years old when I watched parts of the three seasons on the national channel (Greece). I was amazed and touched by the cruelty and romance of this 'masterpiece'.Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the quality (in comparison with the TV version) but, sincerely, the series itself is an excellent fairy tale (?) that I wish to have for my children.It is obvious, that I am anxiously looking forward to Seasons 2 &3 on DVD.
5567	Too much fluff: The good parts of this book could be expressed well in about 10 pages. The rest is just hand waving.
5568	"I want to sing about something that is close to me...": These words are words of Patrick Fiori. And I can say it's true, because in this album he decided not to show his vocal advantages with all power that he has. He sings more like an artist than a singer. Please, don't get me wrong: it doesn't mean than you won't hear how beautiful his voice is. He just decided to make this album from another point of view. That's why the title of this album is "Patrick Fiori."Songs: "Sans bruit" and "Si tu revenais" are really dramatically, "Miraval" is very unusual, "Marselle" & "Je sais ou aller" ("I know where to go") are about his origin and his home, etc..It's a pleasure to listen to this album!!!!! I'm sure you won't have any regrets (at least I don't have it :))
5569	Save your money: The idea is, you take these stickers that say F---, stick them on a sign, take a photo, and send it to the guy. He'll put you on his website or maybe even in a book. I guess it's not a bad idea, but unfortunately the execution gives no payoff. Most of the results aren't original, clever, or funny; a 7 year old boy might laugh at it, but adults will be bored by the third page. Something weird--there are a large number of blank pages, making the book look somewhat thicker than the content really is. It's just kind of odd, maybe the guy expected to have more submissions but didn't get them. Or maybe he just realized the pages that do have pictures are a waste of space. Seriously, don't bother.
5570	Too much porn - Yuck !: As is typical from hollywood expect full frontal nudity...yuck !I purchased the film to hopefully watch an action flick not a porn flick.As for the plot. The plots ok but Hal Holbrook is this old guy who keeps comingup with ho-hum platitdes referring to his moralistic ideas of approaches to stock marketinvestment which make one want to throw up.The most interesting true story ever related to stocks is the life story of Jesse Livermore.Livermore was a poor farm boy who left home at 15 with 5.00 his mother gave him.20 years later, after learning to trade, he eventually made 100 million shorting the 1929 crash.Now theres movie potential.
5571	The Accountants: I must say that The Accountants have struck a chord with me, both personally (with My American Dream) and globally (with Executive Comp). The lyrics are catchy and timely, their style is varied and the edge is there. I have made this CD a weekly listen.
5572	Pure frustration: Sometimes it works, and sometimes you have to try many times to get a weight. Accurate when it works. 9v battery receptacle won't release battery and is falling apart--wish it took AA batteries. Concept good--I like the remote, but just plain frustrating to use, if it decides to work that day. Digital remote works about a foot from the platform--also constantly have to reset the scale to get it to read. I am now looking for a better choice of scale--one that works and zeroes faster than 2 minutes--when it works.
5573	3 New Units: Orderd 3 New. 1st one was so dusty and used other 2 were new. They all working okay. But so disappointed paying for brand new and getting one used.
5574	Started Out Interesting: The book started out interesting and you could feel some of what Sam was feeling when she was alone in the house after the divorce and eating Thanksgiving dinner alone. And then King comes along, which even the name makes you envision him as huge. I just couldn't picture her falling in love with a fat guy, no matter how much she was hurt in the past. Her relationship with her son went back and forth so much, him hating her and him actually being nice to her that you just wanted to slap both of them. I would've liked the story better had she stayed by herself. Just another way of telling women that you are nothing without a man.....frankly I'm sick of hearing it.
5575	Lots of Fun!: We bought this toy for our 16 month old twin girls. They absolutely love it! We did have problems with the rim falling off easily at first; but I called Little Tikes and they helped me solve the problem. They told me to take the backboard off, lay it on the floor and attach the hoop and then actually step on the flat part of the hoop until I heard it snap into place. This worked like a charm and the hoop hasn't fallen off since. We all enjoy playing basketball. Little Tikes has great toys and their customer service folks are really helpful if there's ever a problem.
5576	good price: Very good price for this popular style; quick delivery; as promisedquality may not be quite as good as previous ones but still servicable
5577	Great thriller: This is the first book I`ve read that I did not have the ending already pegged. It had a great twist in the end. And Mercy has a tough decision ahead of her. Will it be Adam or Samuel.? HOW much longer can she survive around these wolves and vampires. On to the next book!!!!
5578	Dissappointing Tech support: I bought this device about 3 months ago. Since then, the built-in speaker stopped working, and I have sound to the earphones on one channel only. I tried to contact tech support, but so far unsuccessful: The website provides a number to call, but it always says that "all circuits are busy". I also sent an email, but no response. Unless they improve their support I cannot recommend these devices.
5579	Everybody wants a Gershwin song: I jsut love George Gershwin.. Many people do. Recently at the education facility I attend there was a little fracas because someone did a Gershwin medley already aware that someone else was to do it>. I have to say nothing beats the original..
5580	Too long: I know every chapter is designed to build momentum for the final battle but... i don't know it could be a little bit shorter, not that i have a problem but i'm just saying. Overall a great book like the ones before.
5581	A very well thought out and recommendable book!: This book is wonderful! I would be willing to read it over and over. I would suggest, however, that you be prepared to feel for the characters. . . I was heartbroken for Jesse, and happy for his little sister.
5582	Good Text - Horrible Diagrams: The actual text of this book is decent but constantly refers the reader to diagrams that actually confuse more than help. It's a good start but not enough.
5583	Good book for internalizing patterns: Came across this book while searching our library, for design help, in the middle of a design review cycle.I have read many books on Design Patterns. The issue is that most of them do not help you internalize the patterns you learned. Most of them just explain the patterns.By internalizing being able to "trace back" from an object design problem to a pattern. The only three books that helped me internalize the more complex design patterns are Head First Design Patterns, Patterns in Java and this book.I liked the author's writing style and presentation. The drawbacks of this book ? It does not cover all the design patterns. This books brings out the core concept of Design Patterns, which is "Protected Variations".Would I recommend this book to a novice in Object Oriented Technology ? No. One has to be familiar with OOA and OOD to appreciate and internalize the value of Design patterns.
5584	What a DOWNER: In a good mood?? Hate that feeling?? Then read this book by all means. (POSSIBLE SPOILER)I'm not sure what the other reviews mean by "a story of redemption" The main character is a back-stabber who, although supposedly haunted by his past bad decisions, keeps making more bad decisions! He is interested in helping no one more than himself. I don't see where he ever succeeds on his own at anything. Living in Afghanistan in relative opulence?- thanks Dad! Leaving it?- thanks Dad! Getting his life saved?- thanks, Kid! Working out the adoption?-thanks relative in the INS! Oh yeah, he did succeed on his own at one thing- he turned that kid into a mute.Although well written and a quick read, I can't recommend this to anyone.
5585	Lid broke after 2 months: This is junk. I bought this item on June 15, 2012, and on Aug 10, 2012 I went to refill it when it was empty. I tried to pick it up from the ground by the handle, the whole upper part of the lid was cracked and went off. The waterer has always been standing on the ground and never hung by the handle. I didn't carry it full by the handle either. The lid is made of some sort of crappy plastic which just cracks on its own. $40 down the drain for me.
5586	Could have been better: I had decided to read this book for a book report a while ago. I was mostly inspired by the original plot to read it, however, I was disappointed by the rushed writing and lack of descriptions of characters and locations. Throughout the book, even the main character does not have a distinct age, physical appearance, or personality (unless you own the paperback copy with her on the cover). And although she does have the power of clairvoyance, most of the story is way too predictable. I would recommend this for young children who do not see such points as important, but for older readers, though, I think you should pass this one up.
5587	A GREAT REMINDER OF A GREAT MAN.: "Sweetness: The Courage and Heart of Walter Payton" is a wonderful collection of quotes, stats, stories, and pictures illustrating the complete Payton. He was indeed one of the greatest running-backs of all time. What this book gives, that many don't, is a review of Walter's off-field perfomances. He was kind, caring, and loving to all. This book clearly shows that Walter was in all aspects.....a hero. This title is a must for all those who miss the headbands, the dives over the goal lines, the amazing runs, the jumping high fives, and a great man----SWEETNESS!
5588	DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY!: I TRIED THIS PRODUCT WHICH WAS PURCHASED AT A LOCAL SPORTS SHOP AND IT SUCKS! YOUR OWN SPIT WORKS BETTER AS A DEFOGGER THAN THIS CRAP. IF YOU WANT A GOOD CHEAP SOLUTION TO A SNORKEL MASK DEFOGGER, BUY THE J&J BABY SHAMPOO NO TEARS FORMULA. IT WORKS WELL! PROBABLY JUST AS WELL AS ANY OTHER EXPENSIVE DEFOGGER OUT THERE.
5589	crack piston: I replace my old caliper with this one about a month I decide to check may brakes-what do you know the piston was cracked.I will not buy another centric caliper.
5590	Trip down memory lane: I purchased this to read and reminisce, and Bill Watterson hits the spot. I'll read this book until the day I die.
5591	Can I give it six stars?: This is a well produced DVD for those who follow rock guitar virtuosos (Vai, Malmsteen, Petrucci, Morse, Zaza). Satriani plays his greatest compositions (until Engines of Creation) supported by three outstanding musicians. Every dollar that you pay for this DVD, is worth it, since it is almost four hours of music with great close-ups to learn some riffs and tricks from the master and an interesting bass solo from Stew Hamm. Contrary to the tradition of this kind of DVD's, the additional features are OK and you will enjoy it more every time you watch it.
5592	Extremely Satisfied: I bought both the salt and the pepper grinders and couldn't be more satisfied. The light is extremely helpful to see the amount of salt and pepper being ground.
5593	Give me a Break: One thing that continually irks me is peoples attacks on "Michael Moore" the person. They try and attack him on where he lives, what he looks like and of course the views he holds. Why would you speak ill upon the person. Argue the adverse of his points. Find the views he believes in and defend reasoning on the argument opposing him. The problem is, can't really do that since he actually defends his points. Hmm.. well, at least he's an easy target to attack, so even if he's saying the truth, it doesnt really matter - It's Michael Moore, noones going to listen unless their a stupid liberal, right? Give me a break.
5594	Nothing "universal" about it.: I bought this item thinking that it was a good idea and it is in theory. The biggest problem is that the "universal" attachment is just a velcro strap to tighten the connection but it doesn't actually work against the blowing force of the vacuum. So, I found that I had to constantly hold the harness provided and it was much more uncomfortable than holding the unit by the handle. I have a Black and Decker Blower/Vac so I think I will return this one and try the one specific to my Brand.
5595	DJ in L.A.: I've been a mobile DJ for over 20 years and have always relied on a good pair of headphones for mixing my music. I recently upgraded to laptop mixing so I reviewed and tried all the products (Sony, Sennheiser, Bose) out there that met my specs. Without a doubt, these headphones are the s--t! The earcups seal my ears so that I can concentrate on my mix. I get both awesome bass and highs. Crystal clear sound. And whenever I need to listen to my JBL EON 15 speakers bumping the sound of my mix, all I have to do is flip one of the earcups up. It's that simple! If you're a pro dj, you can't go wrong with these. If you're looking for a top quality headphone to listen to your mixes or music on your MP3 player, these are perfect for it!
5596	You want a good breakfast?: I really love the concept of this toaster. I can make eggs and toast at the same time, with little hassle at all! This product is so easy to use! I got this as a gift for one of my friend's mom because her toaster had recently broken. I know they like to have a hearty breakfast and eat eggs frequently. They prefer poached, while a prefer scrambled. But you can do both in this toaster! And hard boil them! And thaw meat! It is a cute and convenient size and works like a charm and is super quick! Thanks for the product!
5597	A Modernized Wrinkle in Time: The DVD of Madeleine L'Engle's book, A Wrinkle in Time, has been well-received by my students. We view it after we read the novel. While the DVD definitely adds modern touches, it does remain true to the novel. The bonus interview with Madeleine L'Engle provides a profound look inside the writer's mind. She encourages young people through her comments to begin writing now and to write what pleases them. I would definitely recommend this DVD for school libraries and classrooms.D.

5598	Nicely made and very sturdy: Made to sit on a seat or floor but I purchased it to sit inside my center console compartment. It adds a lot of organization to a catch all area. This unit is cleverly made in that the compartments are movable to suit your storage needs. The walls are stiff and secured with generous velcro tabs. Configured several ways from two long pockets to six small pockets. Nice to use and I'm glad I found it. Reasonably priced and shipped fast.
5599	Good job overall: The sprayer did a great job on the room I painted. I look forward to using it on a couple of other rooms, including a shed out in the yard. At first, I was worried because the hose wouldn't pressurize and actually I wasted a lot of time because it wouldn't work. I called Wagoner cust. service and they were very helpful. I was told to prime the pump for several minutes to get all of the air out. Once I did that, the sprayer worked awesome until I had finished the job!
5600	Throw in the garbage: This band stinks! Everything about it is ... how shall I put it.... not cool? From the pansy stupid weakling cover art to the pretentious attitude of "haha you idiot you paid money for our album" just makes me want to pile garbage on it and set it on fire to cleanse the universe. It's like pretentious elite indie clannish stupid rock wanting so bad to be like Converge. Just save yourself some time and just get a Converge album.
5601	Love it!: OK, I don't think this CD can actually be called Celtic music; Irish maybe, but not Celtic. It lacks some of the dreamy quality of good Celtic music but it's a ton of fun! The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it's impossible for me to drive to. The songs make me feel like dancing and that's a little bit hard in a car.
5602	Good Book so far.....: I haven't read the whole book, but so far it is good. It is also sad because the author Martha Beck, her son Adam has Down Syndrome, and it makes me sad just reading about it.
5603	iPoddish: My wife opened this from the package for me and the first thing she said is how "iPoddish" it seemed for a radio. Strapless, you must pocket this when walking. I wouldn't call this an exercise radio. It's more for travelling, mobility, etc. The internal AM/FM antenna is good for lacking telescopic function of bigger radios. The included earphone speakers far exceeded my expectations. Nothing cheap about them. Another plus: You only need one triple-A battery and this tiny radio, about the size of a lighter, is easy on power. Sleek, high-performing, including 5 presets each for AM/FM/TV, defaulted to shut off after 90 minutes to save batteries, and costing under $39 on Amazon, the DT-180 is a great choice for a "pocket receiver."
5604	Don't even bother: We live near a protected marshland park, and so our yard is loaded with mosquitoes. I spread this according to the directions throughout my half acre yard, spreading it with a fertilizer hand spreader. Even after waiting a few days, the number of bug bites I was getting after was pretty much the same as before. I saw no decrease for my time, money and effort, and I really wanted this to work.
5605	A Story Already Told: I had heard good things about this book, but was disappointed. This story had already been told in this format, and been told better, by Studs Terkel in his book The Good War. Terkel interviewed more persons, let them tell their own story, and interviewed persons who had been successful as well as those that had not. Brokaw focuses only on those that had gone on to become successful, while Terkel includes those from all walks of life. If you are interested in reading a history in this format, I would recommend The Good War over The Greatest Generation.
5606	A Wonderful product to have: I really enjoy the sound and quality of the product. But audacity recording software does not work properly on my computer. But other than that,product works wonderfully.Ion iTTUSB Turntable with USB Record
5607	Product has technical problem: This product has serious technical problem and does not hold pressure all times. It is very hard to get a replacement even within the warranty period. I will post more up to date information as I try to resolve the problem.Update: I am still having problem getting the company to honor their warranty. The warranty decisions are made overseas, and they pretty much ignore their U.S. customers.
5608	Lemony!: Dead on arrival. The display flickers, the clock acts erratically, many functions don't work right. Looks like I got a lemon. I could re-order, but this speaks to poor manufacturing to me. I'm gonna grab the smaller version which I used to have and which worked great.
5609	Jason Behr Proves His Acting Power: I first got this movie because the hottest guy that I have ever seen was acting in it, Jason Behr, thinking if I don't like the movie I can just tune out the noise and watch him. But as it turns out this movie was great. The other actors really do a fantastic job, the plot is wonderful as well. It isn't a high budget movie, and i don't even remember it out in theatres. But I am glad I watched it, and payed attention to it. I highly recomend this movie to Jason Behr fans, people that like thrillers, and who just want a good movie to watch.
5610	Manduka 71-Inch Yoga Mat: Great mat. Provides good purchase, even when getting sweaty. It is a bit short, if you are above 6ft. (like me) to do Ashtanga, but is great for Hatha Yoga.
5611	It' the little things...: These are excellent headphones, especially for the money. One little glitch...the cord is relatively short. I bought an extention cord, and I use the headphones all the time. Great sound.
5612	It's a matter of taste: One of my favorite composer is Bartók. I like old recordings and I bought this CD in expectation of something special. Unfortunately I don't like it. The first movement of the piano concerto maybe OK but the second and third are not for my taste. Mr. Sándor slows down when I would like faster tempos and speeds up when I expected slower tempos. The melodies are strange, he skips some beautiful moments. The Concerto less wrong but nothing special. Tempos are rather slow but in this case it is boring not beautiful. The last movement is fresh but nothing more. So I don't like this CD but I think it is a matter of taste.The transfer is acceptable considering its age but dynamics are extremely compressed. It is great that hiss almost completely filtered without too much influence to the sonority.
5613	Acutely disappointed by this cd: I'm very disappointed by what I heard on this cd. After read all those positive commentaries here, I expected that Russell Watson must be a fabulous singer. The truth is that his singing is much worse than the crooning of most people at the karaoke!Indeed, Watson's fails both as regards technical matters and interpretation. His singing is rough and inaccurate and the performances are charmless and stolid.Can't imagine a bigger disappointment from a vocal recording.
5614	"No one could beat us, we drink beer and wear Adidas!": Every song on this CD is brilliant, fun, and quirky. As testament to their greatness, the Bouncing Souls pull of even the silliest songs, such as their ode to their bike, with poignancy. This may be their greatest work, though Anchors Away ranks about par.They are my absolute favorite band, and they offer a DISTINCT SOUND in the punk genre.
5615	Nice overview of the Unitarian Universalist religion: Our UU group is reading this 2 chapters at a time & discussing weekly. This is a good pace because the material is better digested in bits. The Forrest Church chapters and the John Buehren chapters which alternate through the book are written in very different styles, but this works well. Not a 5 star because so many of the quotations from UUs are from 100-150 years ago - are there no current UUs worth quoting?This is a good book for those already in the UU church or for those seeking information before joining.
5616	Not her best: I thought Best Kept Secrets was all right. It was definately not a page turner like most other Sandra Brown books. I would recommend this one for a rainy afternoon when you have absolutely nothing else to do. Normally once I begin one of her novels, it's hard for me to put them down, but this one was not that way. I did manage to finish it, but it was definatly not the best I've ever read.
5617	not what picture shows: The picture shows white drum sticks--I received unfinished-brown sticks..I could've carved these myself froma tree limb.mis-advertised
5618	False Start / True End: I thing reviewers were wrong about the the "Four Sail" album which I really liked, so I decided to go a fewer albums deeper into the post-Forever Changes lineup. This time the critics were right, this album is incredibly bad. It reminds me of the movie Best Defense with Dudly Moore & Eddie Murphy, which Murphy did just to fulfill his contract. The songs are very flat as if he's composing on reserve fuel. It has a really generic funk/soul thing going on which sounds like Sly Stone on an off-off-off day, or the last line of filler that stands between the artist and the completely unusable material. Maybe I missed the "gems", but the whole album seems like filler. Also doesn't benefit from the "Eternal Drum Solo" (not the name of the song, but thats what I would call it).
5619	Delta RP14414 O-ring: This is a pretty specialized item, so if you are reading this review, you already know what this o-ring does and what it is for.Couldn't find the part locally, so I ordered it through Amazon.Price was great, and it is what it is.Works as advertised.
5620	Generally quite lovely . . .: . . . but I think bassist and cellist Danielsson would've been better served by placing himself in the context of a regular band, rather than a bass-plus-symponic-orchestra context. Indeed, the tracks with the guests work best (especially those featuring Nils Peter Molvaer on trumpet and Dave Liebman on soprano sax).The rest of the tracks seem to lack something, either becoming too conventionally pretty or too indulgently virtuosic. Yes, Danielsson is a very fine instrumentalist, but my own feeling is that the sonorities of the bass/cello are somewhat irritating when placed so far up front in the sound image, as they are on many of the numbers, especially without the balance of horns, winds, piano, and guitar.Not what I expected, and somewhat disappointing, but may be welcomed by those who are especially taken by the bass as a lead instrument.
5621	Yes it's as good as you'd hoped!!: Great game, beautiful graphics, frenetic gameplay. You can literally jump on the backs of your stunned, prone enemies and surf around the area, shooting all the while. I'm serious. Yes, it is very hard, when you are given a chance to start over in Easy mode, take that opportunity. Trickster is the most accesible style. The easiest way to bulid up red orbs and stuff is to replay the first few levels a number of times to accumulate goodies. Just go to the level select option and voila! I bought two blue orbs to double extend my life bar before I even atempted the 4th level. The cutscenes are awesome and laugh out loud funny. Dante has been turned into a waaaay overboard hipster, but he still is appealing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO SUPER HARDCORE GAMERS ONLY. 5/5
5622	Just not much there: The message in this book is genuine and could be helpful if you've never ever read any business advice or self-development books. But it's just a rehash of lots of other stuff in painfully simple terms. Every few pages has a huge quote taking up a full page, so the book only really comes out to about 80 pages of actual text, and this is on very small pages with the text evenly spread out.It's a nice try but there are so many other books worth your money: Good to Great, The 4-Hour Work Week, 7 Spiritual Laws of Success, Never Eat Alone, the War of Art...read all those first.
5623	Fun book to read, but lack of strong ending: This book was pretty good. I couldn't put it down after I read first few chapters. Molly's courage and struggle through her tough life simply melt my heart. It was quite inspiring. However, I didn't rate this book 5 stars because I thought the ending was pretty dull. Also I didn't like the idea of Molly's sleeping with her lover's daughter. That's sick! This is a brilliant book if only the ending wasn't so dull. It could have been so much better. Overall, it's a fun book to read.
5624	Will not recommend: I was totally disappointed with this item. It is way too small for a teenager, the band does not look durable.
5625	Do Not Buy This Book: This book mixes the brevity of Schaum's Outlines with the incomprehensibility of The Tao of Pooh. The author copies, sometimes, directly from either Schaum's or Arfkin. There is nothing noteworthy in this book and your money is better spent buying the original books, i.e. Schaum's. I am supprised that Cambridge University Press would publish this and not fear the litigation from more respectable authors who Chow copied this from. If you wrote a Schaum's or any Math Methods book please check for plagairism, it is there. If you are a Prof. thinking of assigning this book, Don't. And if you are a student who is required to buy this book, use the original Schaum's Outlines!
5626	Awesome!: I'm giving this CD to my 16 year old daughter who is anorexic and suffers from associated ill-temper. I am praying she will listen to Joey and find herself in the midst of this terrible time. Thank you, Joey, for the inspiration.
5627	returned it - the plastic tabs holding the item together are very flimsy- correct this and it would be a great product: has a design flaw but great idea- the tabs are so flimsy i returned it just after trying to put it together. even that almost made them break- i can't imagine having to use them for months on end and BELIEVE ME- the design of this box makes it so that the tabs are extremely important. if they break, the whole thing is unusable
5628	samsung battery and charger: I purchased the battery for my camcorder for Christmas day so I could record my son opening presents. The battery maybe lasted an half hour before dying out. I would not recommend the battery.
5629	Pride and Prejudice and Pathetic: This was one of the worst books I have ever taken to the beach. What a letdown. Instead of a Jane Austen-esque novel filled with good fun and lighthearted humor, this book is full of unlikeable, one-dimensional characters. The very idea that Elizabeth and Darcy would allow their children to roam about London is preposterous in itself. But instead of making this a fun romp, the author took the exact same plot and characters and made them boring and stupid.The best part of this book? The cover art. Or possibly when it ended. Honestly, the author copied Pride and Prejudice, except Pride and Prejudice and Zombies was an infinitely better take on the familiar plot. If you must read it, get it from a library for God's sake.
5630	Universal it is not: I purchased this product because of its supposed univeral specs. I have a 3" cylinder that it does not fit, and I have a 2" cylinder that it does fit but because of the flange on the cylinder the donut is very difficult to hold in place until it is seated by pressure. I have a 13/4" cylinder that it fits but then there is no room for except a very small penis which thankfully I don't have.So, it was pretty much a waste of money.
5631	Kamenstein 12 Tin Magnetic Spice Rack: I love my spice rack. I was hoping to hang it on the wall, but it was just a liitle too tall for the space between the counter and cabinets, but it really takes up very little counter space. I do with the opening was easier to find, it seems that I spin the lid around several times trying to find it. Maybe an indention or mark where the opening is. Other than that, I am very happy with my purchase. I fill the tins with my own seasonings, but it does come with seasonings. I didn't use the lables since I use differnt spices, but a small strip of masking tape and a sharpie work just fine for me. I think this is a great value for as many containers as you get.
5632	I don't know: I don't have any indication this works, and it does make me a little nauseous when I take it.Hard to evaluate vitamins and supplements but I know I took it as directed and didn't lose any weight so that's the limit of my ability to judge.
5633	On not becoming what you hate: This promising text, is in the end, an unfortunate example of just what it tries to resist: a demonization of the "enemy" as "un-Christian." Sadly, this tract will become gospel for those who haven't taken the time to get to know fundamentalists as individuals, rather than as a composite monster. As an author of two books on scripture and an avid-anti-fundamentalist, I fear that this book will simply draw sharper lines between "us" and "them," when it could have become an exercise in compassion.
5634	I shall wear purple as My Badge of Experience: I first found this provacative, yet accessible collection at a local book store when I was 19. Now, I am 26, and I still cherish the prose and pictures of women's life cycles and women's power. I only hope to live to grow so gracefully bold.
5635	False advertisement photo!: The device was easy to install and the instructions were fairly clear. We purchased this item primarily for its large display numbers. However, the visibility of the numbers is extremely poor and no where near that shown in the item photo. The screen is "backlit" by a light on one side which energizes during a call or upon button pressing. The light increases number legibility somewhat but it is still rather poor. I will return this item and look for a product with better number visibility.
5636	very helpful: I'm not a gadget person, but this is one computer accessory that I like.It's a little awkward that the machine does not sit down into this stand or that the stand doesn't exactly cradle the computer. But it serves the purpose of keeping me from getting hot lap while I use the computer and it keeps the computer from overheating.I think it probably does also make for a more comfortable angle to use the computer but that was not my reason for purchasing it.Overall it does what I needed, and it's quiet.
5637	Didn't work for me: I bought this to try and stop my dog from barking every time someone walks past our house. I can tell she hears the noise but it's done nothing to stop the barking, unfortunately. It was inexpensive, so worth a try, but it didn't work for me.
5638	Amazon Rocks!: The Verilux lamp is terrific. It is clear, bright, and has two convenient brightness settings. Unfortunatly the one I received died after less than a month. Amazon replaced it immediately, without a problem!!! Amazon rocks! Thank you Amazon.
5639	Works great, innovative design!: I ordered this product to go on my newly built and stained deck. It is wonderful having a precicely matching bench for my lovely deck, and the innovative design allows me to use it either as seating or an eating spot.
5640	It's The Real Thing: This stuff took out months-old cat vomit from white carpet that other cleaners could not remove. Bought Spot Shot because of the good reviews on Amazon. And very satisfied. Also very happy it's "safe for pets".
5641	Sophmoric novel from an immature X generation apologist: The Tenth Justice had a neat concept but was flawed with inane dialogue and 20 something characters that were all momma's boys. I bought Dead Even thinking that a second novel would be a more mature effort. But in the first few pages we have Sara Tate, Columbia Law School graduate calling her legal assistant "amigo" on the first day. While the concept of husband and wife being on opposite sides of a case is potentially interesting, some of the stuff they do even lawyers wouldn't do in real life. Meltzer is 0 for 2 as far as I'm concerned and novelists unlike baseball strike out with me after two strikes.
5642	Solid to start, but don't expect it to last...: I have two of these. Neither of them work very well anymore. The twist function, which was important for the games I wanted to use them with was inaccurate at best. It wasn't bad when I first purchased the joysticks, but about 6 months to a year later they had degraded to the point that the games were no longer enjoyable...more like frustrating because of the joystick.You may get lucky and get one that lasts, but even though I said 6 months to a year it was very infrequent use...perhaps once or twice a week at the most.
5643	High-Quality Recording... Oh Yeah?: I am pleased with the ease of the interface, but I was a little disappointed with the recording quality. It wasn't much better then the computer's internal microphone.
5644	This book is a nightmare: There's no proper index for the recipes, so it's very hard to find what you're looking for without reading, and memorizing THE WHOLE BOOK.The fonts are very small, and very hard to follow (and I have a perfect vision).I didn't even bother to read ONE recipe through.All in all, will never use this book to look up a QUICK recipe. Will use it to stop doors, kill pests, press wrinkled papers, and dry flowers.
5645	Analog Scanner: While the Uniden Bearcat BCT8 Warning System may be a great scanner and received mostly great reviews, it was not made clear that this is an analog scanner and will not pick up transmissions made in digital mode.Unfortunately, it was after my 30-day return period had passed that I learned the reason I was having trouble picking up local transmissions was that my local public service agencies broadcast digitally. So a word of caution to prospective buyers, make sure how your local agencies are broadcasting and choose your scanner appropriately.
5646	THE BEST: This is the best straightener I have ever used. Whenever I don't have much time in the morning, I just wash and dry my hair really quick, and use the straightener. It only takes about 5 or 10 minutes to use on my long hair. It does get really hot, so be careful with it.
5647	DELIGHTFUL!: Definately entertaining; a light hearted recitation of the trials and tribulations of "going native" in beautiful Tuscany. How the author struggled to change his life style from the intensity and stressful rythm of Los Angeles artistic industry to the relaxed approach to living in an Italian village (though not without incident).
5648	Tracklisting: 1. For Tomorrow (Original Single Mix)2. Science Fiction (Remember Of '89 Mix)3. Crescent (Moonlit Mix)4. For Tomorrow (Silent Poets Remix)Toy's Factory Japan 1994
5649	Bright treble: Model AT 440ML. Bottom line up front: The upper mids and highs are harsh and excessive, it's missing punchy mids, the bass is light and firm but not muddy or boomy. The upside is that stereo channel separation is awesome. Unless you like excessive treble then don't waste your time on this one.
5650	Disappointing: Honestly, I thought it was horrible! we don't want to see how glee changed someones life, we want to see them preform!
5651	This cd is for everyone! it is the best!: this cd is awesome! jed-heads and non-jed-heads alike should love it! jed-heads love it especially, i know first hand. i'm proud to be a jed-head! jed-heads all over the world, unite!
5652	Olympus 330: This dye sublimation printer gives beautiful prints that give you all the sharpness and resolution that is as good or better than a film camera. I have only used it in printing the memory card with the printer (not hooked up to the computer). The one bothersome thing I have noticed is that it only gives 30 prints per ribbon not 60.
5653	Great adventure story!: I friend of mine recommended this book and told me it was his favorite book of all time. He also said to make sure you get the unabridged version. (It is over 1400 pages long, but after the first 300-400 pages you will be glad it is so long.) Not only does this book have incredible insight into the human condition, it is also a very exciting tale of escape and revenge as well as a great "trip" to Europe. You will be amoung "bandits" in the ruins of Rome, high society Europe during Carnival, Parisian society as well as sea faring trips with smugglers through coastal Spain and Italy.
5654	HORRIBLE...: I ordered a new condition book for my husband. I received this book with the cover ripped and used. The pages were falling from the out the binding. Very disappointed. I contacted the seller and had no response for weeks now. I am never ordering from them again.
5655	The days of your youth, and the endless possibilities: Listening to this CD, you will be reminded of good times and the people you once knew. You can think of loves lost and friendships found while listening to this collection. From the buoyant energy of INXS' "New Sensation" to the yearning of Foreigner's "I Don't Want To Live Without You" and Boy Meets Girl's "Waiting For A Star To Fall" to the nostalgia of Eric Carmen's "Make Me Lose Control", your memories will be sparked. Your emotions will run high. This CD gives you hope that the endless summer nights of joy and love will come back.
5656	Great unit: Was a lenghty decision between the iMac and Sony desktop! Though, I'm incredibly happy I decided on the Sony. Amazon was the best price and free shipping. It arrived only a few days after I ordered. Very, very and very satisfied with the product and Amazon.
5657	Cream at the BEEB: I read the reviews regarding sound quality, as well as reviews of other BBC Sessions albums I have and decided that the complaints come from trying to compare these live recordings to the remastered studio albums. After listening to it all the way through twice I think the sound quality is what you'd expect for a BBC Sessions album, not perfect, but far from unlistenable. The album includes an excellent version of Robert Johnson's Four Until Late. Other standouts include Born Under a Bad Sign and Cat's Squirrel. The worst sounding songs quality-wise are Sunshine Of Your Love and Rollin' and Tumblin', but I can live with those. Chalk up another one for the BBC by presenting some more material from the Sixties, sounds as fresh as it did all those years ago.
5658	This is the thing you need to exterminate ants: In the past I have a headache for the ants until I found this one. I tried other products, but none of them work.It is gel. Ants really like it.Just apply couple drops in the line of ants army. No necessary to be close to their nest.Couple days later you will find they are gone.Highly recommend it.
5659	The Glass Key: Read this book, then watch Miller's Crossing. I was appalled to see how badly the Coen brothers ripped off Hammett. An excellent read.
5660	Nothing changes!: Well, it's great in the fact that it puts the gameboy advance game images on the big screen, but there is really no other point to it. I think the idea is a good one, however, normally if I playing my Gamecube, I'd play Gamecube games and vice versa. There is no difference in game play for any game, and you've lost the capability to move around. The graphics overall don't change, only the size. It's more of a hassle to hook up the Gamecube then to just put it in your SP or DS. This is DEFINATELY NOT A NECESSITY for a Gamecube.
5661	Skip away from David Arquette: Run away from any picture featuring David Arquette. Man, the guy is an atrociously bad actor. Every quality this movie could have (be it, fun!)is destroyed by his "acting".
5662	One Star Reviews of Twilight Are More Interesting to Read Than the Book Itself: As I said....I had more hysterical fun reading the one star reviews of this book than I did reading the actual book. It is so laughably, horribly, awfully bad. Its incomprehensible how it was published. It isn't even fun trash novel reading. The characters are poorly drawn, the plot is non-existent, and the writing...oh God the writing...Edward is constantly "smirking" and letting out "low chuckles" (the low chuckles...oh I'm laughing hysterically again...there must have been at least six of those in the first few chapters alone). Like most poor writers who can't set up and tell a story with any narrative skill, she relies on endless (and repetitive) adverbs and dialogue tags to describe the story.Amazon one star reviewers....thanks for the laughs.
5663	Smoothing the edges: 2 1/2This is a more mature effort from the buzzed-out alternative rock band who hit it part-time big in the 90's. Besides for some production refinement, unfortunately that maturity does not translate much in the ways of songwriting, leaving much of what was great in their brief stride distilled into chewable bits of consciously presented comeback tracks.
5664	I'm not too sure about "Ultimate": My 8 year old son and I bought this book after seeing the wonderful projects on T.V. I thought it would be a great way to keep him busy and allow us to make things together. Although the book claims that the items used in the projects are found right in your home, I always found myself having to go out and buy the ingredients. Out of the ten or so projects we have done so far, only 2 have turned out right. I must say, even after following the directions to a precise T, the results have been a big disappointment.
5665	Brilliant step forward: Once again Icon of Coil does not dissappoint. This new album builds on all of their previous work and takes their sound to a new level of maturity. Icon of Coil, known for their introspective (albeit sometimes seemingly juvenile) lyrics accompanied by a driving beat, has evolved to a plateau of cemented self identity. While they are standing shoulder to shoulder to such bands as VNV Nation, Covenant and Apop and even utilizing some of their colleagues sounds in homage, they have stood by their guns and etched out a unique sound within their genre of music.Upon first listen, songs like "dead enough to live" jump out as certain dance floor hits. Multiple listenings will reveal such gems as: "shelter" and "consumer".
5666	Terrible: I bought this after their Seven Days album (which I loved) and this is a real disappointment. More like a collection of silly beats and silly noises than music. Can't say there was a single track I'd ever want to listen to again.
5667	Good and stable memories: I have also a twin memory modules of this memory but PC6400 and they work just sweet. Fair enough for gaming. Looks good on its heat sink but what is important is the performance. This memory rules.
5668	Book-Fever: My daughter needed this for a school project. I received it in about 3 days. Took a load off my back!!
5669	The Buckinghams - Up Close - the Definitive Live DVD & CD: If you enjoy the Buckingham's music I highly recommend this product. The DVD quality is very good, songs selection are great.
5670	Understanding _before_ power - at least a start: / I have some patience with a writer who wishes us to understand and empathise _before_ we start trying to wield power.Drunvalo has an excellent-sounding name for this business (!), but readers who dare to start with changing themselves first could do worse than follow his suggestions.Geometry and mathematics _are_ sacred of course, and Mr Melchizedek could do some good here. Aimed, I could hope, at a different kind of reader from the foolhardy Egyptian sorcerers' apprentices and kabbalistic mystics of "silence", who make the hairs stand up on the backs of our necks, at least speaking for myself.
5671	Who is this again, its not Jewel????: Wow. What a disappointment. Her beautiful voice is covered up by poppy bubble gum beats, sounds more like Britney Spears. Big big difference from her last album "This Way" which is my personal favorite. Your above the whole Pop Princess thing Jewel, take back your crown and leave this bee bop bubble gum stuff behind!
5672	Alarm????: I set the clock every night and and it has yet to go off. Sometimes when I look at the time it is off by hours. I believe this product is going back for a refund.
5673	Unbelievable product!: I almost choked at the price for a heating pad..but it has been worth EVERY penny. It is so lightweight, foldable, and safe to boot. I'll probably buy another one since my kids always fight over who gets to use it!
5674	best present: We bought this for my 10 year old son's best friend (who is 11). They played with it for hours. My only mistake was not buying one for my son and his little bother. I plan to buy another and the smaller version for my 6 year old. I read the safety concerns by other reviewers. We will keep check on the bottom tip and order a few to have on hand, so we can replace as needed.
5675	M-O-B-B: This album is terrible. Mobb deep should never have signed with g-unit. Their beats, their flows are going downhill and it's sad to see because i am a fan of the mobb. 50 you are ruining rap.
5676	Ink cartridges: I was unable to find these outdated cartridges locally because my printer is old. Amazon had what I needed.
5677	These earphones aren't that great: They were great in the beginning, and the sound quality was amazing. Every sound around me was blurred out and all i heard was the music. The only problem was that they broke within the month that i bought them. :( Make sure u have a good warranty when u buy them.
5678	LOVE IT!: i love Diane chamberlain so much. i happen to run across this book while browsing for a new book by her, and i must say its absolutely wonderful. i sat up at night waiting to finish it but sad when i did. i have yet to come across a bad book by her, and i am sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what she will come up with next!!
5679	Boring script, boring music: This movie was an absolute bore. there was no chemistry between the characters...the music was long and dull. My husband slept through it and I fast forwarded through the "music." The characters weren't endearing. The best part was the scenery.
5680	Never order a ham and cheese sandwich in a kosher deli again: OK, I'm one of the authors, so I won't review my own book. I'll just say that Vikki and I had a fun time writing it, did lots of research and listened to great stories from our friends and families. Leeza Gibbons mentioned the book on "Extra!" and Eve Ensler wrote us a very nice note about how her cast reads it backstage at the "Vagina Monologues."Here are what other people are saying:-- "It's a sassy but thoroughly accurate guide to the basics of Judaism..." -- Toronto Star-- "The authors have a wonderful sense of humor -- jokes sprinkled like kosher salt through the pages." -- New Orleans Times-Picayune
5681	No more plastic liners: I can not say enough about this litterbox. I really like the fact that you don't use pan liners with this. No more stinky bags and wasted litter.The only problem is one of the slide locks broke and I have to hold it tight when I roll the box. I saved one of the litter containers and lined it with a trash bag then dump the waste in it and take it to the dump. This litterbox is well worth the money.
5682	Kindle2: I purchased a Kindle2 one month ago. On a recent trip, it fell out of my hands to the ground. It was in it's Kindle cover. Now 3/4 of an inch of the top portion is blank. I can no longer read it without constantly switching fonts. I called customer service and was told, "I am sorry this is not covered by your warranty. If you pay another $200 we can replace it for you!" Since there was no warning indicating that dropping a Kindle would render it unusable, I cannot recommend it to anyone who ever drops anything. Although I truly enjoyed this product for the month I had it, I cannot recommend that someone pay $385 for it.
5683	Pee on the floor: I bought this potty for my daughter and everytime she goes on it a small amount of pee is in the potty the rest is on the floor. The collection bowl doesn't fit properly. There is a big gap in the front of the potty. Plus getting the bowl off the bottom is such a struggle that I usually end up spilling the contents anyway. I am going to buy a new potty today.
5684	As to not make your ego larger Mr. Ablan...: Having read this book (As thick as it was) in under a week, I thought that it was a very well written technical manual which was very informative in the subject matter at hand. It was direct, clear, and presented in such a way that even if the reader has no concept of 3D designing whatsoever, they would be able to create at least a spinning logo by the time they are done. Definately the best lightwave manual to date! (Newtek, take notes.) Cant wait till Inside Lightwave 8!
5685	Batter Tender Jr.: Worked as advertised. Easy to set up and the system "tends" the battery. Would stronly reccommend to anyone with a motorcycle, 4 wheeler or riding mower for that matter.
5686	Perfect.: I feel like I basically stole this product. It is absolutely perfect for my 42" LCD TV. It took about 10 minutes to get everything mounted and my TV set up. It looks secure, and I cannot believe how cheap this product was.
5687	World's best headphones: I think these are the world's best headphones, in this weight-class and price-class. I feel these are terribly under-priced by Sony. I've been using this for the last 5 years, with very frequent rough handling, and they refuse to die. Sound quality is excellent. You could wear this the entire day and you won't feel a thing. For this price, just buy it, even if you don't plan to use it. Who knows, Sony might discontinue this product and you might see a need for such great/light headphones in the future.
5688	Great for Tiny Work: I build models for my model railroad layout, and find this a very nice tool. It has advantages compared to other miter boxes, such as many extra angles besides 90 and 45. I use the 22.5 a lot. It has a lip on the front edge that helps hold it steady against the front of the workbench, I really like that. I've read that others don't like it because it's plastic, but if you're using a thin saw such as a Zona it might take out a bit of plastic on it's first few passes, but it works itself in eventually and does a great job. Plus the plastic does not wear on the teeth of your saws like an aluminum unit would. So the price, extra angles and lip on the front make this a very good mini miter box. 5 Stars!
5689	Directors cut????: I purchased this video, after reading about its features, thinking it was the "original cut, not the directors cut. I am displeased with the video only because I was sent the directors cut vs the original score, which I may add that the directors cut has a totally different musical score thoughout the entire movie (which I do not like), many extra scenes and cut scenes from the original movie release. There was "no" mention on the web page that this was a directors cut, thus I feel ripped off. This is a great film for me in its original format, but very poor in the directors cut. The company that sold it probably just wanted to get rid of these extra directors cut videos, and did not tell the truth about the movie format just to get them out of the store. VERY DISPLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE
5690	Excellent, if you are a beginner in Oracle: Oralce databse is a great topic. If you are the expert in it, I am sure you can find a job in everywhere.Under re-enginnering process, most of companies will use database and IT technology to save their labour cost. Oracle becomes the key on the process. However a lot of books in the market are too difficult for beginners. Some of them only explain the idea without examples and practices.Through this book, you can learn the basic concepts and take some hands-on exercises. Although it is not the best starting reference (more exercises will be much better), I still recommend this book for the one who interest in Oracle.
5691	A Quality Project: I really enjoyed this album. I'm a big Donnie McClurkin fan so I may be biased. "Cry for Help" is my favorite song on the CD. I also enjoyed "Said He Would," the lyrics really express the awesomefaithfulness of God. I highly recommend this album, you'll be blessed.
5692	Art of Zandra Rhodes review: Expensive, worth every last cent. Wonderful work and exceptional photographics. Wont be parting with this book.
5693	Dirty Dancing Sound Track: 'Bought the cd for my son and daughter in law. They love it. They set it up to listen to while they run their marathons.
5694	Certainly not the best of the breed.: This text pales in comparison to another I have read devoted to UI design. Everything here seemed like a repeat of what I have read before. Worse yet, it was delivered with less interesting, and less easily digested, prose. I found the content generally shallow and the examples lacking.I suggest that you consider "About Face" by Alan Cooper instead. There is a book that rates a 10.
5695	taking the Hazards and Mains through Reconstruction: The Hazards and Mains attempt to survive in the Reconstruction era in this the final book of the North and South Trilogy. Charles Main--the focus of the book--must deal with his status as traitor, as well as the death of his lover and raising his infant son, while he tries to find a place in the American West. Madeleine, Orry's widow, tries to fight racism and provide for the freedmen of her plantation. Meanwhile, Bent and Ashton are still looking for revenge, which is the running theme of the novel. Revenge against the North, against other races, against each other; the horrible feelings of a defeated and broken world. John Jakes concludes his fascinating historical/sociological trilogy with great changes and complications and eventual conclusion for his characters that span almost every aspect of America at the time. Grade: A-
5696	Alright, mostly: Used this to support DVDs and zip drive. Work OK except booting with this card takes a very long time.
5697	Ants love Terro as much as you do: This thing rocks. I had ants problem recently in my kitchen area inside cabinet under the stove and the trail leads to an inaccesable area. My kitchen is always clean and I kill them whenever I see them around but without help, ants seem getting more and spread out. I read somewhere that when you kill the ant workers, the queen will produce more. After reading the reviews on Amazon, I purchased this stuff and follow instruction to setup the bait. After just 30 minutes, ants found their way to the bait and had a party with hundreds of them around the bait. The best thing is not all of them die immediately but they were able to bring the juice back to share with their queen. After 24 hours, I saw much less ant on the trail and this morning (after 36 hours) the trail is gone, no ant at all, I will leave Terro there for a week just in case, but so far, ZERO ant count. I love Terro as much as ants do!
5698	Very Strange Book: I have a hate-love relationship with this book. I am plowing through it but don't really like it. I can't stop reading it, but the characters don't speak to me at all. The writing is pretty sloppy, the story skips around in a hard-to-follow manner, the language is pretty raw (and I am no prude). I'm 2/3 through and haven't run into the cancer thing yet, but I doubt it will improve my poor impression of this book. Sorry.
5699	One of a Kind: My brother is 6 years older than I am. He used to play this record a lot. When he was gone, I would sneak in and play it too. I have the LP in my possession now and have been looking for the CD forever. My two favorites are "Work It Out" and "You Know I Love You." This is a gem. It brought tears to my eyes tonite to find it.Thanks Amazon!!!
5700	ICED EARTH MEET GREEK POWER!: Im proud to say that i was a little part of this 3cd album creation..since i was one of the thousands i was screaming and singing and headbagging when ICED EARTH visit us in Athens...i traveled 5 hours to see them live and i say it was the best night of my life...And while i considered myself as the luckiest man on earth they release ALIVE IN ATHENS...i immidietly bought it so that i will never forget this night!Everyone go and buy it and share with all the greek fans a night of true Metal....thank you NEW MONSTERS OF ROCK!
5701	So long Levi's...: I've been wearing Levi's for three decades and decided to try a pair of Carhartt's and give them a try after reading several reviews. I will never buy another pair of Levi's again...these Carhartt's are the best...great quality, great fit and great price....
5702	bucket organizer: This product works just as it should and it really helps to get things in order.Each piece appears to be constructed well and it fits perfectly into a 5 gallon bucket.
5703	Peru (The Traveller's Wildlife Guide): Used this on our trip to Peru and it was the envy of our very knowledgeable tour guide. We ended up buying him a copy as a gift.
5704	Disappointing: Extremely disappointed with this mat - expected it to be heavy duty but the paint chipped within 1 week. Of course it's too heavy to mail back.
5705	Another awesome Laurie Notaro adventure!: Laurie Notaro is quite possibly one of the funniest authors I've ever read. I'm sad that her books only come out once in a while. I actually find myself laughing out loud as I'm reading about her crazy tales. In "An Idiot Girl's Christmas," she totally captures some of the horrorific things that people endure during the holidays, but the spin she puts on them is hilarious! It's a great read- for yourself or a holiday gift for others.
5706	A Shakespearean Wannabe: Yes, the plot is entertaining but the writing is ennervating. This outright attempt to immitate Shakespeare is ANNOYING! It is a ripoff in plot and language, and if I really wanted to read Shakespeare, I would have picked one of his plays or sonnets to read and not this book I wish I had been forewarned. If you enjoy medieval books, skip this one.
5707	Love them: Great jandals - comfortable to wear and last for ages. Absolutely love them and 100% happy with them. Good colour as it goes with lots of things.
5708	Incredibly real and inspiring! Triumphant!: I absolutely loved this book! Some of the reasons that I liked it: The main character is so real; every reader can find part of him or herself in Dolores. It kept me interested from the moment I started reading it; I couldn't put it down. It shows how hateful people can be, but also how wonderful they can be. It will change your opinions about certain types of people.
5709	Old shocker is a classic: Contemporary? -no. Genius? -almost. It isn't Burroughs' style that makes the book but his ability to tell a good story. Sit back and read this one while in rehab.
5710	Sharpe's Excellence: As usual the Sharpe's Series is topnotch. I bought the first three at Sam's Club. Unfortunately they stopped carrying it before I could get to number four, but that's okay, I will carry on with Amazon. Good action, authenticity, good acting. Not only history buffs, re-enactors, and costume epic fans will enjoy this, but also romantics and lover's of action will love it.
5711	Thank God She Survived: With so many of these type of stories ending tragically (Taylor Behl, the young lady in Aruba, etc.) it is such a relief to find one that ultimately turned out o.k.Ms. Smith has written a manual on self-survival that should be read by everyone. Her God-given ability to remain calm in the most stressful of situations no doubt saved her life. Panic would have only accelerated an already dangerous predicament.Though it might not work in every case, Ashley was just what Brian Nichols needed to show him what he was. Not only that, the same was true in reverse. Thankfully, they were both willing to respond. I am a firm believer that God knows who He can trust in certain situations to achieve His purpose. If I could speak to Ashley, I would say, "Thanks for being a willing servant -- and for surviving."
5712	Awesome Gospel Cd!: This cd inspires me so much!I am so happy I took a chance and bought it.I bought some as gifts for people.This is one spirit filled recording.I highly recommend it,if you want to be lifted up!
5713	The Best Gunfighter Ballads Ever: I had always been a fan of Marty Robbins, but when he released El Paso....I was completely sold on his singing. This CD with two of his western albums on one, makes for wonderful listening. I have added it to my Ipod playlist of cowboy and western songs.....perfect for the "cowboy" or "cowgirl" in each of us!
5714	Dinos make learning a new language fun: I think that it is a lot easier for children to learn a new language at a younger age because it doesn't come across as a chore to them, but rather a new and fun way to communicate. I looked into the Spanish set before I made the purchase and I am glad I did. The children are able to speak full sentences, although they really enjoy looking at pictures of objects and reciting the Spanish word for that object. I would recommend theis set to others.
5715	Learn QiGong: Qi (or Chi) Gong is a great way to exercise to control breathing and to relax and this video has helped me learn it to get those benefits with lessons that make it easy to understand.I definately feel more relaxed and giving myself some time to do these exercises is now something I am getting into the habit of doing now for the last couple of months. I am also gaining some flexibility and strength. Hugging The Tree (one of the extra routines in addition to the 8 Pieces) has helped make my upper body stronger.
5716	Steve Walsh...mmmm....goood....: How could you ever get tired of Steve Walsh's voice? He is certainly one of the greatest vocalists of all time. Billy Greer on bass is not only a great bassist, but another excellent vocalist. Overall, this CD really rocks! If you are a Kansas fan (and who isn't?) add this to your collection. Not as classically steeped, but rocks out in an equally pleasing way.
5717	The First Four Are Great, but Side 2 isnt that Timeless!: I liked this album till the end. In the end I started to cry after hearing songs like NEVER SAY GOODBYE. The First 4 are all great HEADBANGERS!! Somehow I kinda start to think that all these slow power ballads make me sad..the only ballad I have ever loved in my whole life was ''Waiting For A Girl Like You'' by Foreigner which I found that song sweet and lovely, and wonderful and I think it is the greatest song in the world. But anyway, I would recommend this and this is better than albums by crappy bands like Pearl Jam, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, and AC/DC.
5718	Get more life out of a bar of soap: This simple design works for keeping a bar of soap from getting mushy and works nicely as a dish sponge holder. For soaps, it works great on the vanity counter where the soap does not get as wet. In the shower, the shelf where my soap holder sits on gets pretty wet. When the wet soap dries, soap does get stuck on the prongs. But it does extend the life. These holders do have a strong plastic-y smell which has not gone away after a month of use.
5719	Amazing!: I loved this movie, so I had to buy the soundtrack. I admit that the main reason I wanted the soundtrack was to listen to Long Time Coming by Oliver James. He is one amazing guy.I think this movie is one of the only movies that has a whole sountrack of good songs. Other movies have some good songs, but every song on this soundtrack is amazng.2 thumbs up!
5720	Clive and Naomi fizzle: I wanted to like this movie. It stars two of my favorites Naomi Watts and Clive Owen. It has an interesting concept and it just... misses. The acting is good but it seems to get sidetracked and just doesn't hold you nor does it pay off in the end. It is just missing something and I think that the story just goes awry. Also it has some ridiculous action sequence that is totally unbelievable and not needed at all.
5721	I did like it UNTIL....: It ripped within 4 months of my receiving this as a gift. My friend couldn't find the receipt so I didn't think I could return it. AND, it ripped where it wasn't even a lot of stuff in there. It ripped at the bottom left-hand side where it was ONLY holding my license.
5722	Bosch Micro Edge Wiper Blades: Will never buy Bosch wiper blades again. Paid almost 50 bucks for a pair of Bosch Micro Edge wiper blades about 8 months ago, now find out they do not offer refill inserts for the blades any longer. Now you have to buy new wiper blade assemblies instead of just replacing the inserts. Rip Off.
5723	New Age Rock Masterpiece: Mystical, noble, evocative... An amazing debut! Lush, layered soundscapes with legitimate composition, more so than the usual new age meandering, with seductive, haunting vocals. A must buy...
5724	Leave old ladies alone!: If you are an actor/actress and are offered a role in such a movie, then it's a sign that your career is going down!In short, an old lady cast a spell on a bank employee who refuses to extend her another chance to keep her house. Yeah, there is surprising scenes of the old lady throwing up on different occasions and sucking on her chin after losing her dentures, so in short it's kind of disgusting not suspenseful.I suggest that you don't bug us old ladies, and most importantly don't use us in stupid movies!
5725	1 mic: Nas should've retired after Illmatic. Sure, this is better than Stillmatic, but that's like bragging about winning the special olympics.
5726	Chapin's passion shines through her music!: This is one of those rare CDs that I can put in and listen to beginning to end. It is a bit more traditional country than is played on the radio today, which is not a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination.It kicks off with "The Hard Way" and goes right into the women's anthem "He Thinks He'll Keep Her", about the guy who takes his woman for granted (as many guys do). "I Feel Lucky" was a big hit on the radio. "The Bug" is an upbeat, fun romp, as is "Passionate Kisses". "I Take My Chances" and "Come On Come On" end the disc on a great note. Chapin is a talented writer and performer and I know she will be around for awhile!
5727	Where's the Brazilian music?: As a big fan of this series, my expectations may have been too high. This is the worst of the series. It lacks the Brazilian influence. This release is "stretching the soup", so to speak.
5728	Terribly dull...: Chi Chi LeRue, Karen Dior or Mickey Skee should have written this, or even Crystal Crawford. There's no emotion or heart in this book. Go read any of the articles about Joey, not this.
5729	Stylish, but unsatisfying: The headset has all the style it promised. The sound was good without being great. I found it difficult to use:1. Despite for different ear holders, it never became stable2. The ear piece kept falling out (and getting lost) which make it uncomfortable and less stable in the ear3. It appears that it's draining battery unless you explicitly turns it off. I kept finding that it wasn't ready.I've returned to my default choice of Plantronics.
5730	Small binoculars: These binoculars are superb. Good quality and the are comfortable to handle. Nice carry case that can go on your belt.
5731	Just saw this again...: ...and have the same opinion I did when it came out. Other than a few mildly amusing scenes, not really a very good movie. Very cliche, not really funny, very silly in a bad way, and "witness" or not, anyone normal woul've brought Hooch to an animal shelter immediately after the first destructive incident.
5732	Awful book: I enjoyed the first few chapters enough to ignore the badly written bits. But by halfway, it got so much worse-the sex degenerated into masochism, the characters talk soooooo much and so boringly, the extreme and unending physical and emotional trauma, could not make up for the few nice touches, the small amount of good writing.What is so astounding is that people have so fallen for this ridiculous bodice-ripper.
5733	Very Lush and Flowing: This is a very lush and flowing album. It sets a guitar based tone early on, and then just goes. A mixture of acoustic guitars, subtle electric guitars and pleasant sounding synthesizers transform slowly over two long pieces, aptly titled Elastic, and Beautiful Acre. A slight desert Southwest touch adds a sense of magic to the music as well. Really nice to actively listen to, or just have playing in the background.
5734	Addictive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I love this show! Superb acting. It makes me wish I had a crisis management team that I could call on. Kerry Washington is a great actor. The series is addictive. You will love the show after the first five minutes. They pull you in, and it's a wrap. Thank you Shonda Rhimes for another excellent well written drama. It will leave you on the edge of your seat.
5735	Flimsy: This stand is flimsy and pretty small. I used it for a 25' LCD TV and I'm not convinced it would hold. Seems like it works fine for very small tvs.
5736	Missing Lead: The mechanical pencils themselves are great. Have nice grip, light weight, but more than half of the pencils were either missing lead or had none at all. Kinda disappointed that some pencils weren't usable because they didn't have lead.
5737	unreadable: I found this book to be ponderous and, in the end, unreadable. I gave up on it with only 100 pages left to read - I cared that little about what was going to happen to the characters. The book is now in the donation bin of my local public library.
5738	Maxtor makes a good drive, but...: their tech support is terrible. I bought a Maxtor external firewire drive when I was running Windows 98SE. When I experienced installation problems, tech support told me that I either didn't know what I was doing or that I had a bad drive. They (and I mean they) were downright arrogant about it. I returned the drive and bought a Western Digital external firewire drive. Same problem surfaced, but WD's tech support diagnosed the problem in about one minute and gave me the location on their site to download a software patch solution. They told me that the quirk was old news. Neither drive was defective, but Maxtor's service sure was. Five years later, I've learned a lot about PC innards and willingly buy Maxtor drives when the deal is right, but then, I'm no longer dependent on tech support and I assemble my own external drives for about half the price.
5739	This is the best CD you'll ever buy: I was a small boy when my father put this on in his International Scout (it was an 8 track player by the way) and we were on a road trip to the mountains and even better it was at night... and this is the absolute best time to listen to this CD. I recently bought this CD and am still amazed at the way the story is told through music and narration. I don't own a better album.
5740	E.B Gr 7 7R ccps: I think this book was pretty awsome. This book can be exciting at times and also sad at times. The book was boring at some times because there is a bit of talking but other than that is really exciting. I would recomend this book to people 7 and up because there is some hard words but not to hard and I think that people who like guns and killing that this isn't for you because this book is about the mountains and climbing them although some people do get hurt its not blood guts anbd gore.well i wont tell you too much about the book so you will just have to read the book yourself.
5741	Doesn't Work as Advertised: Our little rat terrier attracts fleas like a comic book convention attracts costumed attendees. We've tried several different flea collars, including the HARTZ ULTRA GUARD FLEA AND TICK COLLAR. The box says that this collar is supposed to offer 7-months of protection. It's supposed to kill fleas and ticks and prevent the hatching of flea eggs. The collar does seem to work, but it only lasts for about 2-3 months. After that time, our little dog is once again scratching and biting. Until recently, I was unaware of the multiple lawsuits against the Hartz company. Personally, we've never had an issue with Hartz products, but after reading about the lawsuits, it is something one should be aware. Overall, though the HARTZ ULTRA GUARD FLEA AND TICK COLLAR works, it doesn't work for as long as it says it does. I recommend using a flea and tick collar from a different company.
5742	Won't finish installing: After loading the program, it goes into a setup mode which hangs. I spent hours uninstalling, rebooting the computer, then reinstalling it to no effect. I tried stopping Norton Anti-virus first, but that didn't help. This is the basic version of the program. The full version costs an additional $59.95.
5743	Absolutely do not buy!: The first pump was defective. The merchant replaced it. It also was defective. The merchant handled it excellently, quickly issuing a refund. The product (Chinese made) is lousy. Do not buy! I learned again - - - you get what you pay for.
5744	Loved it, Broke it, Buying another: Awhile back I bought a Coby clock radio that was a piece of junk so I was leery of buying this FM Transmitter. However; based on the reviews for this and other brands I decided to give it a try. Since many people seemed to have trouble getting reception I didn't want to spend a lot of money and have the same problem. Plus, since I use my Garmin a lot I liked the idea of the extra port.The set up was a cinch. The quality was great and it proved to be pretty durable considering is was plugged in and unplugged twice a day and thrown on the floor and most likely stepped on.Then one day for some dumb reason; when I plugged it in; I decided I needed to jiggle the plug like you sometimes have to do with adapter plugs and it just stopped working. I don't know what happened but I blame myself for it and at 17.99 a pop I decided that I could try another.
5745	Funky Californian breakbeats and smooth progressive house.: This is a great album, there are 14 solid tracks taken from Rampant's catalog & mixed by DJ Brownie. It starts out with the classic Ascendance number 'Northern Lights' and progresses through areas of funked out breakbeats (Sedona -'Coast' & The Coffee Boys 'Nipple Fish'), Trippy Techno (Jon Williams-'Much Later') and on to some lethal Progressive House & Trance (Paul Grogan-'The Touch, Paul & Doran-'The Manhattan Beach Project'). If you like fresh sounding dance music that hasn't all been done before then this album is for you.
5746	Nevermore: If your going to get on here, review the DVD's or shut the hell up. I own this DVD and it is just awesome. Some of the matches are brutal and some are just sick. The best match is the hair vs hair against The Franchise. Get this DVD. It is a great one
5747	2 broke out of first 30 used: They are just not reliable. 2 broke out of first 30 used.Break too often.Break too often!I got them from Green Web Inc. through Amazon.
5748	Not for Beginners!: This is the second Elements DVD I have purchased. The first was Beginners Yoga. Neither the Pilates DVD nor the Yoga DVD are truly for *beginners*. If you have NEVER done pilates- if you really want to tone up but are out-of-shape, this DVD is NOT for you. I didn't realize that I had purchased yet another Elements DVD, and I will be more careful NEXT TIME. If you need any sort of modification, she barely addresses this. I think ELEMENTS has gotten truly CONFUSED about the word _BEGINNERS_ - both on their beginning yoga DVD and most certainly on this one. If you are wanting to tone up using pilates and have anything like fibromyalgia - or are just wanting to START a program to tone up in the privacy of your home- I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE. If you've neglected exercise and are not already fairly strong in your abdominal area, you won't even be able to do this DVD. It, as I said, is not for people who are just starting on an exercise program.
5749	Could not get over his arrogance!: I love Georgette Heyer and am quickly reading through her entire works. Most I love and read over and over. There are a few that I just make it through. This is one that I could not even finish. I could not get over Lord Worth's arrogance and overbearing demeaning behavior. And that Judith would fall for him at all! Maybe I missed something. It has been a while since I read this book, but even after all that time, I still felt as if I had to write something. I did not like him and could not watch poor Judith fall in love with him. There are so many other wonderful Georgette Heyer books (try Arabella) that it is a shame to waste any time on this one. Or at the very least, save this one until last to read.
5750	LOTR Review: All three dvds are very entertaining. The adventure is captivating and the special effects are amazing. By far the best trilogy ever made.
5751	Bla!: Bla! That's exatly what this album is about. Her voice is horrible and her songs are so amateur and full of nothing.
5752	Pro-Amway Unsubstantiated Hype: Judging from the time relationship of the release of this book compared to the actual opening of Quixtar, it is blatently obvious that Mr. Barefoot had no practical experience with Quixtar. For the first two-weeks of September, the site was virtually unusable.I suspect that Mr. Barefoot was employed by Amway to write this book under the pretense of being a third party endorsement.Very few facts in this book hold-up under scrutiny!
5753	I love this book: I have read the three first books in this series. I loved them and was eager to read this one too. This book has answered some questions I had about Anneke and Gerda. The history about the Underground Railroad was interesting and it was facinating to see how it impacted the family.
5754	your library has it. Save your time: ...something better. Katharine Weber has created a superficial, amateur, International Intrigue, Freedom & Stuff Like That background to provide Patricia Dolan; a lonely, forty-one year old American woman with a twenty-five year old stud cousin from Ireland named Mickey. He's really interested in Ireland's emancipation from England's domination. So is Dolan, apparently. However, nothing in Weber's development of this character convinces the reader she's motivated by anything more than a good lay with Mickey, absurdly nicknamed, "Mix" during conspiracy pillow talk. Sinn Fein, Mix! Yes, yes, YES! From Ireland with Love...read it & groan...with exasperation.
5755	A bad fit...: The overall features of this product seemed to be just what I was looking for, however, features aside, the unit was a bad fit for me. I was unable to hear beacuse the earpiece would not fit in, or stay in my ear.
5756	Too bad you can't rent this....: It has a few people talking about their experience of moving to Spain from the U.K./Ireland. That's it. Very overpriced.
5757	Fire escape ladders: These ladders are a very economical answer to providing safety to family members and/or tenants living above the ground floor.
5758	No way in hell: Sorry, I want the original, *cleaned up* trilogies, not some outddated laser disc transfer from the 1990's. This DVD is going to be in no way shape or form up to today's standards. Your basically buying a movie that is going to slightly better than your VHS copy of Star Wars. Is that what you want? Sorry but those are the facts.
5759	Dull: This was the hardest book I ever read; not because of difficult language or complexity but sheer volume of endless, ultimately pointless text that muffles the plot. The book's over 300 pages long and very little of note happens until the last 50 or so pages; there are so many characters and storylines that I ended up not caring much about any of them. And the amount of filler is staggering; the author spends several sides explaining the airline policy on stewardesses who are made pregnant by pilots. Of course, the research Hailey has done can't be faulted, and it certainly gives an insight into the running of an airport, but honestly after 200-odd pages of adultery, marital discord, delays, airline stowaways, 'feisty' employees who remove all the capital letters from their typewriters and flippant stewardesses planning seductions in Naples, I really couldn't care less what happened in the end. Don't bother.
5760	ok -: I haver tried to finish reading this book 5 times. It just doesn't hold my interest. I reccommend any other book. Try the Devil Wears Prada or something by Amber Gristak.
5761	grisham was in a hurry: the summons was the worst Grisham book. it seems like he had to fulfill some obligatin to his publisher and hastily wrote this meaningless, forgetful book. the story is weak. and the ending is obvious. i used to trust the 'best selling list' but after seeing that 'the summons' made number one, i will from now on draw my own opinion on what is considered a good book.
5762	He knows every (dirty) trick in the book! What a RIP OFF artist.: I ordered his "FREE" books on TV. I only had to pay (INFLATED) shipping costs. It was to be a present and should have arrived in 4 to 6 weeks. However, 2 months later I called and found the order had NOT been shipped. The gal told me they could not cancel an order but she would rush the books to me. It didn't matter that the event I needed them for was past and I no longer wanted the items. They wanted their "Shipping" money. Now if I do not keep the mis-directed package. Not only will I receive NO refund (I only paid an exorbitant amount on shipping), but I will also have to ship back the books at my own expense! IF you decide to buy this book, buy it used from a seller on Amazon or borrow it from the library and DO NOT bend over for Kevin Trudeau!
5763	Replaced 10 year old: We replaced a 10 year old pump, that we run all year incentral PA, with the same one. It is working fine.
5764	Classicism! Humanism! Catholicism!: Can anyone please explain what the Big H this guy is talking about? The book is as boring as it is incomprehensible.
5765	Non-user friendiness: Factors that contributed to a low rating for this book include, a lack of user-friendliness and lengthy case studies. The blue colored wordings (black would be better) can be quite glaring under the lights making it not smoothing to the eyes.Furthermore, it uses long case studies which could have been shortened by cutting down on the introductions to the companies it made reference to. More focus should be given to concepts at the earlier stage of every section, instead of making the reader running through a lengthy introduction before focusing on the concepts.Important concepts could also have been left out. One example would be the omission of 'Reduced Cost' under the chapters of Linear Programming and Integer Programming.However, this book is certainly catered to users of MS Excel. It has in-depth discussions of Excel in areas of Management Science
5766	decepcionante: Me encantan los libros de Amy Tan y los he leido con mucho gusto y muy rapido, por lo interesantes. Sin embargo este libro se me ha hecho un martirio. Lo sigo leyendo porque no me gusta dejar inconclusa una lectura, pero realmente no logra mantener el interes como los otros.
5767	I hadn't received it yet after two months.: Very poor service. I had not received yet after approximately two months of purchase. I have not received either a reason of the delay. What is going on ?
5768	Good Read: This is a good read. Genesis was a great read so it is a hard compare. Don't let that stop you, though.
5769	Where's the humor?: This is the most humorless Jane Austen adaptation I've seen. Wonderful comic characters such as Mr. Woodhouse, Mrs. Elton and Miss Bates are rendered boring. Pales in comparison to the Gwneth Paltrow version, both in casting, music and wit. I've enjoyed Romola Garai in the past, but here she overacts -- constantly making faces. The location photography while pretty, has no particular style. Biggest complaint: why is this spread over four hours? Hopelessly padded. Johnny Lee Miller is no Jeremy Northam. This production is only adequate.
5770	Let's Hear It For the Venetians!: I just finished reading two Italian mysteries in a row...A Noble Radiance and Medusa. Who would have thought two such attractive characters as Aurelio Zen (Dibdin) and Guido Brunetti (Leon) would appear at the same time?In this latest Dibdin, Zen proves himself a master of the system in which he operates, playing both ends against the middle and the middle against both ends and managing to achieve a kind of rough justice.Wouldn't it be fun if Dibdin and Leon would collaborate on an adventure?
5771	A good laugh: C'mon, honestly any fool would know better than to purchase this. Just play the clips and you'll see why. This should be in the comedy section.
5772	Rarely used and it died: I actually liked this product but didn't use it very often..just to blend/make soups on occasion. I was using it to blend carrot soup where the carrots were all cooked down. It suddenly stopped. I thought maybe it just overheated and set it aside and didn't think anything of it. Then a month and a half later I picked it up to blend and it wouldn't turn on. Tried different outlets to make sure it wasn't the outlet - no, it's the product. Completely dead and it's pretty much brand new!! It's just 2 years old, hardly used (but of course out of warranty).
5773	NEVER GOT THE TOY: WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED ON CHRISTMAS MORNING BECAUSE YOUR STORE DIDN'T DELIVER AND DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO TELL US IT COULDN'T UNTIL THE 27TH. MY DAD BETTER GET HIS MONEY BACK OR HE'S GOING TO BE PISSED. I ALREADY AM
5774	Perfect book to train little serial killers...: Wow. Someone gave this book to our kids, and I had no idea what it was about til I was reading it to them. Why on Earth would someone want to write a book about chopping chickens up, carrying their dismemebered parts home, and then terrifying fellow students - and a teacher! - by having a boy stick dismembered chicken parts on his hands at school?!?This book is really, really sick. I threw our copy away. No way would I resell it and have some other unsuspecting kids exposed to the cruelty found in this disgusting "children's" book. (And I'm a liberal who is opposed to banning books!)
5775	Fly Fishing Through the Midlife Crisis: This book puts it all together, lifes high and low spots, our successes and failures, and the drive to overcome the challenges presented by these situations. It makes one realize that there is a degree of "The Redneck Way" in all of us.
5776	wedding cs: this is one of them cds you only listen to one time and thats for the wedding well that's what i did work great thanks
5777	McLintock!: The dvd was terrible. It skipped spots and "got stuck" on various frames at least 50 times. The movie is very long to begin with, and the issue of getting stuck on a frame made it even longer and very irritating. This is the first time I have had any problems with anything I bought from the Amazon.com site though.
5778	The BEST Ever Hands Down: This is the greatest album ever made, hands down. If you listen to music you should already have this album no matter what kind of music you like.
5779	Chemists do now understand why egg whites beat best in copper: Cookwise by Shirley O. Corriher explains the chemistry involved in the use of a copper bowl for beating egg whites. Corriher is a better read than McGee. This copper bowl is probably as good as any you are likely to find for under fifty dollars. If you don't want to mess with removing the varnish, find a band instrument repair shop who can do it for you.
5780	A Holistic Approach: A recent magazine article about Nelson's success sparked my interest in his methods. I acquired the The Incredible Payback to learn more of Nelson's purchasing and supplier development experiences and ideas. In this book, he details how these functions can improve the financial health of a business. His presentation is clear and comprehensive, covering many practices that have led both him and others to success. He shares cost reductions resulting from the implementation of these practices. He explains the critical role of software relative to his purchasing and supply chain management vision. I'm eager to apply the ideas that Nelson has presented.
5781	heartfelt: Our family has enjoyed this cd. I was just introduced to this group even though they have been around for a while. you need to search out all their albums. some songs are not as good as others. Thanks to Amazon givin a little listen before you bye. If you love good strong voices, harmony and a little southren gospel mixed with contemporay sound this is for you!
5782	Came nowhere near rated hours: Not much to say about these. They light the room like a bulb should but most of them have failed within a few months. I've seen this with numerous FEIT electric CFL products I've purchased from Costco over the years. They all seem to fail well before their rated hours.
5783	Indispensable Accessory: An absolute necessity when keeping the OEM radio and utilizing modern sound equipment in a vintage vehicle. Quality, professional look at an affordable price.
5784	warning: I don't know if it was just me but everything I had heard and read about this book lead me to expect a much different story. The book is not about a non-traditional family. Its about very different, somewhat disturbed people dealing with their neurosis and never really winning. I've come to find Cunningham's work pretty stark, brutal, and somewhat dark and this is by far the best example of that. If you liked the darker, macabre aspects of The Hours this is for you.In a positive note though and the reason this gets 2 stars from me - Michael is a STELLAR writer. I'm sure his shopping list is a touching piece of literature!
5785	Avent fan except for warmer!!: I LOVE the Avent bottles, liners, nipples and steriler but the bottle warmer concerned me because the 3 levels all seemed to warm the same, there was no timer to tell how long bottle had been in (my milk got way too hot) and the advertised 4 minutes for heat up time is not necessarily accurate according to the instruction manual. This is the only Avent product that I have used that I am totally disappointed in and that I have returned to the store.
5786	major let-down: I purchased this drive in September '08 and it crashed less than two months later. No warning signs--drive just failed. I was shocked because the Seagate name was highly recommended by a friend. Sure, the drive had an extra-long warranty and sure this could happen with any brand, but still a major pain in the ### dealing wih the aftermath. Fortunately I had all of my info backed up on an external HD. Less than two months out of this drive is ridiculous, after all, this is not a no-name company. Strangely enough, the drive that failed before this one was a Maxtor (which is also manfactured by Seagate). Seagate's customer service was not very helpful.
5787	Top Does Not Fit: Length:: 0:43 MinsThe top of the pitcher does not fit correctly as demonstrated in this video.
5788	Good: This book gives one insight into what it is like to be a special ed teacher. The author also explains what type of problems one could expect to encounter in the profession, and ways of dealing with them. It would be a good book for anyone interested in becoming a special ed teacher, parents of special ed students, and politicians who have the power to change the system. There were however many gramatical and spelling errors which made the book confusing at times.
5789	These Little Boys have no Talent: I recently bought this album and I have to admit that I have heard better. Nsync has proved a major point: its easy for guys who can't play musical intruments to jump aroung and lip synch.
5790	Great product IF you do the following: Nice to know the beans are staying fresh..nice to hear the air swhoosh out but who wants to replace the batteries every few days because they skimped on the seal which allows air to enter and requires to batteries to activate to recreate the vaccum. I thought the interior cannister might seal better if it were a bit taller so i put about 8 of those small felt furniture pads on the bottom of the cannister and it seems to have done the trick...no batteries dying for a week now.
5791	Probably not for healthy bottoms: Received this as a gift from a relative at the birth of our son. Truth be told, it works well as a warmer: we used with the washcloths provided and moistened Quickables. The sponge at the bottom keeps everything moist and warm.But our son developed a persistent diaper rash within a week, and after weeks of trying to get it cleared up (thanks, Zinc Oxide and Lotrimin), we decided to stop using the warmer for wipes since it was just a incubator for yeast and bacteria. Going back to (cold) wet wipes, he is now perfectly happy and not a blemish on his bum.
5792	Sonic 2 Game Gear Review: It Was In Great Condition And Played Like It Did Years Ago And It's Lots Of Fun To Play.
5793	A man true to himself..definition of an Artist: I read an online review that discribed this as elevator music. I've been a prince fan for years mainly because he refused to be placed in a mold. Many assume that if his music differs from what first attracted thier first listen then he is slipping. Each of princes albums has been a creation, a creation from the start, which means he took the time to recreate his mold for every album. To me that defines him as one of the greatist musical artists of our time. I will admit I have not felt all of his work but I respected it. As far as NEWS goes I've felt every note and believe me this ranks up the there with his top musical creations. Thanks Prince for inspiring creative minds.
5794	Good Place to Store things: The installation was really easy and moving the "stuff" I don't really use much above my head is making my life easier. The only problem I have is I couldn't use all the possible space because my garage door opens and leaves me only enough space to put this product on its highest setting. I would really like to extend it but I wouldn't be able to open my garage door over and over without taking it down. I plan on buying another one however and put it where the garage door doesn't cause it problems. I bought at Amazon because Home Depot only carried the smaller one and it was the same price.
5795	A Must Have for Preschoolers!: A fun way to teach your preschooler about the letters and their sounds.... My 2 year old grand daughter can't stop watching it... And she knows many of the letters and their sounds. I am VERY impressed with this product and will be investigating more of the leap frog products.
5796	HIStory Vol 2: Michael Jackson - History on Film, Vol. 2This is a beautiful tribute to a part of Michael Jackson's career. He hand picked each piece and made it for his fans to cherish. He took his God given gifts and fine tuned them into the magnificent King of Pop that will live forever as long as we continue to play his music and watch his videos. He captured our hearts because his own heart was bigger than any person I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. His music and dancing will live on forever as long as we listen to his songs and watch his short films. I don't want the world to forget this beautiful creature who took the basics of entertaining and catapulted them into the moves we've been attempting to copy for years. He was a wonderful Father, a Fabulous Entertainer and One of a kind; and he was my friend. I miss you Michael.
5797	Awesome: Even if your not a Prince fan, this album will blow you away if your a music lover. His arrangements and the level of perfection on this album is out of this world.You just dont know what he'll do next on every song. The solo's, the breaks, the singing and musicianship is one of the best I've heard on one single album. You also get the feeling that they are enjoying it, yet so disciplined and organised. None of the songs are overplayed and even the tracks that are over 7 or 8 minutes keep you on the egde waiting for more magic. This album is worth every penny. Buy it.
5798	Harmonica Blues: They sound halfway decent for the first day or so, then they go flat. Alright for a use once and throw away $2.00 harmonica.
5799	Not what they used to be: I have been wearing this shirt for 10 years, the last couple of years the quality and sizing has been horrible. Some shirts are shorter than others, some shrink really bad, now the material thickness is thinner. I wish they would increase the price rather then drop the quality if they need to keep there profit margin the same.
5800	Latin influenced rock and blues...: An interesting collection of Latin influenced rock and blues. Mostly Los Lobos along with Santana, Link Wray, Dire Straits among others. Tito of Tito and Tarantula is the lead guy from The Cruzados.
5801	Relief From Self-Effort!: This book is a rich resource for believers. I think it should be read and reread yearly, as a reminder of all that we have 'in Christ'. Nee breaks down the meaning of the cross and allows the reader to reconsider what the 'exchanged life' really means.
5802	What to do: I purchased this book as a reference. I would rate myself as a crochet beginner and always have questions. This book has answered each as they popped up. Already paid for itself in gas savings to my usual Q&A location.
5803	This edition of House of Cobwebs: Customers please be advised: This edition of House of Cobwebs (ISBN 1419166700) contains ONLY the story titled House of Cobwebs, followed by many blank pages to make up the volume. It is not the collection of stories by Gissing of the same title. Save your money and get one of the otoher editions.
5804	Well, what can I say: I like to read books from both sides of the isle. It gives a person a better chance of truly knowing what is going on with in the political parties. My problem with many of the political books out there is that many of the authors continue to "lump" everyone into the same category. Life isn't like that. People aren't like that. Everyone thinks independently, and each side has it's own extremists. I didn't even make it half way through this book before I trashed it. Though, I will say, MM is not nearly as painful to read as Ann Coulter.
5805	Good Product but Shop Locally First: I have being using Wahl trimmers for ear hair, nose hair, and eyebrows for years and find they are better than the others. However a week after beginning to use this product I found a 3 in 1 Wahl trimmer at our local Drug Emporium store that has an interchangable round head for nose and ear, reciprocating head, and an eyebrow attachment for the reciprocating head for trimming eyebrows evenly. It was just about the same price as this model from Amazon but is much more functional.
5806	Better than the waterbottle sibling: I use this every Texas winter season for my coffee. I brew and drink black so I don't have any problems with sugar or cream clogging up the mechanics. Washes easy and keeps my coffee piping hot and in the tumbler.Contigo did this one right. I have the Autoseal water bottle and it's not nearly as resilient as this tumbler.
5807	Totally awesome :): This book is great! All the illustrations were beautiful and depicted very accurately. There were even Greek and Roman colum designs, and even Greek chariots designs! There were also ancient Egptian clothing, this book is full of bonuses! :)
5808	You have GOT to get this book!!!: Not very long ago, I was NOT a superstar in the music business. Then I read this book. Now, I am still not a superstar, but I am out twelve bucks! GET THIS BOOK, DAWG!!!
5809	Interesting collection: A collection of short stories and essays (and even a poem) on the possibility of using a solar-sail as a mean of inter-planatary travel. Written by masters like Niven, Clark, Brin & Anderson, this book cannot be bad. The stories are interesting, and the book is not too long that the premise begins to become annoying. Maybe the theme is a bit forced at some points. All in all, one of many other good sci-fi collections.
5810	Great product that will make your shredder work way better!: Having been through several different shredders before and never used lubrication, this product is a miracle. I decided to purchase it after buying a more expensive shredder on Amazon that I wanted to extend the life of. I shred after every basket and I can immediately tell the difference when these sheets are used. The shredder doesn't seem to need to work as hard and can shred more sheets at a time without struggling.This product makes it simple to do regular shredder maintenance and is a must-have. Another thought: why don't shredder companies make their products with built-in lubrication systems that have replaceable components akin to a printer?
5811	Xbox iGlow Wireless Controller 2 Pack: I purchase this wireless remote to replace another set of wireless remote for my xbox. I am completely happy with the design and the range and precision of the controllers. The receiver for each controller fits perfectly in the xbox and there is no wire hanging out; it attaches directly to the xbox. The only issue I had at first was that I did not like the fact each controller uses 4 AAA batteries, but after playing for over 2 weeks with same batteries that feeling was a thing of the past. I recommend you buy the 15 minute AA/AAA energizer charger, it will be of great help. If you are looking a wireless controller I will recommend this 2 controllers pack so you can also enjoy night-play under beautiful glow/illumination.
5812	an immense story: THE DAY THE WORLD CAME TO TOWN is a little book with a huge story to tell about that September day in 2001, when 38 jetliners, carrying over 6500 souls (plus a small zoo of animals in their holds!) came home to roost on an island with its own time zone in a land of Good Samaritans, because the world as we knew it had changed forever.RebeccasReads recommend THE DAY THE WORLD CAME TO TOWN as one of those immense stories from our collective 9/11 experience of how our neighbors to the north took us in & cared for us. It is also the modern global inter-connectedness that glows from Jim DeFede's gathering of the strands of people's lives into a braid of fear, compassion & gratitude.
5813	Fine cast wasted on dreck.: Working my way through the Michael Caine canon. This was just rubbish dressed up as social commentary. So many egregious plot holes I can't begin to list them. Omar Sharif should be ashamed of himself for playing a stereotyped lustful rich A-rab. And Michael Caine's eyes looked like no one was home, which isn't surprising after weeks of shooting in desert wasteland, directed by someone whose bad taste in music has to be heard to be believed. The camels were amusing, however.
5814	A big disappointment: I am an avid Mary Black fan, but I have to say that this one was a big disappointment. Not only is Declan Sinnott conspicuous by his abscence, but the percussion here is way too overbearing. It doesn't fit with the subtlety and beauty of Mary's lilting voice, no matter what kind of song she is delivering. Apparently producer Larry Klein isn't aware of that. Definitely not up to par with her other work.
5815	Informative: I bought this book when my child was 4 months old and I wish I would have gotten it while I was pregnant. It's very informative and just reiterated that babies begin learning in the womb. Great purchase for new & expecting mothers!
5816	Not happy with quality of product: I bought this about one month ago. Everything seemed fine and then all of a sudden it seemed like the battery kept dying. Well batteries do not die after just being changed. Now I know this thing is junk. I have tried to contact seller with no luck. Hoping maybe for an exchange. Would like to disregard my previous positive rating. Shipping was fast but product is junk. Next time I will pay more for good quality.
5817	Do Not Buy This Product: Read the reviews on this product and note the common thread. For us, the lifespan for this unit was about 4 months. After that, it would no longer hold a charge. I cleaned the contacts and tried to re-initialize it with an additional 16 hour charge. It continued to die within seconds. Since I knew the unit was headed for the trash, I opened it up to see what was inside. It was full of mold. So an item that is designed to hold and dispense water isn't even sealed well enough to protect from ordinary use. The battery, of course, is soldered in and impossible to replace. In short, this is a poorly designed piece of junk. Do not buy this product!
5818	not happy: this product arrived opened and missing a suction.....i was very disappointed with this purchase.
5819	You'll get much less than what you pay for: I was looking for decent spotted spoon and saw these. 44 pieces for $15 seems bargain but I was not expecting in good quality either. Actually, thsese are much worse than what I expected. The edges of the plastic spoons are peeling right out of the box. All items feel very low quality. There's no description those spoons are good for heat. I'm returning mine.I can't believe I got such quality in the United States!! Purchase these only if you want to cook at a beach house for a weekend and left them forever... like disposals.
5820	the concert was off the hook!: I haven't even seen the video yet, but I know it will be the bomb. I was at her recording and that was an amazing experience all by itself. I encourage everyone to buy the video because it is something that you don't want to miss! I know I will own my own copy. God Bless
5821	buying cornball: i rated this product as very funny, if you like country humor and ray stevens, this is it. price was right, and will buy again.
5822	Good overview of the season: This was my first year of purchasing the annual Baseball America Almanac. In the past I had purchased other guides and almanacs, but always passed over the Baseball America due to loyalty to other guides. Well, now my loyalty is to Baseball America's annual Almanac.What do you get with this? A complete review of the MLB season, from off-season moves, regular season results and post-season results. You also get a team by team review which includes all of the minor league statistics. This is definitely a nice resource if you want to have an idea of who the next stars could be. But, the alamanac is not overwhelmed with statistics. The articles are well written by a variety of sports writers who cover each team.
5823	anointed worship song: Amazing, anointed songs - HILLSONG has great gift from Heaven.Alleluja!One practical issue - front page and the song book has been attached from other release "Saviour King", I had to print out by myself.
5824	great concert: Watching this was easy like going down memory lane. I wish that it would have just been the concert without all the other stuff going on but still a great dvd
5825	Complete Piece of Garbage!!!: Worthless. Half the time it doesn't work -- picks up other monitors, or doubles your heart rate, or doesn't show one, or shows a ridiculously low one. Nice, when it works, but completely unreliable. Don't waste your money.
5826	Great if you don't carry an encyclopedia: I got this backpack about a month ago. The backpack has a lot of pockets and it is very functional. The notebook pocket is well padded and large enough for my 15.4 inch wide-screen Dell. My only concern is the durability of the nylon. The texture is not so flexible, paper like feeling, and it doesn't appear the texture is as strong as a typical student's Jansport backpack. I'm a bit hesitant to put my heavy science textbook in addition to a laptop in this backpack. Overall, this is a great backpack if you don't put heavy stuff regularly.Update -July 27, 2008I found the main zipper's seam started falling apart. Besides of laptop, I haven't put that heavy stuff past seven months. As I mentioned before, this backpack may not be as rugged as it appears.
5827	Product is great; pricing is annoying: I love the Litter Locker system, and these refills were cheaper online than in the store. If only the price didn't vary so often! I needed to order more, so I came back to amazon and they'd jacked the price up. I wound up ordering a multi-pack from another seller because it was significantly cheaper. I know that's part of the amazon game, but I don't want to play games with something that holds cat poop.
5828	NOT WORTH THE MONEY, YUCK!: I love Rachael Ray. I love her enthusiasm, her moxie, just her good 'ole zest for life. She is fun to watch and gets you really involved in the meal at the same time urging you to try new things.She should not have published this cookbook.The ideals in it are nice. Cook with your kids, teaching, learning etc. etc. Create some wholesome family time etc. etc. ABSOLUTELY.Great ideas, great concepts.HORRIBLE RECIPES.Seriously, just plain bad.I am an uneducated semi-gourmet cook. Meaning, I am an excellent cook, everyone has always loved my food and I can cook just about anything under the sun (with or without recipes), BUT, I have not been to culinary school.Even so, these are terrible recipes!!!!!They not only taste terrible, they don't make alot of culinary sense.I am not bashing Rachael. Just this cookbook.Don't waste your money folks, look elsewhere, but continue to cook with your kids, it is time well spent!
5829	As bright as u need it to be!: I noticed a cool feature that I don't think ayone else mentioned. If your house has lights on faders, then you'll notice too that this little light fades up and down proportionally to how bright the surrounding area is! Meaning: as u turn down your lights, the emergency light gets brighter. Nifty!
5830	very Russian: This program is very Russian. They have taken the Christie plot and produced it in a totally Russian style. The only English things about the production is that some of the men wear vests with their suits or smoke pipes. Also the "English" subtitles are literal translations from Russian in Russian grammar. These are amusing. The end of the story is very morbid in the Russian style.The only improvement I could think of is that they should have woven excerpts from "Pictures at an Exhibition" into the sound track.
5831	Boring Waste of Prescious Resources: If you want great fantasy as opposed to poor, read George RR Martin's series instead.Martin's characters and plot are both interesting-something lacking in this overdrawn boring series.If you enjoy reading pages of description irrelevant to the plot, you may enjoy this series. If suffering from sleep deprivation, read this series but keep a barf bag nearby.Comparing this series to the classics demonstrates a unfamiliarity with the classics and is an insult to the classics.
5832	Just what I was looking for!: Needed a laminator for crafts and business laminating--something that could hold up under multiple laminating jobs. I've had it for about 2 years now and it is working in tip top shape.
5833	Overall a good product: I ordered two of these and it does exactly what it is supposed to do as detailed in the written description.
5834	One of my favorites: I love this book. It is transports you to the sea by which the last unicorn must stand. If you've seen the movie, you must read the book. If you've not seen the movie, then please read the book. This is a great read for pre-teens all the way through adults.
5835	Hilarious??: I take exception to those who deemed this book "hilarious"...far from it. I rated the book one star, not because of the talent that it took to produce it, but because the content is so shockingly painful to read. It was like trying to watch someone perform surgery on themselves. This is supposed to be funny?? Why? I know animals who are treated with more care and love than the narrator of this memoir. And I should be laughing over this....I think not.
5836	BORING: The problem with remakes is if you stick too close to the original without using creativity it can just be terribly boring. If you exercise creative liberty in the remake, the other group is indignant.Well here you have the boring. The original was actually much better and more intense. The girl actress was just annoying, Jeff Bridges was trying to channel his John Wayne, just made for an awful duo. Did the Coen brothers really make this one?
5837	jay z................. fake thug: last album he said he was done with crime and drugs. No one was feeling that. He is back now talking more ---- than ever.
5838	Yikes! Don't get these: I bought two boxes to use with my sixth grade science class. NO two of them agree on a temperature when they were put into a tub of room temp water.Some of them registered a temp below freezing in our heated classroom.
5839	inexcusable mistake: i stopped reading and lost all respect for the author early in the book when after shooting the greaseball in his ny restaurant the hero goes to wash off the gunshot residue with soap and water. he just washes his hands and forearms.every child knows that gsr traces adhere to clothes, hair, the face etc. so here we have a professional assassin looking like a rank amateur. not really convincing
5840	Rip Off: &#65279;This book is a rip off. It's basically an extra large print 94 page infomercial for whoever ponies up to the publisher. Here's the gimmick. The author goes on and on about the dangers of indoor pollution and all the harm it can cause and states along with anonymous testimonials that the author has found the solution. The number to call to order the "solution" which is an un-named air purifier can be found on the last page of the book. No where does the name of the air purifier manufacturer appear in the body of the book. In fact it didn't appear on the last page of my book either where the words "your sticker here" appeared. Apparently, manufacturers are to pay for the right to have their product's name appear on a sticker placed on the last page. I guess no one paid for the right for the book I bought. This book should not be sold by Amazon.
5841	Do Not Buy: The book is filled with great pictures, but the techniques are poorly described, and sometimes are not described at all. I've tried several recipes and all of them have been missing steps that the book assumes you already know. My sponge cake for example could have been used for a spare tire, not sure what happened there! I've used some of the ideas in the book, but have gone to other cookbooks for the actual recipes! This book was not worth the money.
5842	Best sweats I've every worn.: These are the best sweats I or my hubby have ever worn.> They hold up well to washings (color does not fade, very little pilling if at all, very minor shrinkage, hardly noticable).> Pockets are roomy and deep.> No elastic at bottom is great and comfy.> Top elastic is very comfortable, and includes inner string if you need to make them tighter.> Very comfortable and soft from top to bottom. Can sleep in them easily.> Light weight but not "cheap" feeling. Perfect for in the house all year, or outdoor spring/summer use.> XL fits someone 5'9" to 6'2" easily in length, and from 190 lbs up to 275 lbs.> XXL (2XL) fits up to about 330 lb man or woman, fitting a little snug after 300 lbs, but not so tight so as to be uncomfortable.As of 2012 we've now used this brand and style for over 4 years w/o having to replace them for wearing out. The only reason we have replaced them was not because they wore out, we just needed a new size as we both go up and down in size very often.
5843	Fun and Informative: This book was a pleasant surprise. I expected the dry recitation of facts and adequate photography of the average collector's book, but that's not what I got. The narrative is fun, with much of the primary author's personality shining through, and the photography is lovely.The book is beautifully designed. Literary quotes about jewelry and a sense of a personal connection with the authors enhance the text. I found myself reading the entire book instead of just looking up the parts I wanted to know about. The information is thorough and detailed.Since this is the first text on antique enamel, one would expect it to do well among collectors, but this exceeds those expectations and will be an asset to anyone in the antique business.
5844	great cd: Thoroughly enjoyed this recording and enthusiastically recommend it to all. All the players did a great job. I especially liked the playfulness of the flute/bass duet and thought that the Barnett was the perfect foil to the Schuller.It's heartwarming to know that some of the proceeds will go to such a good cause.Bravo.... Encore!Matt Nix
5845	Perfectly fit for who: As a former athlete who's fallen away in the last few years, I found this book was not as worthwhile as I had wanted. I think I'd have to do these exercises WAY more than 8 weeks to get back in shape. A bit unrealistic given the types of exercises that are presented.
5846	A great purchase: My cats and I love the Drinkwell Platinum fountain, we've had it for over a year and no problems.
5847	This item is overpriced at Amazon: If you go to the Panasonic website, you will see this listed at $199! Don't even think about paying the $300. "discounted" price here without checking other places...
5848	original was better: i had the original release.. and dont know what the hell this 2006 version is.. does dave really think people wanted to hear him ruin the lyrics.. get over yourself dave.. it was a side project.. now it just sounds like another new megadeth album.. dont get me wrong.. i am a big megadeth fan.. i just think this new release is an insult to the original.. i wouldnt waste my money on this new version..
5849	DO NOT RECOMMEND!: First, let me start by saying that the quality of this costume SUCKS. It's scratchy and too simple to be anything more than a gray piece of fabric. It is also a 4T. It says 2T-4T but the costume clearly has a 4T size on it when you get it. Would not have fit my 2 year old. I returned the product and paid my own shipping. Then, the company charged me a 25% "restocking fee" on top the shipping I paid to have it sent and the shipping I paid to send it back. So basically I paid an extra $30 for NOTHING. *****DO NOT BUY THIS!**** The "Cuddly Elephant costume" also sold on Amazon is much more cute and soft!
5850	A profoundly humane memoir: Margarete Buber-Neumann (the daughter-in-law of Martin Buber) was a young German Communist in the 1920s who was active in her union of department-store clerks. When the Nazis came to power, she fled to Moscow -- where Stalin's regime condemned her as a spy and sent her to a gulag. When Hitler and Stalin entered into their Non-Aggression Pact in 1939, the Soviets handed her over to the Gestapo, and she was sent to the Ravensbrueck concentration camp. Miraculously, she survived. This poignant memoir describes the author's journey through the different camps and populations of inmates, with an abundance of memorable characters and moving stories along the way.
5851	campy: If you like cars, chase scenes and the occasional T & A and don't mind bad acting these are the movies for you. Because they are old, I think from the late 60s early 70s they are a bit nostalgic for those of us from a certain age, so they are fun to watch.
5852	Did the job!: Nice costume for the price. Wasn't disappointed at all. Had some extra stings handing off seams but nothing a pear of sizzers couldnt fix. Would recommend to friends!
5853	See this book for what it is.: All this book is written to do is Monday morning quarterback a situation that nobody could have dealt with flawlessly. Giuliani did the best he could at the time and under the circumstances. This book serves as a political hit piece by people who would be critical of the man because of his politics and not because of his proven track record. In my opinion there is hardly anything in the book that stands up as honest and deserved criticism, and the things that do are acceptable to me considering the situation.In my opinion the authors knew darn well that if Giuliani runs for President, they would get all the interviews and book sales their hearts could want.
5854	Terrible writing...: The premise of this book is interesting, but the vehicle just doesn't work. COME ON...Ms. Pettersson writes like a 5th grader. I mean...blind date?!?! Disinherited ?!?! GIVE ME A BREAK.... I mean, if the heroine is so bad-as* why hasn't she ever told her jerk of a "father" to go jump in a lake?! So she can keep living on his dime and not get a job? That way she can continue wandering the streets of Las Vegas every night. Whatever.
5855	worst hearts of palm: I found this product to be inedible. Mushy, and texturally wrong. Too large and two few tightly packed into can. Really bad.
5856	Nothing good to say except: "They're shiny!": This review is targeted towards fingerstyle guitar players that are looking for an alternative to their fingernails to play rock, alternative, Spanish, or classical music on an acoustic guitar with metal strings. Don't buy these picks.I was hoping metal picks would be a simple and durable alternative to maintaining fingernails that can easily break. These picks look great in the box but once on your fingers, you lose all the touch and some of the tone your fingernails provide. After you get used to the feel of a foreign body on your fingertips, plucking the thicker strings (6E, 5A, 4D) sound fine. However, using these picks on the thinner strings (3G, 2B, 1E) adds a horrible metal scratching sound to the plucks (very noticeable particularly when playing quieter notes) - unacceptable.I'm going to stick with using fingernails to play - I suggest you do the same.
5857	Too confusing: This book aimed to be revolutionary, but is too confusing and becomes less and less interesting throughout the pages. If you want to read something enjoyable... choose another book.
5858	Ugh....: As an avid reader, when I first read about this book in a local news story, I was excited to read it not only because it sounded good, but because I live in the area where the book is set. Now, about 100 pages into it, I wonder why I am still reading it at all. The characters are underdeveloped, the story is boring and whoever edited or proof read this book should be fired. The only reason I have for finishing this book is that I have never stopped reading a book because I didn't like it. Also, I want to see how much more cliched it can get. Whichever reviewer said Ms. Curran was following in Stephen King's footsteps, I feel, is mistaken. Ms. Curran should perhaps read Mr. King's book about writing and learn a few things.
5859	Was this a comedy?: This movie was not what I had expected from all the actors and contributors. There was no one in the movie you really cared about in the end as they all disppoint. And a dracula puppet opera - really???
5860	Scale makes a great bookend.: The product arrived promptly and there was no visible signs of damage. After reading the instruction sheet on how sensitive this scale is supposed to be, I came to the conclusion something had to be miss wired or? I have yet to return the scale, but this request for a review will prompt me to do so.
5861	Original Music with a Florida Flair: I'm a folk music fan, so a review in the Orlando Sentinel for this caught my eye. "Banks of the Old St. Johns" (on this album) earned Spears the 1997 Will McLean Award for best new song about Florida's people, places or history. The CD includes 12 songs with "an impressive combination of economical wordplay and simple, evocative melodies." Allan Stowell, who has played with Gamble Rogers and Will McLean, accompanies Spears.If you like fiddle and mandolin plus orignial songs, then this should get your attention.
5862	The reed of choice for music teachers: I am a music teacher working with beginning students and they go through a lot of reeds before they learn how to keep them from breaking. Rico reeds are consistent, affordable, and easy to get. Amazon has a good price, and they get them to me quick.
5863	Loose Lips Sink Ships: This film has two very gorgeous, sensual actors in steamy love scenes that are vaguely interesting. At first I wondered how close this might have been to receiving an X Rating. Their lips seemed like the focal point of the film, and it seemed a finger was always going into the others mouth or into their own. Jarring scene changes, choppy edits, dizzying camera work, and at times, unnecessary tricks, all failed to add purpose to the plot. All this to frenetic cuban music, which was good, as was the scenery, whick mostly consisted of balconies and white curtains blowing in the wind. The low point was a scene that involved spitting, you'll know what I mean when you see it. The high point was watching a person make such a sniveling idiot of himself. The two of them are not hard to look at. I'll be dreaming of fingers and lips all night.
5864	Cheap Printer: This printer is no frills and does a good job on smooth CDs, however it's printing on textured CDs is unacceptable. Because the product description does not tell you this I have no choice but to give it 1 star. I bought a stack of 100 blank CDs and also 50 blank DVDs (I have not received the DVDs yet and hope they are not textured) and the money I saved by getting this no frills printer has now been wasted.If it weren't for this downfall the printer would be deserving of 4 stars.
5865	Just for kids: If your kids are Harry Potter fans, they will like this or any other movie about Harry Potter.For any other person who wishes to see a quality movie and not a character legend, this is a bad, boring, absurd and a waste of time.
5866	Philip Yancey Is Amazing!: Author Philip Yancey offers a refreshing viewpoint of grace in his spiritually challenging book What's So Amazing About Grace? He effectively uses the scriptures as a lens to focus on the life we lead today. His illustrations help the reader to turn that lens on himself or herself - not in a critical way, but in a soul-opening way. He has chosen some of the most startling and effective illustrations I have ever encountered. This book, already being used in our Christian colleges, needs to be required reading for anyone who takes his or her Christian life seriously.
5867	Not Airtight, flimsy: The vittles vault, although it looked like a definite winner, was not airtight. Not sure if this was an issue for everyone, but with my vault if you squeeze on the side a bit it will expel and bring back in air. After further inspection, the sides of my vittles vault will not clamp all the way down. Even if forced to do so, the clips just pop back off. For this reason I am giving it a 2 star rating, as it is not much more than an expensive rubbermaid tote at this point. Really wanted to like this, but I can't with this kind of QC.Update: 9/12/12The clips on the container are starting to break off at the seam of the clip. This container has been carefully opened only about 10 times...... Very poor product. Will avoid this brand in future purchases
5868	Paints a good picture: My boys and I read this together for our T.O.G. curriculum. It is told well and includes enough pictures so that my 10, 8 & 6yr. old got a good idea of what their life may have been like if lived during that time. Be careful to never buy a copy that has any looseness in its binding.
5869	great oldies game: This one is for you, if you like oldies.Great game, came out before Abe's Exoddus. It a bit harder that it's predecessor.I don't know though why was I sent 2 copies of this game(return was impossible, since I live on a different continent and other blah-blah :) )Also, works on Vista Ultimate 32bit.
5870	didn't even want it, but...: Alas. I do not print in color, only black ink, as I only print words. However, while older printers do print in black only, and even my computer can give the order to print black only, modern printers demand that you must put in color ink. Even when it only uses black. The cartrige that came with the printer somehow grew empty over 4 years and refused to print, until I put this new color cartrige in.So I can't even tell you if it works or not, just that with it in, the black ink now prints.
5871	different packaging from earlier release: This is great stuff and it's nice to see it available again since it has been out of print for a long time. Since the product description is so minimal, however, you should just know before you order that the reissue version skimps mightily on the packaging compared to the ecstatic peace version from several years back. Again, if all you care about is the music, it is the same, but it's just not as nice of a fetish object as the original.
5872	Great for improving your birds life!!: This book categorises parrot personalities and describes 11 types of toys that will suit their individual traits. It then offers ideas for safely making these toys.My birds seem to be so much happier having a variety of toys that are designed specifically for their needs.My only gripe is the book provides diagrams for making bird gyms etc, but doesn't give any pictures or diagrams for the home-made toys.
5873	Elementary School disappointment: I purchased 3 of these machines and none of them have stood the "heavy duty" test. We have 600 plus students and obviously go through many pencils. The inexpensive pencil sharpeners that were purchased are still going although they have to "rest" occasionally but the "heavy duty" sharpeners just break. I'm very disappointed and frustrated.X-Acto High-Volume Commercial Electric Pencil Sharpener, Beige, 1 Unit (1606)
5874	Excellent product: The delivery was prompt, and the hat was as described. This was purchased as a gift. The recipient loved the hat and started wearing it immediately
5875	Great for preemies: This monitor has worked very well for motion sensing but not great for sound due to the poor audio quality. However, we purchased a Sony BabyCall for the sound and now use both together. The motion sensor is AWESOME! I've never had a false alarm and it always goes off after 20 seconds on those occasions when I've forgotten to turn it off after removing her from the crib. I do have to agree with everything Graham wrote in his review about the design. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars. Even with the design flaws, it is well worth it for the peace of mind!
5876	Wasn't as great as I expected: After I found out in Nitindo Power it was one of the players choices and it was the top selling video game, I rented it from Blockbuster, it was less than I expected. It's like you can't beat it without going to muliplayer, what if you have no one else to play with? It doesn't give you any clues on how to do stuff. I'm glad I didn't buy it.
5877	No one suspects ....: ..... I keep my 10 million in Exxon/Mobil stock certificates hidden in my cleverly disguised Das Kapital lock box. Highly recommended for wealthy capitalists.
5878	It Happened to Nancy: It Happened to Nancy is one of the best books of all time.Heart breaking, compelling, it is a must read. A 14 yearold girl gets date raped, and later finds she has HIV.Reading this book, it is hard to remember that it was atrue story, and is happening right now. A definate musthave.
5879	Great movie! One of the best!: I absolutely LOVE this movie! I first watched this movie on the Disney Channel when I was 5 years old, and it was one of the first movies I watched and actually liked back then, this and Care Bears. It might sound kinda crazy, since I'm 13, but there's a few things about Rainbow Brite that I like. First, the characters are really cute, especially the sprites, and the animation and music is great. I watched a few of the old Rainbow Brite episodes on tape a few years back, but I think the movie is much better! My little brother saw it last week, and he's totally for it! Oh, and if some of you anime fans out there like shows like Sailor Moon, you'll like this, too! Get it and you'll see what I mean!
5880	great: As I was reading this book I though about life and the things that could happen, I laugh most of the time is was great ..... Thanks for such a close to life story .... Luz
5881	sloppy and doesn't tell the essential story: Read the book on Badfinger - Without You: The Tragic Story Of Badfinger. This is a poor production.
5882	Fun for everyone: I love Disney! This movie is great for children and adults. I love how the movie has a lesson about pride and honor in it. I also love the animation and the funny parts too...so it has something for both kids and adults. The price right at $1.99 for a 48 hour rental...you can't beat that! :) This was the first time I saw this movie and I love it so much I watched it twice within the 48 hour period. I would recommend this product to both kids and adults. Even though, this was a rental, I would definitely purchase/rent this movie again.
5883	entertains 9 month old!: bought for my first grandchild, she is now almost 5, will play with it still, my 9 month old also loves to play with it. the doors do pop off, they don't seem to mind.
5884	Native History: I ordered the book and received it fast & in the condition stated. I have not had the time to read it yet, but I am happy with my purchase.
5885	NO Optical Digital output!: I have no opinion on the performance of this unit since I required the optical digital output to complete the installation of this unit to my receiver. (My receiver has one coaxial digital-audio input which is already occupied by the cable TV's signal but two unused optical digital-audio inputs). The specs for this unit promises an optical digital-audio output, but this DVD player has none.
5886	Dame this game was bad: dark angel plain and simple sucked the controls dont respond when you need them to bad fighting engine bad voice-overs jessica alba could have done better and the characters don't look like the actors avoid this game like the flesh eating virus when or if you come in contact with this game run like hell
5887	Isn't what I expected!: This is the arcade version (Old Version). This game doesn't add any especial when played in the Playstation Systems.
5888	Too bitter: I hardly order chai teai, then I tried Tazo chai tea, due to the nice reviews on Stash brand and cheaper price I went for it. Way too bitter in comparison to Tazo, I used almost 10 ounces of water and I wasn't able to finish my cup. It is very bitter!!! Be aware, and only buy it if you like real real strong black tea. As a matter of fact is more like black tea than chai.Keep in mind I am not a tea expert, but if I like a nice cup of tea, and never have not finished one, like in this case.
5889	This band was great when they were Alice In Chains!: I honestly used to like Godsmack but as i got older my music taste matured and I found out how great "Grunge" is (the best kind of rock music) I ventured upon Alice In Chains cd "Dirt" I was blown away by how good this cd is. Quickly I realized how bad Godsmack rips AIC off. To the point where it makes me sick. I mean I have nothing against being influenced by a band but to copy their sound exactly is stealing is should be a crime. DO NOT BUY THIS CD AND DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BAND!!!!!! The name Godsmack even comes from a AIC chains song called "God Smack". It really cant get any worse than this, or can it? It can! I heard Godsmack is now coming out with an aucustic EP. Alice In Chains Had two Aucustic EP's one called "Sap" and the other one called "Jar Of Flies". Dont buy this cd buy AIC cd "Dirt" or "Facelift" They are way better than any Godsmack record. Don't support a band with no original sound or talent!
5890	A quick reference for psychiatric emergencies: This poket book is a quick and easy reference for pshysician in an emergency room dealing with psychiatric emergencies. The part that refers to Organic Mental Syndroms (as Delirium and Dementia) is very interesting and useful for general clinical practicers. The mental conditions are divided in alphabetical order, making it easier to search the subjects; and each one describe the diagnostic criteria and guidelines for treatment. This is really an usefull book for the physician in primary care unit.
5891	Save your money. One of Clancy's worst.: The book draaaaaaaags on and on and on and on. The plot is thin and the entire book lacks the usual Clancy spark present in most of his previous adventures. The ending really leaves you hanging with no definite conclusion. The plot is plausible, although, in reality, political assassinations have been happening for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, so this story is nothing new.Save your money on this one. Its definitely not worth it.
5892	LOVE IT!!: I have used "Design" by Paul Sebastian for many years and love it!! Not available in stores but only online.
5893	What a ripoff!!!!: This is the worst piece of rubbish I've ever been conned into buying!If you want to watch a bunch of unauthorized Neil Young biographers talk about Neil for 88 mins, knock yourself out.The unseen clips have all been on YouTube and are a lot longer there than the few seconds you get on this DVD.It took me about 10 minutes to realize I'd been had!This is NOT an authorized Neil Young release.I was unbelievably disappointed after waiting in anticipation for this to be released.I wish I could give it -5 stars!!You have been warned!!!!
5894	*****excelent*****: I fell in love with this movie when I first seen it almost Thirty years ago, I have seen it over 300 times since. THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY has a uniqueness that has never been surpassed and may never be. It is a ONE OF A KIND western with nothing to compare to start a rating from. See it for Your self and I am sure You will agree.You ask to rate this movie, But the rating chart doesnt go to 10. I first seen THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY almost thirty years ago, and fell in ove with it, have seen it over 300 times since. This is a one of a kind western, its uniqueness has not been urpassed and I belive it never will be. Pleas see for your self, I am sure You will agree.
5895	breaks new ground for terrible: So, first off, I bought this album the day it came out. And promptly returned it. Three months later I was convinced by a friend to "give it a second chance." Two weeks (and more than a few *painful* listens) later I returned it again. Why?Because this is an unemotional, flat, uninspired, commercial record.The blue album was interesting and fun; pinkerton was masterful and sweeping--but shallow-minded popular critics panned it. Unfortunitially Rivers appeared to care what they said and ran away. Now he's back, but in such a hollow, cheap, mass-produced format that it isn't worth owning. Ganted some rabid people will cry out "but it's still WEEZER!"-- though they fail to see that it's not the weezer with talent, with grace, with candor that we knew.sigh... if you want good, interesting, and intelligent reviews (much MUCH better than mine) go to pitchforkmedia.
5896	Only for people who are sure they wont want more: When I first bought this cd, I loved it, but it left me wanting more, so i bought the Heart and Soul box set and I sold this cd. I felt kinda stupid because I basically lost $ (because i got $ for selling it). I have become a huge fan of Joy Division and own most of their cds, including the bootleg cd, Remains. I only reccomend this to people who are sure they arent going to want get all JD cds or people who are collectors. Other than that, the Cd is excellent. But, the Cd I reccomend for an introduction is the cd, Still. Because even if you become a big fan of JD (like I did) you will still have a purpose of having it, because of the rare cover song "Sister Ray" and recordings from their last concert (all of which are not on the Heart and Soul box set).
5897	a wonderful movie: this is probably the best made for tv movie I have ever seen. I got it this past christmas, when my local pbs station dumped "chef", and I was dying for some good english comedy to view. This movie didnt dissapoint. Its written by the man who did blackadder- so it, like black adder gets better with repeated viewings.... Henry is a comic genius and Cuming.. .well lets just say, thanks to this, I have tickets to see him on Broadway! An absolutely delightful film, and a welcome addition to anyones video collection.
5898	One Star for Effort: What a disappointmet! Rather by the CD single of "Brand New Day" - it is the only song on the album that is up to Sting's usual standard.I have bought all of Sting's previous albums and enjoyed them but I cannot say the same for this album.
5899	Comentario Sobre la Edicion en Dvd de Camaleones: Al principio no me atrapo la idea de Tener el Dvd de Camaleones, ya que solo habia visto Originalmente el Primer Episodio Completo, luego de hacer unos balances y de pensar Decidi apostar por el Dvd ya que me demanda menos tiempo que viendola por Television o a travez de Internet.Me Gusta Mucho Belinda y Alfonso Herrera, hacen una Linda Pareja, por otra parte Me Tienta Mucho la Actuacion Estelar de Edith Gonzalez y Confio en que es Muy Buena en lo que hace, he visto muchas Novelas con ella y Me Encanto.La Trama parece estar buena y ser una Novela Vanguardista. Espero no desepcionarme...Cuando tenga el Dvd y lo vea les cuento que tal esta la Novela y el Resumen...9/8/2011: Buen Dvd, Contiene un Resumen de 13 Horas, 9 Minutos con Lo Mas Importante de la Novela, ademas Trae Bloopers, Videoclips del Grupo, Detras de Camaras etc... Esta Muy Bueno, Lo Recomiendo!!!
5900	Did not recieve. Sent email inquiry.: Tracking data showed should have been received by 11-3-10. Sent email quiery on 11-23-10. No reply yet. Very unhappy. Sincerely, Patricia Bardwell
5901	Best Shakespeare bio: We have read several Shakespeare biographies. This one blows them all out of the water. It was very engaging and incredibly informative. My child and I both learned so much! This was the first book we've read by this author, but we can't wait to try more!
5902	SURPRISE! a HUGE scoop of disappointment...: How would I rate this item? Hmm.. somewhat useable, but overpriced. At $34 one would think they were getting a pretty good deal; until you inspect the crummy spot welds on the flimsy sheet metal. Whatever you do, DO NOT use your foot to gain leverage with the scoop when digging. It will crumple. And after a few hours of digging and scooping, the welds popped loose. All of the digging took place in medium-packed sand. It would have lasted a fraction of the time in the hard-pack down by the water I'm sure. If I had it to do all over again, I'd either only use it to sift through the really powdery stuff or not use it at all. $34 was a pretty steep price to pay for this "discard after use" item.Looks like I got sifted on this one...-KS-
5903	Hardy toy that is louder than expected: My 2 y/o toddler son loves this toy and play with it often. The bulldozer plays music, makes a few sounds and says "Caterpillar Power" pretty loud. I will make sure to move this toy to son's room so that it is not in area where I will be with my newborn. Other than the noise, this is a fun toy for him to play with in/outside.
5904	poor: Lets see;#1 unit has a small pee hole in main pipe.#2 Does not stay tight ...Cannot be finger adjusted as it will just slowly fall.I went ahead and sealed the hole with JB weld and wrenched the adjustments tight so it is no longer adjustable only because it wasn't worth the hassle of returning.
5905	Kitchen Smells Like A Chinese Canal With Dead Fish In It: I bought this product at Wal-Mart. There was no outstanding, bold notice on the box that it contained SHRIMP PASTE in it, which is whole shrimp, legs, heads, tails, all ground to mush, and is extremely fishy-smelling.I followed the instructions - add water to fill line, then add all of the packages, which are not labeled, then added the noodles. I microwaved this product in the company kitchen break room, and now it stinks like a Chinese canal full of dead fish.After cooking the product as directed, I peered inside the open box. UGH. It looked like a bloody red concoction of fish innards. The odor was incredibly BAD. Instead of tossing the box into the kitchen trash I had to toss the box in the outside dumpster.While I do enjoy seafood, this horrible prank of a product stinks really bad. If you really enjoy the foul odor of dead fish, buy this product. Or, if you want to play a rude practical joke on your co-workers, go for it.
5906	worst movie of all time: amateurish plot and action. terrible.. a kinder garden kid could've made a better movie. is easily one of the most brain-dead movies of all time that I've watched!
5907	Clay Aiken-The Voice!: Listening to Clay Aiken, one would have to wonder how this guy could not win a talent competition. He is better than the winner, Ruben Studdard, by far. Some dismiss his beautiful voice as "broadway" because it is powerful and he sings with amazing range and depth. I don't see the problem there. Many of the best known singers, in the past and today, are remembered for thier powerful voices. Nobody is going to care about Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, or 50 Cent ten years in the future. They are novelty acts. Clay Aiken is the real thing.He sings Bridge Over Troubled Water with such depth and emotion. It's even better than Simon and Garfunkel's version. He just has the ability to take a song and turn it into a Clay Aiken song.This is the Night is sung with such a soaring passion. One can't help but get sucked into it.
5908	Misconceptions: Knowing the history and facts behind this fictional story gives alot of perspective on this paticular review. For any individual that had or has access to any of the actual public and sealed documents concerning this case, it tends to leave a great deal of food for thought.When a mistake is made by any government agency, of course, it's an embarrassment, especially considering the last couple of decades for a reminder.Some folks in this great nation are finally realizing that our government and law enforcement agencies are not infallible and that when put in a compromising position will do just about anything to save face and funds.It's not a pleasent reality that this portrays, but unfortunately true.If given the oportunity to find fact from fiction, would you take it??
5909	A tragedy...: This new translation takes all of the poetry out of the Katherine Woods' translation. I use this new edition only to show my freshman students how crucial a good translator is. They actually laugh at the flatness of the language by Richard Howard. CAn't the publisher publish both editions and let the readers decide?
5910	Not Kirby At All: I don't like this Kirby game at all! Its boring sometimes frustrating and i thought Kirby didn't know English. I looked it up on the internet on The Kirby Wiki and found out sadly it was made by Americans and not the person who actually made Kirby. For people that love Tetris and the game Avalanche might like this game but i don't.
5911	FDOODS OF THE GREEK ISLANDS: What a wonderful book! Photographs are beautifully done, and a great selection of authentic recipes too. Would highly recommend this!
5912	I would say this machine sucks--: But that is the problem it doesn't, it only extracted 1/2 containerful of the 2 1/2 containers I used to clean the living room. Carpet wasn't just damp it was soaked took forever to dry. Can't recommend this Eureka product.
5913	This is the Oasis by Miriam Moss: "This is the Oasis" follows in the vein of Miriam Moss's previous book, "This is the Tree," about an African baobab tree. The book begins by looking at an oasis from a distance and detailing some common desert animals and phenomena as we move closer to the oasis itself. Once inside the oasis, author and illustrator show the inhabitants of the oasis, from fauna to humans. Every two page spread contains two concepts detailed in two stanzas and picked up in the illustrations. Each stanza begins with the phrase "This is the place..." which becomes wearisome, especially during a read aloud. The illustrations are colorful and appealing, making up for the text's deficiencies. The book serves well as a basic introduction to oasis living, but might inspire more questions than it answers. A short glossary at the end of the book expounds upon common desert names and terms, but still doesn't compensate for the slight, strained text of the bulk of the book.
5914	How to make the most from an online learning environment: Allan Henderson's E-LEARNING tells how to make the most from an online learning environment. From budgeting costs for e-learning to supporting employees who respond to e-learning opportunities, this is packed with interviews with experts plus examples of e-learning in sales, legal training and HR. An exciting survey.
5915	Dating Can Still Be Fun After 40: After being out of the dating game for so many years I am delighted I found this book. I no longer have my "pity parties" on the couch and get out more to meet people. Still haven't found someone, but am having fun trying.Also, I saw her recently on The Today Show with Katie Couric and was glad I did!
5916	Excellent Seller !!!: This Documentary is amazing i bought this for myself, I had seen it at the arc light in Hollywood. Being a fan of the show, If you are a fan, you will love this documentary.
5917	Losing it: Irvine Welsh phoned this one in. 'Porno' is yet another bland offering from Irvine Welsh, rehashing the formula used in 'Glue' and 'Filth' and just about every other book he's written: Chapter in English, chapter in 'Scottish', chapter involving gratuitous sex, chapter involving extreme violence/murder, chapter involving rape, chapter involving...etc. No real character development, a lame attempt at a shocking 'twist'. Glad I borrowed it from a friend rather than waste my money.
5918	Intolerable writing style: I'm sure there was some good advice in the book, but I couldn't abide the writing style. Every bit of advice is oversold as a Universal Law caused by Hitherto Unknown Physical Phenomena!!! I made it through 50 pages before throwing the books away.
5919	useless: I had the Oregon Scientific RM313PNA Self-Setting Projection Clock. I had it for 10 years and it worked perfectly. It broke, and frys only carries THIS clock now. So I bought it. Mistake. I should have just bought the Oregon Scientific one again through Amazon.The La Crosse 1) does not come with directions, and is nearly useless without them.2) can not tell time. I left it plugged in for 2 days an it never told the correct time. I set the clock manually, and after only 2 hours it was 15 minutes off. After 6 hours it was about an hour off.This thing sucks.The coolest part is that you can aim the projector, but what use is that, if it projects the wrong time?
5920	A Complete Waste of Time: I started to read Johanna Lindsey to see why she's a bestselling author. Frankly I'm still trying to figure it out. The whole book was incredibly silly, and there were plot holes you could drive a truck through. I guess once you're a name like Lindsy you don't have to try any more (I understand some of her earlier books are quite good). I guess it could also be that futuristic fantasy type stuff doesn't work for me, but even the romance portion was pretty dull stuff.
5921	What's the big deal?: I bought this book because I thought it would provide some insight into the world of mental illness. I was sorely disappointed.
5922	Wow!: Prior to receiving this book as a gift from my wife, I had not read Rosenberg. Now I am a fan. To me it seems that it shouldn't matter if you are a prophecy believer or not. The writing is first-rate with great pacing. My only critique is that there were too many characters for my liking. I felt like I needed an organizational chart at times.While I don't buy into prophecy scenarios, I did find that this book left a lasting impression. Now when I watch the news or read news magazines ; stories that contain both Russia and Iran aspects really stick out. When I watch or read I do so with an eye toward this book. It is somewhat spooky the way things are lining up... Maybe it is just confirmation bias on my part.Michael L. Gooch
5923	Unfortunate: We ordered 2 of these for an upcoming camping trip. The first of the cots arrived broken. Both fasteners for the middle supports were cracked off. The second cot was in fine shape, but the support running across the length of the cot was immediately uncomfortable for our son. I'm in the process of returning both cots and we have already purchased a replacement cot that our son enjoys.
5924	Taking Pictures For Your eBay Items PRICELESS: I recieved the book today and could'nt put it down. I went out and bought supplies for my own little picture taking studio! I thoughrt i knew how to take a great picture of my item's but was i wrong. I learned so much from this informative and easy to read book.The detail is execellent and he breaks everything down for even a beginner.The best investment you'll make if you plan on selling ANYTHING online.This IS THE BOOK!
5925	Future Sound of London's Worst: I am an FSOL fan, and out of 5 CDs I own by them, I rate this one last. The sound is overly harsh and droning in some places and empty and cold in others. We Have Explosive, the most well known track, is mindless techno. On a whole the sound is uncoordinated. If you are interested in techno music and thought this CD would be a good intro, think again, this album left no mark in the underground techno community and recieved no praise, it is worthless mainstream techno with only a few redeeming tracks 6 and 10. Accelerator by the Future Sound of London is better album by far and it had a true impact on the underground in its time, get it instead.
5926	Intelligent Mystery: Another in her series of intelligent, literate mysteries, with her protagonist Guido Brunetti and his university professor wife, Paola, and their two teenaged children. A delight. Subtle, funny, and clever.
5927	Decent product: I just got this Sno-Brum, and I like it for the most part,It helps remove a large section of snow faster than the a regular snow brush , and it has an extended handle which allows ease of use, However the telescoping handle does not securely lock in place, and falls out very easily, it has a cheap plastic lock which is very fragile, so you have to be careful when using it not to break it.
5928	Making The Grade: Diffuser's album Making The Grade is an above average attempt at a record for the masses. Heartfelt, easy to relate to lyrics paired with rock instrumentation give this band one decent addition to anyone's collection. "New High", "Get It On", and "I Wonder" are definately not your average uptempo hits, nor are they what makes this band different from the rest; songs including "Breakaway", "Nothing Left To Say", and "She's All Mine" are just the right type of calm, serene, slower balads that seperate them from all the other new alterna-pop/punk rock bands the new music scene is fueled by. A definate to take a few listens to.
5929	Characters you want to stay in touch with.: It is true you become a part of these people and the town. I look forward to my reading time but I'm getting depressed that I'm almost done with the fourth book in the series "Out to Canaan. Good news I see another book is coming out in April 1999 "A New Song" it starts where Out to Canaan leaves off.
5930	The drill itself worked extremely well...: Drill was strongly recommended to me to take with me on a Habitat for Humanity build this last month to Haiti The drill performed very well and would highly recommend to others. The battery was quick to charge. Note: Check the advertising, the seller stated came with two battieres but the package only came with one. Amazon were quick to correct the situation, but it was problematic for a while, until the back up plan took place.
5931	Sophomore effort: Someone gave me this CD as a gift, and it's amazing I still talk to the person. This CD is full of bland, flat performances from a strained, undertalented, overblown tenor who should have retired, or better yet, never have started his career.The only reason this CD is worth owning is to have a recording of Hoiby's "Be Not Afeard" which is a beautiful piece totally murdered by the performer.On the bright side, this is a perfect gift for someone you hate!
5932	Ridiculous Inflation: Only 8 months ago this exact product was $27 shipped, and the price has since slowly but steadily risen. Just a month or two ago it was around $30. Now it's $45 for the cheapest. That is a 60% increase. Are the ingredients becoming more expensive? The other brand's prices have remained consistent. Now it is not the cheapest whey (for the protein/cost) so it really has no advantage anymore, because it does not taste as good as the other brands. Chocolate surge tastes bad in water. It all tastes adequate or worse.
5933	A disappointment: Another reviewer started out his review with the question: Did we read the same book? Those are my exact sentiments to the reviewers who praised this work.Doctorow has always been a difficult read to me. Although I loved the musical RAGTIME, I found the book difficult to read. At that point I gave up on his books. Had I taken that pattern into consideration, I would not have bothered with THE MARCH.As usual Doctorow has a "shotgun" - scattered approach to his characters. You get a little bit of various characters who eventually interact. As a result, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters, except perhaps Pearl, the mulatto former slave.I'm sure that THE MARCH will become a movie. Sean Penn will be great as Arly and Hallie Berry will play Pearl. The screen writer will tighten up the story as did the writer for Ragtime, the musical.General Sherman makes limited appearances in the story.The only strong point of the novel is the demonstration of the brutality of war.
5934	My boys love it!: I was not so excited about the price but the good reviews on Amazon convinced me to purchase it for my boys. They are 1 and 2. They love it! This set is HUGE. Make sure you have space in your home for something like this. We put it between our two sofas in the living room for now. We plan to move it to their playroom as soon as we do some rearranging in there. The boys have knocked it down playing rough inside the hut. It just pops right back. The setup was super easy. If you don't have a room big enough for the entire play hut then it can easily be setup into two smaller units that are still fun. Great buy. I wished I would have discovered this sooner. This would have really helped out during our snow days and just really cold days when we just didn't leave the house. Also, I plan to take some parts of this unit when we travel this summer.
5935	Out-in Techniques Usually don't work: I was attracted to the book from his title and by the high marks it had from previous reviews but after reading it I found that most topics are about techniques and do not try to get to the problem of low self-esteem with an In-Out method, instead it's mearly ways to imagine your problem from different angles using pure imagination. the author could have summarized the book in 31 pages about the techniques which are useful to people who have the inside foundation of high self-esteem but are perplexed by the outside world. I would recommend the 7 habits of highly effective people as a foundation of any self improvement method.
5936	Terrible, Save Your Money: Mandy Moore was only fourteen or so when she recorded this album, and her voice hadn't matured yet. So what you get is this sort of whiny sound, but demi-sexual lyrics. The lyrics are okay, but really, her voice ruins it all. Some of her songs are just annoying to listen to, such as "Not Too Young", "Love Shot", "I Like It" ... almost half of the songs on her album seem to be filler songs. If I were you, I'd save my money and get her latest album, "Mandy Moore". Her voice is not as annoying and her lyrics are even better.
5937	All-Around Hit: I just bought this CD yesterday, and I haven't been able to stop listening to it. When I first heard their single "Flavor of the Weak", I absolutely loved it, although it kinda reminded me of other bands (like Newfound Glory and Blink-182). But when I listened to the CD, it had a sound completely its own. It has a full, mature sound to it, and can range from serious and edgy to fun and cheerful to slow and sweet. One thing that surprised me about the album is the lack of swearing. Although is has a warning on it, only 3 songs contain any "explicit lyrics". I would definitely recommend this to anyone into rock or punk.
5938	Yuk!: I generally like SEP's books though I think her straight romances are generally better than when when she tries to channel Sidney Sheldon. But I couldn't finish this one. I was almost halfway through when I realized I did like any of the characters. SEP at her worst.
5939	Beyond the Call of Duty: This is a great book about an American hero during the Vietnam war and about the different things he did in this war. It is an easy read and good for ages 12 and up. I would definitely recommend this book to older couples. It would be a great book for reading just for fun and because it is such an easy read if they needed to waste time for 20-30 minutes they could read this.
5940	A barely okay movie: After all the hype and five star reviews I finally watched this movie, and all I can say is that this is just a mediocre stab at filmmaking. There is nothing special about it. The plot is plain. The characters are boderline annoying. There a few good moments sprinkled thourghout, but they're too few and far between to redeem this pretensious film. Paul Giamatti's character has actually made me hate wine. See this movie if you must, but rent it first.
5941	Totally charming & enjoyable: Plenty of charm & wit and comic stupidity in this.Steve Martin is absolutely MARVELOUS in this role - and the role he plays is one you'll totally love. Intelligent, athletic, brave, sweet, charming and witty. You'll enjoy the scenes where he cleans the clocks of stupid men picking on his oversized nose - he does it with total style and humor. And the 20 insults (against his nose) that he comes up with himself are pretty funny.A cute adaptation of Shakesphere's famous Cyrano - although the nitwits who make up the fire department in this little town are just a little TOO stupid for my tastes.But this was indeed overall a charming and enjoyable movie.
5942	doing it your own way, not 'strictly ballroom'.: One of the best movies I have seen of this type. We have watched this movie at least twice a year since the beginning. Typical parent "where did I go wrong" to the corrupt head of the federation, everyone rings true. This movie also has a Cinderella story built in with Fran as Cinder. Enough pathos and hysterics for the whole crowd. Many memorable lines too.When will it be on DVD?????
5943	Excessive Shipping Charges: I was charged $19.96 for shipping 3- SanDisks weighing 8oz. or less!This was shipped via USPS Ground. I'm asking for a CREDIT!Allan WattAt this point I do not recommend JoWow!!!!!!!!!!
5944	small and charming: This is a very minor movie, but it benefits from its Parisian setting and will resonate with anyone who has met up after a long time with someone who was important to them and finds the conversation flowing as if their relationship had continued during that time. The makers wisely confine the movie to 80 minutes, any more would have been overblown. There simply isn't enough here to last any longer. I find it hard to understand the 5 star awards that some amazonies have bestowed on this movie. I can only conclude that they identify so strongly with one of the main characters or with their situation that they simply fail to see the movie's limitations.
5945	Falls Apart: Most tents, after they are assembled can be moved around like an empty box, the Stansport Cabana Privacy Shelter falls apart. You must spend an additional 20 minutes securing each joint with twine or it will just come apart when touched. Save your money. Buy a regular dome tent for changing instead.
5946	Wonderful Phantom: Great Performance, we love it very much and have already watched it multiple times. It is reallya treat that after the curtain descends we get to see previous Phantom's join in the celebrationalong with, of course, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Bravo indeed.
5947	What a great tool for saving $$ and helping others, too!: Stephanie's book teaches one not only how to save money themselves but then how to donate to their local food banks as well. Her philosophy impressed me because my family has been the recipient of the food stamp program in the past and I know the importance of filling our local food pantries.She has a great strategy for savings and a website that is free!
5948	I love Columbo, But the DVDs are terrible!: I love Columbo, but I hate when DVD companies cheaply make DVD sets and do nothing about it.I bought my first copy and Candidate for Crime froze and was unwatchable. Then my second copy did the same thing and also the third. Finally I went on Amazon U.K and Season three and It worked perfectly. The U.S copy is on 2 double sided discs, the region 2 version is on four discs. In my opinion if you have a region free DVD player, go with it.
5949	It's still a great story!: I enjoyed the new characters of the story and am still trying to figure out who and how they transported Grianne. Pen's talents add a wonderful flavor to the story. I wish that Terry Brooks could have given us a little bit more to chew on as to whom the ultimate catalyst for banishing Grianne and for what purpose.
5950	Trash: I had mine for 2 weeks then the charger quit. They sent me a new charger andthat lasted a few weeks then it quit. Gave up and just threw the thing out.Richard
5951	gets annoying real quick: well I got this a while ago, and at first, well it wasn't bad, it was catchy and a few songs stuck in my head, but I had been listening to it while I was out and busy, so when I actually sat down and listened to it and the lyrics, well I realized that it's quite awful! the lyrics don't mean anything! the music in the background is completely unoriginal...I mean they certainly didn't go out of their way to create this album.and also, what the hell is the difference between fall out boy and panic at the disco? this isn't real music. real music comes from the soul, it's like dna, no one has the same dna. well I guess there's cloning..
5952	150 of the Most Beautiful Songs Ever: Bought as a gift for my mom. Her comments - nice selection of nostalgic love songs. Arrangements are easy to play on the piano.
5953	Why?: Why was this book writtten? Does Ringo need money? The original Posleen series was fantastic. This and Callys War, they appear to be afterthoughts. Do authors cut and paste? Do they have left over thoughts that they throw together and call it a book?
5954	Not Authentic - Don't Be Fooled: I ordered this bag only to receive it and find out it is a cheap knock-off. And it is not even a convincing knock-off! It looks cheap. I thought ordering it through amazon would be safe. Not so.
5955	This is a weak movie with a few good action scenes...: Somewhere I heard that this is supposed to be as good or better than the Matrix, nothing could be farther from the truth. The good...it has a few cool scenes like the car rides, spiders, computer displays, chase scenes...that is not enough to make a movie good, it needs something else...can Spielberg say "good story/plot?". Special effects are pretty good, but I have seen better. The bad...the plot is very dull and stupid. It is all about how one man trips out over and over and over and over about his missing/dead son that dissapeared 6 years ago. The other part of the plot is about who killed the mother of a super future seeing psychic. Someone frames him, he runs and that is when you get the good action scenes. It has lots of talking and it leads not to something grand but in the end it is just another "who done it" movie. Dont waste your money in the theaters like I did, just rent it...if you MUST see it in theaters PLEASE see the matinee...
5956	CUT ERROR: Its a great labeler...when its working!When its not working ( and that happens a lot!) it will give you endless "Cut Error" messages and with each message, it will waste your expensive tape.I got a record of 26 "cut errors", and with each message a piece o tape was wasted. I checked the batteries, the label, the position of the labeler, the alignment of the stars...nothing helped, I guess its just a flawed machine period.If you purchase this labeler, make sure you stock up with tapes...and patience.My advice: don't even think of buying this expensive tape waster.
5957	Great Value: I'm so grad to order this kit with my ipod. The similar kits are sold for much more elsewhere.
5958	VERY GOOD: This is really a great metal album. Except for the song " DRIVE " ( which has the dubious merit of having one of the silliest lyrics ever written by a rock band !! )each track is a thunderous journey into metal's best. This Cd seems more like a follow-up to Bruce Dickinson's amazing twin albuns, " ACCIDENT OF BIRTH " and " THE CHEMICAL WEDDING ". To make proof of it, the producer is guitarrist Roy Z, who also contributed in a lot of the songwriting. Halford clearly searched for a winning team.
5959	Love Body Glow: Love the scent and the beautiful sheen it gives your skin. Scent is not overpowering. Makes you feel so good just applying it.
5960	Fine for kids, boring for older pokefans: I baight this game expecting it to have the depth of the other games. Those can keep me going for months on end. This one was fine, but once the story was over, I was done with it. I was actually falling asleep trying to go through the 37+ levels in some of these missions. and if you die, you have to start all over again! I'm sorry but I dont even have that attention span. All the levels look the same even though they are randomly generated, they use the same tiles over and over. like I said, one the story was dont, I got rid of it for credit twards one of the newer games like dimond or perl.Currently into Pokemon Ranger. Much better than this one. Highly recoment this one. Great side story.There is a reason they are makeing a movie from the Ranger story and not from the rescue team story...
5961	Kennth Cole Black smells and wears well: Kennth Cole Black is a really good value. KCB smells very nice(not too sweet, not too musky) and lasts a lot longer than my Armani Code and is more affordable.
5962	Really IS and Encyclopedia: For the record, let me state that I've been surfing for 20 years and got the bug, along with most others my age, watching The Endless Summer and getting captivated by the energy and beauty of the sport. This compilation, while very complete, really IS an encyclopedia...page, after page, after page. There are some useful tidbits of information strewn among the lengthy volume but a large majority of the book seems filled with fairly uninteresting, small, black and white photos, and biographies of just about anyone in the world who ever attempted to stand up on a board. Avoid this snore-fest and put your money into a nice hardcover coffee table book filled with glorious color shots of the world's tube riders...and leave all of the trivia to the wannabes.
5963	Wonderfully Easy Yet Very Informative!!!!!!!: I bought this book after my husband bought my SLR. I looked through several different books until I found this one. It is wonderfully discriptive and easy to understand. He shows you several different angles, examples, lightings of the same picture and tells you how to achieve it and how not to. Wonderful for first time photographers as well as intermediate.
5964	One of the best movies ever!: This has to be one of the best movies i've ever seen. I was surprised at how good it was because i had never even heard of it. I t is an excellent, if very depressing movie, and has most surprising ending ever(besides the sixth sense) so if you like movies that are a little different from your typical Hollywood blockbuster, check this one out. you wont be disappointed!
5965	Todos Vuelven DVD Part One: Ladies and Gentlemen- I am giving a fair review of the Ruben Blades "Todos Vuelven-Part 1 and 2" DVDs. He's certainly our legend on Salsa music. I really waited to receive those DVDs on my door from UPS. To my surprise and although the quality of the music on the DVD is okay, I am really disapointed that Ruben Blades and his production team put out such a poor quality DVDs on what I categorize as "the best concert of his lifetime." The video quality of the concert is poor. I attribute this to the poor production of the video recording. It should had been on HD as a minimum. I will still treasure both of those DVDs and add to my collection of music concerts, but wished this was done at a better quality and also done on one disk instead of 2 separate ones.
5966	The vogue sewing book: The sewing side was good. Clear and very helpful. It is intended for those doing garment construction, not alterations on ready made clothing. Wish I could find one for alterations on ready made.
5967	A message EVERYONE needs to hear and understand: Too much religion is in Christianity. Fear and guilt propel our relationship with God because so many Christians show God as angry and giving of His love only if we tow the line. God actually LOVES us!! Grasping this has been the hardest thing for me and James Richards brilliantly explains it with bible references so that you can stand strong in God's love. Read and feel God's peace. :)
5968	Stop looking at these and BUY IT!: Not being a big fan of MST3K this movie changed it all for me. The quick witted lines skillfully destroy "The Pod People" and leave the audience laughing b/c of how terrible the film is. Joel, Servo, and Crow manage to make this film not just bearable but also entertaining. I have watched this tape three times and then I have decided to purchase it. I don't know why you are actually still reading this you have a VHS to purchase!"Trumpy do you know how to play?""Yes, it's when I break you in half."
5969	Crucial Technology CT12864Z335 1GB 184-Pin PC2700 333Mhz DIMM DDR RAM Memory: It did not work at all in my computer. Before purchasing this memopry, I ran the Crucial memory test and it said this was the correct memory. I have to return it!
5970	very good indeed: Very good indeed for the purpose I decided to buy it. It is made with a thin blade, usefull for our daily needs.
5971	You will give account: All people will give an account to God for hurting his animal kingdom with these torture devices. There is enough devices that are humane to chooses from. Instead you choose the most vicious and cruel.
5972	Excellent movie.: I watched this movie 8 times, and I'm not done yet. It's packed with action from start to finish. The actors are very tallented. Jan De Bont the director was at his best!!!
5973	Refreshing & unpredictable: This book had a very unusual plot and unexpected ending. I loved getting to know the characters and observing how they reacted with each other. What happens when a group of people from all walks of life are forced into a situation where all of their roles, status, money, and skills are turned around. The poor have the power. The rich, sucessful are deamed powerless. And in a "hopeless" situation, people find love for each other and for the beauty of music and their own individual talents. I really enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it to others.
5974	These people do exist!: This book realistically captures the "High Rent" lifestyle of the New York rich-or for that matter the upper crust across the country. I will qualify this by saying that all the rich are not like the characters depicted in the book, but there are some underlying similarities. The young women in this book tries desparately to give some semblence of normalicy to the young boy in the book. His parents are too busy or uninterested to take any special notice of him-except what he will be wearing when he plays with other children. She basically ends up being an indentured servant dealing with unrealistic requests from the spoiled parents. I know some people like Mrs. X in the book who go from massage appointments, to nail appointments to luncheons, but they treat their children much better. I am glad that the book was not too life-like.I loved this book. You can tell by the authors' refrences that hey are very familiar with their subjects.
5975	not a good choice: First off you dont get the bottle in the picture. Once i recieved my bottle I read the directions and decided to start with 2 capsils the first night to see how my body reacted, the next morning nothing happend. So the next night I took 4 capsils and that morning still no BM so than i took 4 more that morning and again nothing. So after taking 10 capsils in 2 days nothing has happend...I dont like to give bad reviews (this is a first) but these are very over priced and not worth it I wish I didnt waste my money but at least I have learned my lesson and I will stick with my 5$ box of smooth move herbal tea.
5976	Excellent!: A page turner! I read several Koontz books, but this one is excellent - it manages to keep the pace without any supernatural elements coming into the story.
5977	Doesn't work with Windows XP Media Center: I just replaced my old computer after the hard drive died with a new XP Media Center machine. I had all of my data backed up on the Acomdata USB 2.0/Firewire external hard drive and thought it would be a snap to move it over to the new computer. Wrong!! The external drive couldn't be seen by the new computer. I went to the Acomdata website where they said that this model isn't supported in the Media Center Edition at this time. So it's on to Plan B, C, and D to get my data back. Next time I'll buy a "name" brand that stays current with what's out there.
5978	Excellent playing from Chick and Co.: It's good to know that Chick Corea is recording more albums in the acoustic format, and I hope it stays that way. His solos are best heard on acoustic piano, and this Powell tribute attests to his gift for inventive improvisations. There is much energy on this recording, slowing down only on "I'll Keep Loving You" and picking up again on "Tempus Fugit", before Corea closes the album with a pretty good solo piano take on "Celia."
5979	Don't bother - poor battery life: I'll be trying to return this product. After charging the batteries for about 3-4 days, I was able to get 10 minutes from the unit trimming the grass. What a waste.
5980	Contracting Your Home- A Great Place to start: I found this book to be what I was looking for, unlike some other books, this one gives you facts and information that I could use. We are currently under construction and I use the check list, the time lines, and the sample sheets to help me stay organized. This is a meat and potatoes type of book for the person that is serious about building. I higly recommend this book.
5981	Have not recieved it yet :{: iCAN NOT REVIEW SOMTHING i HAVE YET TO RECIEVE AND HAVE YET TO GET A RESPONSE FROM THE PERSON i ORDERED IT FROM. If you can help with this I would greatly appreciate it.-K.
5982	Overall, there is no need to purchase this card set: The main problem with OrgoCards is that it is not really a set of two sided flash cards. It is simply a shortened text book in card form. The cards are not 3 X 5 index cards and they contain a lot of information on them, much of which is not really necessary. You are better off making your own flashcards.
5983	How are the mighty fallen: I've heard people say that this book is good and funny if you're a SF fan. Well, all I can say is that I've been an SF fan for over 40 years and I was nauseated by this book. The chances are slim that anyone who's not a fan would ever hear of this piece of garbage, but on the off chance that they did, I would hope they might consider that being an SF fan used to be a badge of honor. Nowadays it apparently just means you're a Rush Limbaugh dittohead with a light saber. Honestly, we're not all as braindead as this book would have you believe. This is probably the most insulting, ignorant, and wrongheaded novel I've ever read.Help save the Earth and burn this book.
5984	A Great Read: I love this book! I read though this in no time. I then got to read the second book, and found it was just as good if not better than the first. I can't wait for the third book to come out. It is a really charming tale and will make you laugh. I recommend this for those looking for a fun book to pass the time. Read it! You'll love it!
5985	Go Ella Go!: This is among my favorite 3 Black LAce Books. There is one scene I still like to re-read on occasion, and I rarely get off on the same passage twice. I envy the good-times the main character has with so many different people, and the frequent setting changes make for good atmosphere.
5986	The Theory of Money and Credit: The Theory of Money and Credit.This book is anti-communist propaganda. It isn't the scholarly study of economics that the title would suggest.
5987	The new generation Dave Chappell: The production value is high. The acting and writing is spot on and these two actors are very versatile. Sketch comedy is at a new level.
5988	Master performances: Claudio Arrau is my favorite pianist in the Beethoven and Chopin repertories; this recording is particularly fine aesthetically. This "package" is a treat for devotees of Beethoven or Arrau.
5989	This is more about Modern Physics than Buddhism: Although he does say a few things about Buddhist philosophy, the actual role of the Dalai Lama in these discussions turned out to be acting as the perfect "straight man" for a presentation of some of the bizarreness of modern physics: intelligent but not indoctrinated into the belief that everything "scientific" is necessarily correct.Most of the material is more-or-less orthodox Quantum Mechanics. Some of the more far-out concepts, as Finkelstein admitted, may not last as long as the end of next week.
5990	Leaves your skin dirty with white flakes: The sunscreen does block out the sun, the problem is that it leaves residue on your skin, I noticed white flakes on my skin and some spots of what looked like dirt,,I wouldnt buy it again.
5991	The Pain is here: Previous Smackdown games had easier controls and fast-paced gameplay but this one complicates the grappling and reverse controls, which can wear on your fingers over time. There is a pain meter which makes high falls and injured regions of the body more realistic than the previous games in the series. There are few high profile legends in this game like Jimmy Snuka, the Road Warriors and Sgt. Slaughter. The CAW is not much different from last year's game and the season mode lasts for only a year but has an easier way to talk to superstars backstage. The elimination chamber is good but the bra and panties match becomes redundant after a few times. It is the best wrestling game on the market right now but that is not saying much if you played the ones for the other systems.
5992	Who better to redo a CLASSIC than a true classic herself!!!: Every singer wants to put his/her singular stamp on a song associated with another. And who better to do than the divine Patti Labelle, one of music's premier songstresses.This 14-set collection of covers is nothing short of a masterpiece, with Labelle in perfect form as she assays songs formerly performed by Aretha ("Ain't No Way"), Michael ("He's Out of My Life," altered to fit Patti's gender), Deniece Williams ("Silly"), Michael McDonald ("I Keep Forgetting"), Elton John ("Your Song"), LTD ("Love Ballad") and The Delfonics ("Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time").Changing very little with the instrumentation, background vocals, and rhythm tracks, the singer gets to put her trademark vocals on each of the familiar songs.If the singer loses a star, it's for the dress she sports on the cover."Scarlett O'Hara" looked better in the curtain creation!
5993	Don't waste your money on this garbage: Everyone knows that Dr. Phillys Mindell is no executive herself. We all know she got her diplomas off eBay. She is not mentally stable and her books are old, have not been updated in 10+ years and the content is pure garbage. How can she call herself a professional writer if she does not update her material? I can also call myself a professional anything, how about a professional bus drive?Everyone knows is pure garbage just like all her books. Maybe she should start writing history books about the glory days she never had.Her technique is outdated good for third grader readers, at least the book was cheaper than a roll toilet paper. I am glad I was able to find use for it. Not a complete waste of my 25 cents.Do yourself a favor and purchase a current book from a real author and not some lunatic pretending to be an author.
5994	Wake me when its over: This book just went no where fast. I ended up deleting it from my kindle. Even for $2.99 it was a dud.
5995	Enjoyable mystery: I got this book simply because it was free for the Kindle, and I was trying to load my new Kindle 3 with as many free books as I could. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this story. It's a light mystery but it kept me reading, as I just had to find out who was behind everything. I will most likely buy the other (Kindle version) books in this series.
5996	Beautiful and Spiritual: This is a very beautiful album with a spiritual feel to it. Listening takes you on a journey. If you just sit back and let yourself get lost in the music, you never know where you'll end up in your mind. This album has Middle Eastern notes to it, and the whole thing is great.
5997	Another Cash In: This cd is pure dreck and it's just another example of the "flavor of the month" actor/wanna be singer trying to cash in on his current notoriety. Geared toward the ghetto illiterates with the dirty raps,language and moronic lyrics. Just goes to show what passes for entertainment these days. I wish all these half wits that are praising this piece of crap would learn how to spell first. You have no business posting a review on here. Go back to school or stay in the projects! No stars for the cd at all.
5998	Concept drawings-very good: The concept drawings and costume designs are very detailed. The script evokes deeper feelings than you would imagine after seeing the movie (many were hidden).P.S. The Rebo Band rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!
5999	I hear i all the time is awsome: this is great when you first hear you think its ok but after you listen to it a few times you will love it ive been hearing it since christmasif you like long road and sliver side up you will love this one
6000	Not so great Performance: This mouse is very small & the retractable cable is a really good feature as it avoids tangling with other wires. But the latch of the retractable cable is really weak & mine was broken within the couple of weeks of use. The mouse is working fine till the date(I Purchased about a month ago) I have used other notebook mice before & think that this is not as par with other branded products in the market.
